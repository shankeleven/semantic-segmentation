The Commissioner Of Sales-Tax,Eastern ... vs Husenali Adamji And Co on 21 April, 1959	Case Title
& CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 13 of 1958. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated June 29, 1954, of the former Nagpur High Court in Misc. Civil Case No. 219 of 1952.
1959. April 21. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS, C. J.-This is an appeal by special leave, against the order of the High Court of Judicature at Nagpur dated June 29, 1954, answering against the appellant certain questions referred to it by the Board of Revenue under s. 23(1) of the Central Provinces & Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947 (hereinafter referred to as "the Act"). The reference arose out of an order of assessment made on the respondent for' payment of sales tax for the period June 1, 1947, to November 12, 1947, on a taxable turnover of Rs. 30,067-9-0.	Issue
The facts leading up to the present -appeal may shortly be stated as follows. The respondent deals in matchwood called " sawar " (Bombay- Malabaricum). His place of business is situate at Chanda in the erstwhile Central Provinces. In January 1948 the respondent entered into an agreement with the Western India Match Co. Ltd., which is popularly known and will hereinafter be referred to as " WIMCO " for the supply of a minimum quantity of 2,500 tons of sawar logs during the season 1947-48. This agreement is evidenced by WIMCO's letter dated January 7, 1948, accepting and confirming it. Unfortunately that letter, although a part of the record, has not been printed in the Paper Book. It is common ground, however, that the agreement of sale was subject to the conditions appearing in a formal contract in writing dated March 2, 1945, which is said to have been renewed from year to year. It appears that prior to the execution of the last mentioned contract there was another contract between the respondent and WIMCO which was dated October 18, 1940. Evidently that contract was superseded by the later one of March 2, 1945, the terms and conditions whereof were renewed year after year. It is, therefore, not easily intelligible why both the contracts were filed before the Sales Tax authorities and actually mentioned in the first question that was referred to the Hight Court. Both the contracts have been printed in the Paper Book and reference has been made to some of the terms of both of them in the course of the arguments before us. The reason for referring to the terms of the ,earlier contract is presumably to emphasise the variation in the language used in the corresponding provisions of the later contract as indicative of a definite change in the intention of the parties. It is, therefore, as well that the relevant clauses of both the contracts should be set out here for properly following the arguments advanced on both sides.
Pursuant to the agreement between the respondent and WIMCO, the former loaded diverse quantities of Sawar logs on railway wagons and despatched the same by railway from Chanda or other railway stations in the Central Provinces to Ambernath in the erstwhile province of Bombay and outside the Central Provinces. It is not disputed that on many occasions the representative of WIMCO was present at the railway station when the logs were sorted out and loaded into the wagons. The statement of the case submitted along with the reference under s. 23(1) of the Act is silent on the point as to whether the railway receipts were made out with WIMCO as the consignee; but it is abundantly clear from the order of the Assistant Commissioner, Sales Tax, which is part of the record -and it has not been disputed before us- that " the railway receipt which is a document of title according to s. 2(4) of the Indian Sale of Goods Act is taken in the name of the consignee." The course of dealings between the parties also appears to be that, on arrival of the logs at Ambernath, the consignee buyer WIMCO, paid the railway freight and the logs were inspected and measured by WIMCO's Factory Manager and the prices, calculated at the agreed rates, were paid to the respondent's agent at Bombay. There is no doubt that the price of the logs supplied by the respondent to WIMCO under the agreement and accepted by the latter during the period in question amounted to Rs. 30,067- 9-0. The question for our decision is whether the respondent is liable to pay any sales tax under the Act.
The respondent preferred what in form appeared to be a second appeal to the Board of Revenue. As, however, there could be no second appeal under s. 22(4) of the Act, the Board treated the memorandum of appeal as an application for revision under sub-s. 5 of s. 22 of the Act read with r. 57. Both the members of the, Board of Revenue came to the same conclusion, namely, that the sales were liable to assessment under the Act, but the reasonings adopted by them were somewhat different. Shri Shrivastava, a member of the Board of Revenue, took the view that as soon as logs answering the description agreed upon were brought to the railhead at Chanda and sorted out and loaded in the wagons in the presence of WIMCO's re- presentatives, there was an implied contract of sale of specific and ascertained goods, as evidenced by the conduct of parties and the property in each consignment passed immediately from the respondent to WIMCO at the railway station in the Central Provinces where such implied contracts were made. The Chairman of the Board of Revenue, however, took the view that the contract of sale was made outside the Central Provinces, namely, in Bombay and that, under the Sale of Goods Act, the property in the logs passed to WIMCO in Ambernath outside the province but that as the logs were in the Central Provinces, either in the form of logs or in the form immediately preceding, namely, trees standing on the land which had been impliedly agreed to be severed from the land before actual sale, Explanation II to s. 2(g) of the Act applied and the sale must, accordingly,	Facts

-be deemed to have taken place within the Central Provinces and, must, therefore, be liable to sales tax under the Act. The Board rejected the application but remitted the penalty. On the application of the respondent under s. 23(1) of the Act, the Board of Revenue submitted to the High Court a statement of case raising the following questions:-
The learned counsel for the department appearing in support of this appeal contends that property in the logs passed from the respondents to WIMCO under s. 23 when sawar logs were brought to the railway station and loaded in the wagon and the railway receipts taken in the name of WIMCO were forwarded to the latter. There was an unconditional appropriation of the goods to the contract by the respondent. There was, according to learned counsel, assent on the part of WIMCO to this appropriation in two ways, namely, (a) expressly given by its representative who was present at the railway station, and (b) impliedly given by WIMCO by having agreed in advance that the goods should be despatched by rail from the stations mentioned in cl. 4 of the agreement, all of which were situate in the Central Provinces.	RespArg
because under the Explanation the goods, in respect of which the contract of sale is made, must, at the date of the contract be in existence in the Central Provinces, that is to say, that the goods must at the date of the contract be there in the form in which they are agreed to be sold and there was no evidence, in the present case, for this.

In its judgment dated June 29, 1954, the High Court took the view that the sales in question did not take place in the Central Provinces and Berar and consequently were not "
The effect of the answers being to nullify the assessment order, the Commissioner of Sales Tax has come up on appeal before us after obtaining special leave of this Court. The answers to the first two questions have not been questioned before us. The main arguments have centred round the answers to questions 3 and 4. The answer to question 3 turned on the construction placed by the High Court on s. 23 of the Sale of Goods Act. After quoting s. 23, the High Court observed as follows:-
Therefore, the decision of the High Court cannot be assailed but must be accepted as well-founded in fact and in law. Learned counsel for the department then falls back upon the Argument founded on Explanation- II to s. 2(g) and 'argues, somewhat halfheartedly, that notwithstanding the provisions of the Sale of Goods Act regarding the passing of property in the goods the sale under consideration must be deemed, in the light of that Explanation, to have taken place within the Central Provinces. The question of the constitutional validity of that Explanation was not raised in the High Court and indeed, in view of the decision of this Court in Poppatlal Shah v. State of Madras (1) and other' cases, cannot now be raised and we must proceed on the footing that Explanation 11 did not transgress the legislative competency of the Legislature which enacted the same. It will be noticed that Explanation II can apply only if the goods " in respect of " which the contract of sale is entered into are, at the date of such contract, actually in the Central Provinces. Learned counsel for the department urges that the logs delivered must have been in existence in the Central Provinces either in the shape of ';logs or in the shape of standing timber. There is no evidence that at the date when the agreement for sale was made, the particular logs delivered thereunder were in the Central Provinces in the shape of logs at all. Learned counsel says that, at any rate, they must have been in existence there in the shape of standing timber. Apart from anything else,, the agreement here was riot " in respect of " any standing timber and there was no provision in the agreement as between the respondent and WIMCO for severance of the standing timber before sale under that agreement. In order to attract Explanation II the goods, in respect of which the contract of sale is made, must, at the date of the contract be in existence in the Central Provinces, that is to say, that the goods must at the date of the contract be there in the form in which they are agreed to be sold. There is not an iota of evidence on that point. In our judgment, there is no force in this alternative argument.	Precedent
Reference may first be made to the earlier contract dated October 18, 1940. Clause I sets out the specifications, that is to say, the dimensions and quality of the logs to be delivered under the contract which need not be reproduced here. The other material clauses, omitting the unnecessary portions thereof, may now be set out:-
The prices of the logs to be supplied are set out in cl. 6 of the contract as "F.O.R. Ambernath ".
We now pass on to the later contract of March 2, 1945. Clause 1 sets out the specifications of the logs to be supplied under the contract in exactly the same language as in el. I of the earlier contract. The other material clauses, again omitting the unnecessary portions, are as follows:-
The prices of the logs to be supplied under the contract are specified as " F.O.R. Ambernath " in cl. 7 which concludes with the following sentence:
It will be convenient at this stage to refer to the relevant provisions of law applicable to the facts of this case. Section 4 of that Act is the charging section. According to this section safes tax is payable " on all sales effected after the commencement of the Act." " Sale " is defined by s. 2(g) of the Act. At the relevant period, that section, omitting Explanation 1, which is not material for our purpose, ran as follows:-
The Act being a piece of legislation enacted by the legislature of the erstwhile Province of Central Provinces and Berar, its operation is limited to the territories of that province. Therefore, the question arises: Does the sum of Rs. 30,067-9-0 represent the prices of logs sold by the respondent within the Central Provinces ? Sale being the transfer of property in the goods agreed to be sold, we have to enquire if the property in the goods which fetched the sale proceeds on which the sales tax is sought to be levied was transferred in the Central Provinces as contemplated in the main definition or if those goods were actually in the Central Provinces at the time when the contract for sale as defined in the Sale of Goods Act in respect thereof was made as required by Explanation II set out above. This takes us to the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. Section 4 of the Sale of Goods Act is expressed in the words following:-
The transfer of property in the goods as between the seller and buyer is dealt with in Ch. III of the Sale of Goods Act. Section 18 of the Sale of Goods Act runs thus :
Passing over ss. 19 to 22 which (except as to sub-s. (3) of s. 19) apparently apply to contracts for the sale of specific or ascertained goods, we come to s. 23 which provides :-
Reference may next be made to s. 33 and s. 39(1). Section 33 says:-
Section 39(1) runs as follows:-	Section
The result, therefore, is that this appeal is dismissed with costs.
Appeal dismissed.	Conclusion
because under the Explanation the goods, in respect of which the contract of sale is made, must, at the date of the contract be in existence in the Central Provinces, that is to say, that the goods must at the date of the contract be there in the form in which they are agreed to be sold and there was no evidence, in the present case, for this.

1959. April 21. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS, C. J.-This is an appeal by special leave, against the order of the High Court of Judicature at Nagpur dated June 29, 1954, answering against the appellant certain questions referred to it by the Board of Revenue under s. 23(1) of the Central Provinces & Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947 (hereinafter referred to as "the Act"). The reference arose out of an order of assessment made on the respondent for' payment of sales tax for the period June 1, 1947, to November 12, 1947, on a taxable turnover of Rs. 30,067-9-0.
The facts leading up to the present -appeal may shortly be stated as follows. The respondent deals in matchwood called " sawar " (Bombay- Malabaricum). His place of business is situate at Chanda in the erstwhile Central Provinces. In January 1948 the respondent entered into an agreement with the Western India Match Co. Ltd., which is popularly known and will hereinafter be referred to as " WIMCO " for the supply of a minimum quantity of 2,500 tons of sawar logs during the season 1947-48. This agreement is evidenced by WIMCO's letter dated January 7, 1948, accepting and confirming it. Unfortunately that letter, although a part of the record, has not been printed in the Paper Book.

Evidently that contract was superseded by the later one of March 2, 1945, the terms and conditions whereof were renewed year after year. It is, therefore, not easily intelligible why both the contracts were filed before the Sales Tax authorities and actually mentioned in the first question that was referred to the Hight Court.

It is, therefore, as well that the relevant clauses of both the contracts should be set out here for properly following the arguments advanced on both sides.
Reference may first be made to the earlier contract dated October 18, 1940. Clause I sets out the specifications, that is to say, the dimensions and quality of the logs to be delivered under the contract which need not be reproduced here. The other material clauses, omitting the unnecessary portions thereof, may now be set out:-
The prices of the logs to be supplied are set out in cl. 6 of the contract as "F.O.R. Ambernath ".
We now pass on to the later contract of March 2, 1945. Clause 1 sets out the specifications of the logs to be supplied under the contract in exactly the same language as in el. I of the earlier contract. The other material clauses, again omitting the unnecessary portions, are as follows:-
It may be mentioned here that Ambernath is a place situate in the erstwhile province of Bombay and outside the Central Provinces.
The prices of the logs to be supplied under the contract are specified as " F.O.R. Ambernath " in cl. 7 which concludes with the following sentence:
Pursuant to the agreement between the respondent and WIMCO, the former loaded diverse quantities of Sawar logs on railway wagons and despatched the same by railway from Chanda or other railway stations in the Central Provinces to Ambernath in the erstwhile province of Bombay and outside the Central Provinces. It is not disputed that on many occasions the representative of WIMCO was present at the railway station when the logs were sorted out and loaded into the wagons. The statement of the case submitted along with the reference under s. 23(1) of the Act is silent on the point as to whether the railway receipts were made out with WIMCO as the consignee; but it is abundantly clear from the order of the Assistant Commissioner, Sales Tax, which is part of the record -and it has not been disputed before us- that " the railway receipt which is a document of title according to s. 2(4) of the Indian Sale of Goods Act is taken in the name of the consignee." The course of dealings between the parties also appears to be that, on arrival of the logs at Ambernath, the consignee buyer WIMCO, paid the railway freight and the logs were inspected and measured by WIMCO's Factory Manager and the prices, calculated at the agreed rates, were paid to the respondent's agent at Bombay. There is no doubt that the price of the logs supplied by the respondent to WIMCO under the agreement and accepted by the latter during the period in question amounted to Rs. 30,067- 9-0. The question for our decision is whether the respondent is liable to pay any sales tax under the Act.
It will be convenient at this stage to refer to the relevant provisions of law applicable to the facts of this case. Section 4 of that Act is the charging section. According to this section safes tax is payable " on all sales effected after the commencement of the Act." " Sale " is defined by s. 2(g) of the Act. At the relevant period, that section, omitting Explanation 1, which is not material for our purpose, ran as follows:-
The Act being a piece of legislation enacted by the legislature of the erstwhile Province of Central Provinces and Berar, its operation is limited to the territories of that province. Therefore, the question arises: Does the sum of Rs. 30,067-9-0 represent the prices of logs sold by the respondent within the Central Provinces ? Sale being the transfer of property in the goods agreed to be sold, we have to enquire if the property in the goods which fetched the sale proceeds on which the sales tax is sought to be levied was transferred in the Central Provinces as contemplated in the main definition or if those goods were actually in the Central Provinces at the time when the contract for sale as defined in the Sale of Goods Act in respect thereof was made as required by Explanation II set out above. This takes us to the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. Section 4 of the Sale of Goods Act is expressed in the words following:-
The transfer of property in the goods as between the seller and buyer is dealt with in Ch. III of the Sale of Goods Act. Section 18 of the Sale of Goods Act runs thus :
Passing over ss. 19 to 22 which (except as to sub-s. (3) of s. 19) apparently apply to contracts for the sale of specific or ascertained goods, we come to s. 23 which provides :-
Reference may next be made to s. 33 and s. 39(1). Section 33 says:-
Section 39(1) runs as follows:-
Keeping the provisions of the above quoted sections of the two Acts in view, we have to decide when and where the property in the logs passed from the respondent to WIMCO. The Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax assessed the respondent to -a tax of Rs. 939-10-0 and imposed on the respondent a penalty of Rs. 100 under s. 25 of the Act for not having submitted its return in contravention of r. 19 of the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Rules. The Assistant Commissioner took the view that the loading of the logs into the wagons at railway stations within the Central Provinces and the taking out of the railway receipts in the name of the consignee, WIMCO, and the delivery of the same to WIMCO, had the effect of putting the latter in pos- session of the goods as laid down in s. 39(1) of the Indian Sale of Goods Act and he accordingly held that the sale of the goods took place at Chanda and other railway stations in the Central Provinces and that the assessee was, consequently, liable to pay the sales tax under the Act. The respondent preferred an appeal to the Sales Tax Commissioner who upheld the Assistant Commissioner's order of assessment as well as of the penalty. He laid greater emphasis on Explanation II to s. 2(g) of the Act as over- riding the provisions of the Indian Sale of Goods Act in respect of the transfer of property in the logs and held that as the' logs were in the Central Provinces at the date when the contract for sale was made, the transfer in them must be deemed to have taken place there under that Explanation. He also agreed with the Assistant Commissioner that the delivery of the logs to the railway company and the sending of the documents of title to WIMCO had, under s. 39(1) of the Sale of Goods Act, the effect of putting WIMCO in possession of the logs.
The respondent preferred what in form appeared to be a second appeal to the Board of Revenue. As, however, there could be no second appeal under s. 22(4) of the Act, the Board treated the memorandum of appeal as an application for revision under sub-s. 5 of s. 22 of the Act read with r. 57. Both the members of the, Board of Revenue came to the same conclusion, namely, that the sales were liable to assessment under the Act, but the reasonings adopted by them were somewhat different. Shri Shrivastava, a member of the Board of Revenue, took the view that as soon as logs answering the description agreed upon were brought to the railhead at Chanda and sorted out and loaded in the wagons in the presence of WIMCO's re- presentatives, there was an implied contract of sale of specific and ascertained goods, as evidenced by the conduct of parties and the property in each consignment passed immediately from the respondent to WIMCO at the railway station in the Central Provinces where such implied contracts were made. The Chairman of the Board of Revenue, however, took the view that the contract of sale was made outside the Central Provinces, namely, in Bombay and that, under the Sale of Goods Act, the property in the logs passed to WIMCO in Ambernath outside the province but that as the logs were in the Central Provinces, either in the form of logs or in the form immediately preceding, namely, trees standing on the land which had been impliedly agreed to be severed from the land before actual sale, Explanation II to s. 2(g) of the Act applied and the sale must, accordingly,
-be deemed to have taken place within the Central Provinces and, must, therefore, be liable to sales tax under the Act. The Board rejected the application but remitted the penalty. On the application of the respondent under s. 23(1) of the Act, the Board of Revenue submitted to the High Court a statement of case raising the following questions:-
In its judgment dated June 29, 1954, the High Court took the view that the sales in question did not take place in the Central Provinces and Berar and consequently were not "
The effect of the answers being to nullify the assessment order, the Commissioner of Sales Tax has come up on appeal before us after obtaining special leave of this Court. The answers to the first two questions have not been questioned before us. The main arguments have centred round the answers to questions 3 and 4. The answer to question 3 turned on the construction placed by the High Court on s. 23 of the Sale of Goods Act. After quoting s. 23, the High Court observed as follows:-
The learned counsel for the department appearing in support of this appeal contends that property in the logs passed from the respondents to WIMCO under s. 23 when sawar logs were brought to the railway station and loaded in the wagon and the railway receipts taken in the name of WIMCO were forwarded to the latter. There was an unconditional appropriation of the goods to the contract by the respondent. There was, according to learned counsel, assent on the part of WIMCO to this appropriation in two ways, namely, (a) expressly given by its representative who was present at the railway station, and (b) impliedly given by WIMCO by having agreed in advance that the goods should be despatched by rail from the stations mentioned in cl. 4 of the agreement, all of which were situate in the Central Provinces.
There is no doubt-and indeed it has been categorically conceded by learned counsel for the department -that the contract was for sale of unascertained goods and consequently the property in them could not, under s. 18, pass unless and until the goods were ascertained. His contention is that logs of the contract quality and description having been unconditionally appropriated by the respondent to the contract without reserving to itself any right of disposal and WIMCO having expressly through its representative or impliedly by the very terms of the contract assented to such appropriation, property in them passed under s. 23 from the respondent to WIMCO at the railway stations within the Central Provinces as soon as the sawar logs were loaded on the wagons and the railway receipts were taken out in the name of WIMCO. It is said that so far as the respondent is concerned it unconditionally appropriated the logs to the contract. Seeing that they were actually accepted by WIMCO on their arrival at Ambernath it is quite clear that the logs were of the contract quality and description. The only question, according to learned counsel for the department therefore, is whether there was assent of WIMCO to such appropriation. It has been found as a fact that WIMCO's representative was not present on all occasions when sawar logs used to be loaded on the railway wagons. There is no evidence that he was actually present when these particular sawar logs, with the sale proceeds of which we are concerned, were put into the wagons. Nor is there an iota of evidence that the representative of WIMCO had any authority to. bind WIMCO by any assent. In view of these difficulties, learned counsel for the department did not press the case of express assent of the representative of WIMCO and concentrated on the case of implied assent. It is quite clear from the language of s. 23 itself, that the appropriation may be by the seller with the assent of the buyer or by the buyer with the assent of the seller, that assent to representation may be express or implied and that it may be given after the appropriation or in advance before such appropriation. Learned counsel for the department lays strong emphasis on the provision of cl. 4 in the contract that the sawar logs should be despatched by rail from certain stations within the Central Provinces and contends that delivery by the seller of sawar logs of the contract quality and description to the railways in terms of the contract without the reservation of any right of disposal has the effect of passing the property therein to WIMCO at the railway stations in the Central Provinces under s. 23 as well as of constituting delivery of them at the railway stations under ss. 33 and 39(1). The argument is prima facie sound unless there be some other provision in the contract to negative this conclusion, e. g., that the logs must be carried to Ambernath and delivered there (See The Badische Anilin and Soda Fabrik v. The Basle Chemical Works, Bindschedler (1)). Learned counsel for the department does not urge that if the matter had to be decided on the terms of the earlier contract dated October 18, 1940, he could properly say that there was nothing in the contract negativing the idea of the passing of property in the logs within the Central Provinces. The cumulative effect of the provisions of el. 2 that the property in the rejected logs would' pass to WIMCO upon the failure of the respondent to remove the same after rejection, of el. 3 that the goods shall be delivered at Ambernath in the presence of WIMCO's Factory Manager and of el. 6 providing that the prices will be " F.O.R. Ambernath "
Therefore, the decision of the High Court cannot be assailed but must be accepted as well-founded in fact and in law. Learned counsel for the department then falls back upon the Argument founded on Explanation- II to s. 2(g) and 'argues, somewhat halfheartedly, that notwithstanding the provisions of the Sale of Goods Act regarding the passing of property in the goods the sale under consideration must be deemed, in the light of that Explanation, to have taken place within the Central Provinces. The question of the constitutional validity of that Explanation was not raised in the High Court and indeed, in view of the decision of this Court in Poppatlal Shah v. State of Madras (1) and other' cases, cannot now be raised and we must proceed on the footing that Explanation 11 did not transgress the legislative competency of the Legislature which enacted the same. It will be noticed that Explanation II can apply only if the goods " in respect of " which the contract of sale is entered into are, at the date of such contract, actually in the Central Provinces. Learned counsel for the department urges that the logs delivered must have been in existence in the Central Provinces either in the shape of ';logs or in the shape of standing timber. There is no evidence that at the date when the agreement for sale was made, the particular logs delivered thereunder were in the Central Provinces in the shape of logs at all. Learned counsel says that, at any rate, they must have been in existence there in the shape of standing timber. Apart from anything else,, the agreement here was riot " in respect of " any standing timber and there was no provision in the agreement as between the respondent and WIMCO for severance of the standing timber before sale under that agreement. In order to attract Explanation II the goods, in respect of which the contract of sale is made, must, at the date of the contract be in existence in the Central Provinces, that is to say, that the goods must at the date of the contract be there in the form in which they are agreed to be sold. There is not an iota of evidence on that point. In our judgment, there is no force in this alternative argument.
The result, therefore, is that this appeal is dismissed with costs.
