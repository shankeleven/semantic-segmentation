WITH Petition No. 31 of 1952.

Harnam Singh, Hardyal Hardy and P. C. Aggarwala, for the appellant in Cr. As. Nos. 100 to 105 of 1954, Petition No. 31 of 52 and Respondent in Cr. As. Nos. 124 to 129 of 1954.	Issue
Imam J. IMAM J.-These appeals are on a certificate granted by the Punjab High Court and they have been heard together as they rise out of a single judgment of the High Court. In Criminal Appeals Nos. 100 to 105 of 1954 Satwant Singh is the appellant and in Criminal Appeals Nos. 124 to 129 of 1954 the State of Punjab is the appellant. Although in these appeals only questions of law have been urged it is necessary to set out briefly some of the facts which led to the prosecution and conviction of Satwant Singh. As a result of the Japanese invasion of Burma in 1942 the Government of Burma and the Allied forces stationed there were compelled to leave that country. In connection with the evacuation from Burma and the defence of that country, the Government of Burma and the army had to execute certain works such as the construction of roads, repairs and construction of bridges, strengthening and repairing of old tracks and converting railway lines into motor roads. Some of these works were executed by the army and some were entrusted to contractors.
After evacuation of Burma its Government was located at Simla. In August, 1942, the Government of Burma advertised inviting claims from contractors who had executed works or had supplied materials in Burma and had not yet been paid. Satwant Singh had worked as a contractor in Burma. He at first submitted a claim for a sum of a little over Rs. 18,000. Later on, he put in further claims the total amount of which ran into several lakhs of rupees. These claims were sent by the Government of Burma to Major Henderson at Jhansi in March and May, 1943, for verification as he was the officer who had knowledge of these matters. This officer certified many of these claims to be correct and sent the papers back to Simla. He did not pass one claim because it was within the knowledge of another officer Mr. Nasa. On the certification of the claims by Henderson, the Finance Department of the Government of Burma sanctioned the same and the Controller of the Military Claims at Kolhapur was directed to pay the amounts sanctioned. On the request of Satwant Singh cheques drawn on the Imperial Bank of India at Lahore were posted to him from Kolhapur and these cheques were encashed at Lahore. In all Satwant Singh was paid Rs. 7,44,865-12-0.
Subsequently, suspicions of the Government of Burma were aroused concerning the many cliams made on it and it was discovered that many of them, including some of those of Satwant Singh, were false. A police investigation followed which revealed that a large number of claims made by various persons including Satwant Singh in respect of works done for the benefit of the army were false. Satwant Singh was arrested on the 12th of April, 1944, at Ambala and was taken to Lahore. He had also submitted a claim in the name of his wife Surjit who was also arrested. Henderson was arrested at lmphal and brought to Lahore for interrogation.
Satwant Singh having expressed a desire to make a confession, his confession was recorded by a First Class Magistrate on the 9th of May, 1944.	Facts
C. K. Daphtary, Solicitor-General of India, Kartar Singh Chawla, T. M. Sen and D. Gupta, for the appellant in Cr. As. Nos. 100 to 105 of 1954 and Petition No. 31 of 1952 and Appellant in Cr. As. Nos. 124 to 129 of 1954.	PetArg
1959. October 28. The judgment of Sinha, C.J., Imam, Wanchoo and Das Gupta, JJ., was delivered by Imam, J. Kapur, J., delivered a separate judgment.
The Special Tribunal imposed sentences of imprisonment ranging from one year to three and a half years in the several trials. In addition, it imposed fines of various amounts. It divided the fines into "ordinary" and "compulsory", the latter by virtue of s. 10 of the Ordinance. In default of payment of the " ordinary " fines it directed the appellant to undergo further imprisonment for certain periods. There was no such direction with respect to the " compulsory " fines. The High Court reduced the sentence of imprisonment to two years in all the trials where such sentence was in excess of that period. The sentences of imprisonment in all the trials were to run concurrently. The High Court maintained the sentence of "
compulsory " fines imposed were invalid in view of the decisions of this Court in the case of Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh and Another v. The State of Vindhya Pradesh (1) and the case of Kedar Nath Bajoria v. The State of West Bengal (2). In the opinion of the High Court, enhancement of sentences of fine would be a method by which the provisions of Art. 20 of the Constitution would be circumvented. (1) [1953] S.C.R. 1189 (2) [1954] SC. R. 30 Satwant Singh has appealed against his conviction and sentence as ordered by the High Court. The State of Punjab has also appealed against the decision of the High Court that the "compulsory " fines imposed were illegal. The State also has made a prayer that the " ordinary "
Accordingly, cheques on the Imperial Bank of India, Lahore Branch, were sent to the appellant by post in Lahore and the appellant encashed them there. In these circumstances, the rule in Ogale Glass Works' case (1) is inapplicable and it must be held that the payment was (1) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 185.
Under, s. 197 no Court shall 'take cognizance of an offence committed by a public servant who is removable from his office by the Governor General-in Council or a Provincial Government, save upon a sanction by one or the other as the case may be, when such offence is committed by him while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty. Henderson was charged with intentionally aiding the appellant in the commission of an offence punishable under s. 420 of the Indian Penal Code by falsely stating as a fact, in his reports that the appellants claims were true and that statement bad been made knowing all the while that the claims in question were false and fraudulent and that he had accordingly committed an offence under s. 420/109, Indian Penal Code. It appears to us to be clear that some offences cannot by their very nature be regarded as having been committed by public servants while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of their official duty. For instance, acceptance of a bribe, an offence punishable under s. 161 of the Indian Penal Code, is one of them and offence of cheating or abetment thereof is another. We have no hesitation in saying that where a public servant commits the offence of cheating or abets another so to cheat, the offence committed by him is not one while he is acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty, as such offences have no necessary connection between them and the performance of the duties of a public servant, the official status furnishing only the occasion or opportunity for the commission of the offences (vide Amrik Singh's case (1) ). The Act of cheating or abetment thereof has no reasonable connection with the discharge of official duty. The act must bear such relation to the duty that the public servant could lay a reasonable but not a pretended or fanciful claim, that he did it in the course of the performance of his duty (vide Matajog Dobey's case (2) ). It was urged, however, that in the present case the act of Henderson in certifying the appellant's claims as true was an official act because it was his duty either to certify or not to certify a claim as true and that if he falsely certified the claim as true he was acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty. It is, however, to be remembered that Henderson was not prosecuted for any offence concerning his act of certification. He was prosecuted for abetting the appellant to cheat. We are firmly of the opinion that Henderson's offence was not one committed by him while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty. Such being the position the provisions of s. 197 of the Code are inapplicable even if Henderson be regarded as a public servant who was removable from his office by the Governor General-in-Council or a Provincial Government. Elaborate arguments were advanced in support of the contention that the provisions of s. 197 of the Code were not inconsistent with the Ordinance and therefore had to be complied with before the Special Tribunal could try Henderson. It was pointed out that under s. 6 of the Ordinance the Special Tribunal was specifically authorized to take cognizance of an offence without the accused being committed to it for trial and sub-s. (2) of that section stated that " Save (1) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 1302.
also was not greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law which had been in force at the time of the commission of the offence, as a fine unlimited in extent could be imposed under the section. It was further pointed out that at least Case No. 58, out of which arose Criminal Appeal No. 112 of 1949 in the High Court, was one to which the provisions of Art. 20 could not apply as the conviction in that case was recorded on the 24th of January, 1949, before the Constitution came into force. Mr. Harnam Singh, on the other hand, drew our attention to s. 63 of the Indian Penal Code and submitted that a sentence of fine could at no time be excessive and therefore the, sentence of fine which could be imposed under s. 420 was not entirely unlimited as it could not be excessive. In considering whether a fine would or would not be excessive various considerations had to be kept in mind including the seriousness of the offence and the means of the accused. Section 63 of the Indian Penal Code expressly states that where no sum is expressed to which a fine may extend the amount of fine to which the offender is liable is unlimited. Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code does not express a sum to which a fine may extend, as some of the sections of the Indian Penal Code do. As the section stands, therefore, the extent of fine which may be imposed by a Court under it is unlimited. Whether a fine imposed in a particular case is excessive would be a question of fact in each case. That consideration, however, is entirely irrelevant in considering whether Art. 20 of the Constitution has been contravened by the provisions of s. 10 of the Ordinance as the extent of fine which can be imposed under s. 420, by law, is unlimited. It cannot be said that s. 10 of the Ordinance in imposing the minimum fine which a court shall inflict on a convicted person was a penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted on that person under the law in force at the time of the commission of the offence, where under such law the extent of fine which could be imposed is unlimited.
In the case of Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh (1), referred to above, this Court held that Art. 20 of the Constitution must be taken to prohibit a conviction or subjection to penalty after the Constitution in respect of ex post facto law whether the same was a pre-Constitutional law or a post- Constitutional law. The prohibition under the Article was not confined to the passing or the validity of the law but extended to the conviction or :the sentence and was based on its character as ex post facto law and therefore fullest effect must be given to the actual words used in the Article. It had been urged in that case that the Vindhya Pradesh Ordinance (No. XLVIII of 1949) was an ex post facto law. This Court, however, held that Ordinance was not ail ex post facto law. The contention that the provisions of Art. 20 of the Constitution had, been contravened was rejected and it was held that the criminal law relating to offences charged against the accused at the time of their commission was substantially the same as obtained at the time of the conviction and sentence under the Indian Penal Code. In Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh's case (1) this Court had not to consider whether an ex post facto law imposing a minimum fine for an offence with respect to which an unlimited fine could be imposed by the law in existence at the time of the commission of the offence contravened the provisions of Art. 20. In Kedar Nath Bajoria's case (2), in addition to the sentence imposed under the ordinary law, the first appellant was fined Rs. 50,000, including the sum of Rs. 47,550 received by him as required by s. 9(1) of the West Bengal Criminal Law (Amendment) Act of 1949. Reference to the decision in Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh's case(1)was made and this Court held that, in any event, the fine to the extent of Rs. 47,550 would be set aside. This Court, however, did not decide whether the total fine imposed was greater than what could be imposed under the law as it was at the commission of the offence. It assumed that Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh's case (1) supported the contention of the first appellant in that case. It is significant that in directing that the appeal would be heard in due course on merits this Court stated that it would be open to the Court in case (1) [1953] S.C.R. 1189.
the conviction was upheld to impose such appropriate fine as it thought fit in addition to the sentence of imprisonment. In the present case even if it be assumed that s. 10 of the Ordinance as an ex post facto law ill that in the matter of penalty a minimum sentence of fine was directed to be imposed by a court whereas at the time that the appellant committed the offence s. 420 contained no such provision, what is prohibited under Art. 20 of the Constitution is the imposition of a penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the commission of the offence. The total sentence of fine-
The same test was repeated in Meads' case (1) and in Phenindra Chandra Neogy v. The King(2). Gill's case(3) and Neogy's case (2) dealt with an offence of bribery under s. 161, but Meads' case(1) was a case of a Courtmartial against an officer who was alleged to have misappropriated money entrusted to him and his defence was that while he was sleeping, the currency notes were burnt by the falling of a candle which was burning in his room. In Hori Rain Singh's case (4) which was approved by the Privy Council and this Court in Amrik Singh's case (5), Vardachariar, J., had accepted the correctness of that track of decision which had held that sanction was necessary when the act complained of attached to the official character of the person doing it. The test was thus stated by Venkatarama Aiyar, J., in Amrik Singh's case (5) at p. 1307:
only the occasion or opportunity for the act, then no sanction would be necessary. There are two other cases reported in the same volume, Ronald Wood Mathams v. State of West Bengal (1) and Shree Kanthiah Ramayya Munipalli v. The State of Bombay(2 )which also relate to sanction under s. 197, Criminal Procter Code. After reviewing all these various authorities Venkatarama Aiyar, J., held at p. 1310:-
In this view of the law we have to decide whether sanction was necessary or not and it is a matter for investigation as to whether an Army officer situated as Henderson was so removable even if there was evidence to show that he was attached to the Indian Army. Secondly, it will have to be decided oil evidence that the act complained of against Henderson, that is, verifying the claim of the appellant which is the basis for the allegation of abetment of the offence of cheating is directly concerned with his official duties or it was done in the discharge of his official duties and was so integrally connected with and attached to his office as to be inseparable from them. There is evidence neither in support of one, nor of the other. In this particular case if it was desired to raise such a question, that should have been done at the earliest moment in the trial Court when the facts could have been established by evidence. This is not the stage for asking the facts to be proved by additional evidence. In the grounds of appeal to the High Court the objection was to the form of the sanction. It also appears that no argument was raised in the High Court that the sanction under s. 270 of the Constitution Act could not take the place of a sanction under s. 197, Criminal Procedure Code, because the scope of the two (1) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 216, (2) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 1177.	Precedent
According to the prosecution, Satwant Singh had committed the offence of cheating punishable under s. 420, Indian Penal Code and Henderson had abetted him in the commission of that offence by falsely certifying Satwant Singh's claims to be true, knowing that they were false and thereby had committed an offence punishable under s. 420/109, Indian Penal Code.
(2) [1955] 2 S.C.R. 925.
as provided in sub-s. (1) the Code of Criminal Procedure,1898 (V of 1898), except the provisions of section 196-A and of Chapter XXXIII, shall so far as they are not inconsistent with this Ordinance, apply to proceedings of a Special Tribunal ; and for the purposes of the said provisions the Special Tribunal shall be deemed to be a Court of Session, trying cases without a jury, and a person conducting a prosecution before a Special Tribunal shall be deemed to be a Public Prosecutor."It was urged that by virtue of this sub-section the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure would be applicable except the provisions of s. 196-A and Chapter XXXIII which had been expressly excluded.If s. 197 of the Code was intended to be excluded, the Ordinance would have said so. Having regard to the view we take that the provisions of s. 197 of the Code do not apply to the facts of the present case as the offence of abetment of cheating by Henderson cannot be regarded as an offence committed by him while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty, it is unnecessary to consider the arguments advanced in this connection. Coming now to the 2nd and 3rd submissions made on behalf of the appellant we have to consider whether the appellant and Henderson could at all be jointly tried, having regard to the fact that they were jointly tried up to a certain stage in some of the trials and to the conclusion of the trial concerning cases Nos. 54,55 and 56. We have already held that no part of the offence of cheating was committed by the appellant outside British India and consequently the provisions of s. 188 of the Code did not apply. The provisions of ss. 179 and 180 are wide enough to enable cognizance to be taken either by a Court where anything was done within the local limits of its jurisdiction or a court where the consequences ensued. Illustration (c) to s. 179 clearly states that if A is put in fear of injury within the local limits of the jurisdiction of Court X,and is thereby induced, within the local limits of the jurisdiction of Court Y, to deliver property to the person who put him in fear, the offence of extortion committed against A may be inquired into or tried either by X or Y. The appellant could have been' therefore tried either at Lahore or at Simla for the offence of cheating as the misrepresentation was at,Simla and the consequence was at Lahore as the Government of Burma was induced by the misrepresentation to deliver property (money) at Lahore. Under s. 180 when an act is an offence by reason of its relation to any other act which is also an offence, a charge of the first-mentioned offence may be inquired into or tried by a Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction either act was done. Illustration (a) to this section states that a charge of abetment may be inquired into or tried either by the Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the abetment was committed or by the Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the offence abetted was committed. The offence of cheating by the appellant could have been tried either at Lahore or at Simla. Consequently, Henderson could also have been tried for the abetment of that offence either at Lahore or at Simla. The case of these accused was allotted to the Special Tribunal at Lahore and would have normally been tried there but for the partition of India. The trial under the authority of law, was concluded at Simla. There seems, therefore, to have been no illegality committed in trying the appellant and Henderson together at Simla. The other line of argument in support of the objection that the appellant and Henderson could not be tried together was based on the provisions of ss. 233 and 239 of the Code. It was pointed out that under the provisions of s. 233 of the Code for every distinct offence of which any person is accused there shall be a separate charge and every such charge shall be tried separately except in the cases mentioned in ss. 234, 235, 236 and 239. Unless, therefore, the joinder of trial of the appellant and Henderson was permitted under s. 239 of the Code they could not be tried together. It was: urged that in construing s. 239 of the Code it was not permissible to take into consideration the provisions of s. 234. The only provision by which a person accused of an offence and a person accused of abetment of that offence can be tried together in a single trial is under s. 239(b) which permits persons accused of an offence and persons accused of abetment to be charged and tried together. Under the terms of these provisions any number of persons accused of commuting a single offence could be tried together with any number of persons who had abetted that offence. But cl. (b) did not permit the trial of persons accused of several offences and persons accused of abetment of those offences in one trial and to try a person accused of three offences along with a person accused of abetment of those offences would be contrary to the provisions of cl. (b). If the provisions of s. 239(b) and s. 234 were combined the result would be to create another exception to be added to the exceptions stated in s. 233 of the Code. No Court had any authority to create a' new exception to s. 233. S. 239 being an exception to s. 233 its provisions had to be construed strictly. The plain words of s. 239(b) make it quite clear that persons who had committed a single offence and those who abetted it only could be tried together. Since the appellant is said to have committed three offences of cheating and Henderson three offences of abetment thereof, the provisions of s. 239(b) did not apply and their trial together was vitiated. It was further pointed out that if there had been misjoinder of trial in the present case it could not reasonably be said that the appellant had not been prejudiced. If the appellant bad been tried apart from Henderson. Henderson's confession and all the evidence against him would have been excluded at the trial of the appellant. As the result of Henderson and the appellant being tried together all the evidence against Henderson and his confession must have necessarily adversely affected the case of the appellant. On the other hand, the Solicitor-General submitted that the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure must be construed as they stand and reference to decided cases may be made to assist the court in the matter of construction if necessary. The Code itself nowhere stated that ss. 234 and 239 of the Code 'were mutually exclusive. The entire scheme of joinder of charges and joinder of persons in a single trial has been set out in the Code. Although s. 233 of the Code is clear enough, it has expressly expected from the application of its provisions ss. 234, 235, 236 and 239. Sections 234, 235, 236 and 239 are permissive sections. They are not compelling sections. That is to say, although these sections permit joinder of charges and joinder of persons a Court may well consider it desirable in the interest of justice and having regard to the circumstances of a particular case that the charges framed should be split up and separate trials should take place in respect of them and the accused be tried separately. It was to avoid multiplicity of trials, harassment to the accused and waste of time that the permissive ss. 234, 235, 236 and 239 enable a court, within their terms, to join charges and persons in a single trial. Section 239 permitted joinder of charges and persons in a single trial in cases covered by cls. (a) to (g). These clauses permitted the joinder of persons as accused in one trial and they contemplated the various circumstances in which such persons could be tried together. Joinder of several persons in one trial necessarily involves the framing of more than one charge. If the joinder of charges was within the terms of the section, then the provisions of s. 233 had no application. Although in cl.
(b) of the section the words used are "persons accused of an offence and persons accused of abetment, or of an attempt to commit such offence ", a reasonable construction of these words could not lead to the conclusion that the words " an offence " meant a single offence because under s. 13 of the General Clauses Act (Central Act X of 1897) words in the singular shall include the plural and vice versa. Under cl.
(b), therefore, persons accused of several offences and persons accused of abetment thereof could be tried together in a single trial. The concluding words of s. 239 " and the provisions contained in the former part of this Chapter shall, so far as it may be, apply to all such charges "
Leaving cl. (b) out for the moment the other clauses of the section clearly contemplate the framing of more than one charge against accused persons when tried together. Under cl. (a) persons accused of the same offence committed in the course of the same transaction can be tried together. Under cl. (c) persons accused of more than one offence of the same kind within the meaning of s. 234 committed by them jointly within the period of 12 months can also be tried together. Under cl. (d) persons accused of different offences committed in the course of the same transaction can be tried together. Similar is the position in cases mentioned in cls. (e), (f) and It is clear, therefore, that the general rule that for every distinct offence of which any person is accused there shall be a separate charge, and every such charge shall be tried separately has no application to these clauses. Indeed s. 233 contemplated that and expressly excluded the application of its provisions to s. 239. The entire tenor of the provisions of s. 239 indicates that several persons could be tried together for several offences committed in the circumstances mentioned therein. There is no apparent reason why cl. (b) should be construed in the way suggested by Mr. Harnam Singh, according to whom, in one trial any number of persons could be tried for a single offence along with any number of persons accused of abetment of that offence. The argument was based on the words " an offence in that clause and the suggestion was that these words meant a single offence. Having regard to the providers of s. 13 of the General Clauses Act, the singular includes the plural and it would not be straining the language of the clause if the same was construed also to mean that persons accused of several offences and persons accused of abetment thereof could be tried together at one trial. So construed framing of three charges under s. 420, Indian Penal Code, against Satwant Singh and three charges of abetment against Henderson in the same trial did not infringe the provisions of cl. (b). Furthermore, the concluding words of the section make it clear that the provisions contained in the former part of Chapter XIX, i.e., previous to s. 239 as a far as may be shall apply to all charges framed at the trial. It was suggested that the words " the former part of this Chapter "	Section

Even in regard to cases of misappropriation, this Court in Amrik Singh's case (5) was of the opinion that if the act complained of is so integrally connected with the duties attaching to the office as to be inseparable from them, then sanction would be necessary, but if there is no connection between them and the performance of those duties, the official status furnishing (1) 75 I.A. 185.

provisions is different. But as I have said above the evidence to support the plea under s. 197 and to establish the requisite nexus between the act done by Henderson and the scope and extent of his duties is lacking and therefore the applicability of s. 197 to the facts of the present case cannot be held to have been proved.
In my opinion the foundation has not been laid for holding that sanction under s. 197 was necessary in the instant case. I therefore agree that the appeals be dismissed. By court.-The petitioner's Criminal Appeals Nos. 100 to 105 of 1954 having been dismissed and the conviction of the petitioner having been upheld, this petition is dismissed.	Conclusion
CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeals Nos. 100 to 105 and 124 to 129 of 1954.

1959. October 28. The judgment of Sinha, C.J., Imam, Wanchoo and Das Gupta, JJ., was delivered by Imam, J. Kapur, J., delivered a separate judgment.
Imam J. IMAM J.-These appeals are on a certificate granted by the Punjab High Court and they have been heard together as they rise out of a single judgment of the High Court. In Criminal Appeals Nos. 100 to 105 of 1954 Satwant Singh is the appellant and in Criminal Appeals Nos. 124 to 129 of 1954 the State of Punjab is the appellant. Although in these appeals only questions of law have been urged it is necessary to set out briefly some of the facts which led to the prosecution and conviction of Satwant Singh. As a result of the Japanese invasion of Burma in 1942 the Government of Burma and the Allied forces stationed there were compelled to leave that country. In connection with the evacuation from Burma and the defence of that country, the Government of Burma and the army had to execute certain works such as the construction of roads, repairs and construction of bridges, strengthening and repairing of old tracks and converting railway lines into motor roads. Some of these works were executed by the army and some were entrusted to contractors.
After evacuation of Burma its Government was located at Simla. In August, 1942, the Government of Burma advertised inviting claims from contractors who had executed works or had supplied materials in Burma and had not yet been paid. Satwant Singh had worked as a contractor in Burma. He at first submitted a claim for a sum of a little over Rs. 18,000. Later on, he put in further claims the total amount of which ran into several lakhs of rupees. These claims were sent by the Government of Burma to Major Henderson at Jhansi in March and May, 1943, for verification as he was the officer who had knowledge of these matters. This officer certified many of these claims to be correct and sent the papers back to Simla. He did not pass one claim because it was within the knowledge of another officer Mr. Nasa. On the certification of the claims by Henderson, the Finance Department of the Government of Burma sanctioned the same and the Controller of the Military Claims at Kolhapur was directed to pay the amounts sanctioned. On the request of Satwant Singh cheques drawn on the Imperial Bank of India at Lahore were posted to him from Kolhapur and these cheques were encashed at Lahore. In all Satwant Singh was paid Rs. 7,44,865-12-0.
Subsequently, suspicions of the Government of Burma were aroused concerning the many cliams made on it and it was discovered that many of them, including some of those of Satwant Singh, were false. A police investigation followed which revealed that a large number of claims made by various persons including Satwant Singh in respect of works done for the benefit of the army were false. Satwant Singh was arrested on the 12th of April, 1944, at Ambala and was taken to Lahore. He had also submitted a claim in the name of his wife Surjit who was also arrested. Henderson was arrested at lmphal and brought to Lahore for interrogation.
According to the prosecution, Satwant Singh had committed the offence of cheating punishable under s. 420, Indian Penal Code and Henderson had abetted him in the commission of that offence by falsely certifying Satwant Singh's claims to be true, knowing that they were false and thereby had committed an offence punishable under s. 420/109, Indian Penal Code.
Satwant Singh having expressed a desire to make a confession, his confession was recorded by a First Class Magistrate on the 9th of May, 1944.
There being many cases of acceptance of bribe and criminal breach of trust by public servants and cheating of Government by certain persons and cases similar to that of Satwant Singh, Ordinance No. XXIX of 1943, hereinafter referred to as the Ordinance, for trial of such cases was promulgated by the Governor General of India in 1943. Subsequently, this Ordinance was amended by Ordinance XII of 1945. By virtue of a notification issued under the Ordinance as amended the case of Satwant Singh was allotted to the Third Special Tribunal at Lahore for trial with Henderson as his co-accused. After the partition, the trial by the Special Tribunal took place at Simla. Henderson had absconded to England and extradition proceedings had to be taken against him under the Fugitive Offender's Act of 1881. He was brought before the Special Tribunal in December, 1949. In the meantime, Satwant Singh's case was separated and the trial against him alone continued. On Henderson's return, the trial once again became a joint trial. Henderson applied for examination of certain witnesses on commission in England. His prayer was granted. Satwant Singh fearing that the trial of the cases against him would be delayed, requested that his cases be separated from the cases against Henderson. This prayer was allowed and his trials proceeded against him as the sole accused except in the trial of Cases Nos. 54, 55 and 56 in which Henderson was a coaccused with him.
The Special Tribunal imposed sentences of imprisonment ranging from one year to three and a half years in the several trials. In addition, it imposed fines of various amounts. It divided the fines into "ordinary" and "compulsory", the latter by virtue of s. 10 of the Ordinance. In default of payment of the " ordinary " fines it directed the appellant to undergo further imprisonment for certain periods. There was no such direction with respect to the " compulsory " fines. The High Court reduced the sentence of imprisonment to two years in all the trials where such sentence was in excess of that period. The sentences of imprisonment in all the trials were to run concurrently. The High Court maintained the sentence of "
compulsory " fines imposed were invalid in view of the decisions of this Court in the case of Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh and Another v. The State of Vindhya Pradesh (1) and the case of Kedar Nath Bajoria v. The State of West Bengal (2). In the opinion of the High Court, enhancement of sentences of fine would be a method by which the provisions of Art. 20 of the Constitution would be circumvented. (1) [1953] S.C.R. 1189 (2) [1954] SC. R. 30 Satwant Singh has appealed against his conviction and sentence as ordered by the High Court. The State of Punjab has also appealed against the decision of the High Court that the "compulsory " fines imposed were illegal. The State also has made a prayer that the " ordinary "
Accordingly, cheques on the Imperial Bank of India, Lahore Branch, were sent to the appellant by post in Lahore and the appellant encashed them there. In these circumstances, the rule in Ogale Glass Works' case (1) is inapplicable and it must be held that the payment was (1) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 185.
(2) [1959] 36 I.T.R. 488, made to the appellant at Lahore and not at Kolhapur where the cheques had been posted. Furthermore, what may be relevant for consideration as to the place of payment for the purpose of the Income Tax Act may not necessarily be relevant for the purposes of a criminal case in which the Courts have to ascertain where the offence of cheating was committed. It seems to us, on the facts established in this case, that no part of the offence of cheating was committed by the appellant outside British India. His false repre- sentation to the Government of Burma that money was due to him was at a place in British India which induced that Government to order payment of his claims. In fact, he was paid at Lahore at his own request by means of cheques on the Branch of the Imperial Bank of India at Lahore. The delivery of the property of the Government of Burma, namely, the money, was made at Lahore, a place in British India, and we cannot regard, in the circumstances of the present case, the posting of the cheques at Kolhapur either as delivery of property to the appellant at Kolhapur or payment of his claims at Kolhapur. The entire argument founded on the provisions of s. 188 of the Code therefore, fails. As the offence committed by the appellant was not at a place beyond British India, there was no need for the existence of a certificate of a Political Agent or, in the absence of such a person, a sanction of the Provincial Government. Coming to the question whether the absence of a sanction under s. 197 of the Code vitiated the trial, it -has to be established that Henderson was a -public servant removable by the Governor General-in-Councll or the Provincial Government. As no objection had been taken before the Special Tribunal by the appellant in this respect it was urged by the Solicitor General that the prosecution had no opportunity of establishing that Henderson, though a public servant, was a person not removable by the Governor General- in-Council or the Provincial Government. On the other hand, it was urged by Mr. Harnam Singh that in the High Court the objection had been taken but it had been overruled on the ground that there was in fact a sanction in existence. The High Court was under a misapprehension.The sanction which was in existence was under s. 270 of the Government of India Act, 1935, which is given by the Governor General himself, where as the sanction under s. 197 of the Code is given by the Governor General-in-Council. The sanction under s. 270 of the Government of India Act, 1935, could not therefore be treated as a sanction under s. 197 of the Code. -In the High Court, apparently, no submission was made that Henderson was not a public servant removable by the Governor General-in- Council or the Provincial Government. If it is being urged now that Henderson was not such a person then the appellant should be given an opportunity to show that he was a public servant so removable. It is unnecessary to deal with these submissions, which relate to a question of fact, in view of our conclusion as mentioned below with respect to the applicability of the provisions of s. 197 of the Code in the present case.
Under, s. 197 no Court shall 'take cognizance of an offence committed by a public servant who is removable from his office by the Governor General-in Council or a Provincial Government, save upon a sanction by one or the other as the case may be, when such offence is committed by him while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty. Henderson was charged with intentionally aiding the appellant in the commission of an offence punishable under s. 420 of the Indian Penal Code by falsely stating as a fact, in his reports that the appellants claims were true and that statement bad been made knowing all the while that the claims in question were false and fraudulent and that he had accordingly committed an offence under s. 420/109, Indian Penal Code. It appears to us to be clear that some offences cannot by their very nature be regarded as having been committed by public servants while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of their official duty. For instance, acceptance of a bribe, an offence punishable under s. 161 of the Indian Penal Code, is one of them and offence of cheating or abetment thereof is another. We have no hesitation in saying that where a public servant commits the offence of cheating or abets another so to cheat, the offence committed by him is not one while he is acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty, as such offences have no necessary connection between them and the performance of the duties of a public servant, the official status furnishing only the occasion or opportunity for the commission of the offences (vide Amrik Singh's case (1) ). The Act of cheating or abetment thereof has no reasonable connection with the discharge of official duty. The act must bear such relation to the duty that the public servant could lay a reasonable but not a pretended or fanciful claim, that he did it in the course of the performance of his duty (vide Matajog Dobey's case (2) ). It was urged, however, that in the present case the act of Henderson in certifying the appellant's claims as true was an official act because it was his duty either to certify or not to certify a claim as true and that if he falsely certified the claim as true he was acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty. It is, however, to be remembered that Henderson was not prosecuted for any offence concerning his act of certification. He was prosecuted for abetting the appellant to cheat. We are firmly of the opinion that Henderson's offence was not one committed by him while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty. Such being the position the provisions of s. 197 of the Code are inapplicable even if Henderson be regarded as a public servant who was removable from his office by the Governor General-in-Council or a Provincial Government. Elaborate arguments were advanced in support of the contention that the provisions of s. 197 of the Code were not inconsistent with the Ordinance and therefore had to be complied with before the Special Tribunal could try Henderson. It was pointed out that under s. 6 of the Ordinance the Special Tribunal was specifically authorized to take cognizance of an offence without the accused being committed to it for trial and sub-s. (2) of that section stated that " Save (1) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 1302.
(2) [1955] 2 S.C.R. 925.
as provided in sub-s. (1) the Code of Criminal Procedure,1898 (V of 1898), except the provisions of section 196-A and of Chapter XXXIII, shall so far as they are not inconsistent with this Ordinance, apply to proceedings of a Special Tribunal ; and for the purposes of the said provisions the Special Tribunal shall be deemed to be a Court of Session, trying cases without a jury, and a person conducting a prosecution before a Special Tribunal shall be deemed to be a Public Prosecutor."It was urged that by virtue of this sub-section the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure would be applicable except the provisions of s. 196-A and Chapter XXXIII which had been expressly excluded.If s. 197 of the Code was intended to be excluded, the Ordinance would have said so. Having regard to the view we take that the provisions of s. 197 of the Code do not apply to the facts of the present case as the offence of abetment of cheating by Henderson cannot be regarded as an offence committed by him while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty, it is unnecessary to consider the arguments advanced in this connection. Coming now to the 2nd and 3rd submissions made on behalf of the appellant we have to consider whether the appellant and Henderson could at all be jointly tried, having regard to the fact that they were jointly tried up to a certain stage in some of the trials and to the conclusion of the trial concerning cases Nos. 54,55 and 56. We have already held that no part of the offence of cheating was committed by the appellant outside British India and consequently the provisions of s. 188 of the Code did not apply. The provisions of ss. 179 and 180 are wide enough to enable cognizance to be taken either by a Court where anything was done within the local limits of its jurisdiction or a court where the consequences ensued. Illustration (c) to s. 179 clearly states that if A is put in fear of injury within the local limits of the jurisdiction of Court X,and is thereby induced, within the local limits of the jurisdiction of Court Y, to deliver property to the person who put him in fear, the offence of extortion committed against A may be inquired into or tried either by X or Y. The appellant could have been' therefore tried either at Lahore or at Simla for the offence of cheating as the misrepresentation was at,Simla and the consequence was at Lahore as the Government of Burma was induced by the misrepresentation to deliver property (money) at Lahore. Under s. 180 when an act is an offence by reason of its relation to any other act which is also an offence, a charge of the first-mentioned offence may be inquired into or tried by a Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction either act was done. Illustration (a) to this section states that a charge of abetment may be inquired into or tried either by the Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the abetment was committed or by the Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the offence abetted was committed. The offence of cheating by the appellant could have been tried either at Lahore or at Simla. Consequently, Henderson could also have been tried for the abetment of that offence either at Lahore or at Simla. The case of these accused was allotted to the Special Tribunal at Lahore and would have normally been tried there but for the partition of India. The trial under the authority of law, was concluded at Simla. There seems, therefore, to have been no illegality committed in trying the appellant and Henderson together at Simla. The other line of argument in support of the objection that the appellant and Henderson could not be tried together was based on the provisions of ss. 233 and 239 of the Code. It was pointed out that under the provisions of s. 233 of the Code for every distinct offence of which any person is accused there shall be a separate charge and every such charge shall be tried separately except in the cases mentioned in ss. 234, 235, 236 and 239. Unless, therefore, the joinder of trial of the appellant and Henderson was permitted under s. 239 of the Code they could not be tried together. It was: urged that in construing s. 239 of the Code it was not permissible to take into consideration the provisions of s. 234. The only provision by which a person accused of an offence and a person accused of abetment of that offence can be tried together in a single trial is under s. 239(b) which permits persons accused of an offence and persons accused of abetment to be charged and tried together. Under the terms of these provisions any number of persons accused of commuting a single offence could be tried together with any number of persons who had abetted that offence. But cl. (b) did not permit the trial of persons accused of several offences and persons accused of abetment of those offences in one trial and to try a person accused of three offences along with a person accused of abetment of those offences would be contrary to the provisions of cl. (b). If the provisions of s. 239(b) and s. 234 were combined the result would be to create another exception to be added to the exceptions stated in s. 233 of the Code. No Court had any authority to create a' new exception to s. 233. S. 239 being an exception to s. 233 its provisions had to be construed strictly. The plain words of s. 239(b) make it quite clear that persons who had committed a single offence and those who abetted it only could be tried together. Since the appellant is said to have committed three offences of cheating and Henderson three offences of abetment thereof, the provisions of s. 239(b) did not apply and their trial together was vitiated. It was further pointed out that if there had been misjoinder of trial in the present case it could not reasonably be said that the appellant had not been prejudiced. If the appellant bad been tried apart from Henderson. Henderson's confession and all the evidence against him would have been excluded at the trial of the appellant. As the result of Henderson and the appellant being tried together all the evidence against Henderson and his confession must have necessarily adversely affected the case of the appellant. On the other hand, the Solicitor-General submitted that the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure must be construed as they stand and reference to decided cases may be made to assist the court in the matter of construction if necessary. The Code itself nowhere stated that ss. 234 and 239 of the Code 'were mutually exclusive. The entire scheme of joinder of charges and joinder of persons in a single trial has been set out in the Code. Although s. 233 of the Code is clear enough, it has expressly expected from the application of its provisions ss. 234, 235, 236 and 239. Sections 234, 235, 236 and 239 are permissive sections. They are not compelling sections. That is to say, although these sections permit joinder of charges and joinder of persons a Court may well consider it desirable in the interest of justice and having regard to the circumstances of a particular case that the charges framed should be split up and separate trials should take place in respect of them and the accused be tried separately. It was to avoid multiplicity of trials, harassment to the accused and waste of time that the permissive ss. 234, 235, 236 and 239 enable a court, within their terms, to join charges and persons in a single trial. Section 239 permitted joinder of charges and persons in a single trial in cases covered by cls. (a) to (g). These clauses permitted the joinder of persons as accused in one trial and they contemplated the various circumstances in which such persons could be tried together. Joinder of several persons in one trial necessarily involves the framing of more than one charge. If the joinder of charges was within the terms of the section, then the provisions of s. 233 had no application. Although in cl.
(b) of the section the words used are "persons accused of an offence and persons accused of abetment, or of an attempt to commit such offence ", a reasonable construction of these words could not lead to the conclusion that the words " an offence " meant a single offence because under s. 13 of the General Clauses Act (Central Act X of 1897) words in the singular shall include the plural and vice versa. Under cl.
(b), therefore, persons accused of several offences and persons accused of abetment thereof could be tried together in a single trial. The concluding words of s. 239 " and the provisions contained in the former part of this Chapter shall, so far as it may be, apply to all such charges "
Leaving cl. (b) out for the moment the other clauses of the section clearly contemplate the framing of more than one charge against accused persons when tried together. Under cl. (a) persons accused of the same offence committed in the course of the same transaction can be tried together. Under cl. (c) persons accused of more than one offence of the same kind within the meaning of s. 234 committed by them jointly within the period of 12 months can also be tried together. Under cl. (d) persons accused of different offences committed in the course of the same transaction can be tried together. Similar is the position in cases mentioned in cls. (e), (f) and It is clear, therefore, that the general rule that for every distinct offence of which any person is accused there shall be a separate charge, and every such charge shall be tried separately has no application to these clauses. Indeed s. 233 contemplated that and expressly excluded the application of its provisions to s. 239. The entire tenor of the provisions of s. 239 indicates that several persons could be tried together for several offences committed in the circumstances mentioned therein. There is no apparent reason why cl. (b) should be construed in the way suggested by Mr. Harnam Singh, according to whom, in one trial any number of persons could be tried for a single offence along with any number of persons accused of abetment of that offence. The argument was based on the words " an offence in that clause and the suggestion was that these words meant a single offence. Having regard to the providers of s. 13 of the General Clauses Act, the singular includes the plural and it would not be straining the language of the clause if the same was construed also to mean that persons accused of several offences and persons accused of abetment thereof could be tried together at one trial. So construed framing of three charges under s. 420, Indian Penal Code, against Satwant Singh and three charges of abetment against Henderson in the same trial did not infringe the provisions of cl. (b). Furthermore, the concluding words of the section make it clear that the provisions contained in the former part of Chapter XIX, i.e., previous to s. 239 as a far as may be shall apply to all charges framed at the trial. It was suggested that the words " the former part of this Chapter "
also was not greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law which had been in force at the time of the commission of the offence, as a fine unlimited in extent could be imposed under the section. It was further pointed out that at least Case No. 58, out of which arose Criminal Appeal No. 112 of 1949 in the High Court, was one to which the provisions of Art. 20 could not apply as the conviction in that case was recorded on the 24th of January, 1949, before the Constitution came into force. Mr. Harnam Singh, on the other hand, drew our attention to s. 63 of the Indian Penal Code and submitted that a sentence of fine could at no time be excessive and therefore the, sentence of fine which could be imposed under s. 420 was not entirely unlimited as it could not be excessive. In considering whether a fine would or would not be excessive various considerations had to be kept in mind including the seriousness of the offence and the means of the accused. Section 63 of the Indian Penal Code expressly states that where no sum is expressed to which a fine may extend the amount of fine to which the offender is liable is unlimited. Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code does not express a sum to which a fine may extend, as some of the sections of the Indian Penal Code do. As the section stands, therefore, the extent of fine which may be imposed by a Court under it is unlimited. Whether a fine imposed in a particular case is excessive would be a question of fact in each case. That consideration, however, is entirely irrelevant in considering whether Art. 20 of the Constitution has been contravened by the provisions of s. 10 of the Ordinance as the extent of fine which can be imposed under s. 420, by law, is unlimited. It cannot be said that s. 10 of the Ordinance in imposing the minimum fine which a court shall inflict on a convicted person was a penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted on that person under the law in force at the time of the commission of the offence, where under such law the extent of fine which could be imposed is unlimited.
In the case of Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh (1), referred to above, this Court held that Art. 20 of the Constitution must be taken to prohibit a conviction or subjection to penalty after the Constitution in respect of ex post facto law whether the same was a pre-Constitutional law or a post- Constitutional law. The prohibition under the Article was not confined to the passing or the validity of the law but extended to the conviction or :the sentence and was based on its character as ex post facto law and therefore fullest effect must be given to the actual words used in the Article. It had been urged in that case that the Vindhya Pradesh Ordinance (No. XLVIII of 1949) was an ex post facto law. This Court, however, held that Ordinance was not ail ex post facto law. The contention that the provisions of Art. 20 of the Constitution had, been contravened was rejected and it was held that the criminal law relating to offences charged against the accused at the time of their commission was substantially the same as obtained at the time of the conviction and sentence under the Indian Penal Code. In Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh's case (1) this Court had not to consider whether an ex post facto law imposing a minimum fine for an offence with respect to which an unlimited fine could be imposed by the law in existence at the time of the commission of the offence contravened the provisions of Art. 20. In Kedar Nath Bajoria's case (2), in addition to the sentence imposed under the ordinary law, the first appellant was fined Rs. 50,000, including the sum of Rs. 47,550 received by him as required by s. 9(1) of the West Bengal Criminal Law (Amendment) Act of 1949. Reference to the decision in Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh's case(1)was made and this Court held that, in any event, the fine to the extent of Rs. 47,550 would be set aside. This Court, however, did not decide whether the total fine imposed was greater than what could be imposed under the law as it was at the commission of the offence. It assumed that Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh's case (1) supported the contention of the first appellant in that case. It is significant that in directing that the appeal would be heard in due course on merits this Court stated that it would be open to the Court in case (1) [1953] S.C.R. 1189.
(2) [1954] S.C.R. 30.
the conviction was upheld to impose such appropriate fine as it thought fit in addition to the sentence of imprisonment. In the present case even if it be assumed that s. 10 of the Ordinance as an ex post facto law ill that in the matter of penalty a minimum sentence of fine was directed to be imposed by a court whereas at the time that the appellant committed the offence s. 420 contained no such provision, what is prohibited under Art. 20 of the Constitution is the imposition of a penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the commission of the offence. The total sentence of fine-
The same test was repeated in Meads' case (1) and in Phenindra Chandra Neogy v. The King(2). Gill's case(3) and Neogy's case (2) dealt with an offence of bribery under s. 161, but Meads' case(1) was a case of a Courtmartial against an officer who was alleged to have misappropriated money entrusted to him and his defence was that while he was sleeping, the currency notes were burnt by the falling of a candle which was burning in his room. In Hori Rain Singh's case (4) which was approved by the Privy Council and this Court in Amrik Singh's case (5), Vardachariar, J., had accepted the correctness of that track of decision which had held that sanction was necessary when the act complained of attached to the official character of the person doing it. The test was thus stated by Venkatarama Aiyar, J., in Amrik Singh's case (5) at p. 1307:
Even in regard to cases of misappropriation, this Court in Amrik Singh's case (5) was of the opinion that if the act complained of is so integrally connected with the duties attaching to the office as to be inseparable from them, then sanction would be necessary, but if there is no connection between them and the performance of those duties, the official status furnishing (1) 75 I.A. 185. (3) 75 I. A. 41.
(2) 76 I.A. 10. (4) [1939] F.C.R. 159.
(5) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 1302.
only the occasion or opportunity for the act, then no sanction would be necessary. There are two other cases reported in the same volume, Ronald Wood Mathams v. State of West Bengal (1) and Shree Kanthiah Ramayya Munipalli v. The State of Bombay(2 )which also relate to sanction under s. 197, Criminal Procter Code. After reviewing all these various authorities Venkatarama Aiyar, J., held at p. 1310:-
In this view of the law we have to decide whether sanction was necessary or not and it is a matter for investigation as to whether an Army officer situated as Henderson was so removable even if there was evidence to show that he was attached to the Indian Army. Secondly, it will have to be decided oil evidence that the act complained of against Henderson, that is, verifying the claim of the appellant which is the basis for the allegation of abetment of the offence of cheating is directly concerned with his official duties or it was done in the discharge of his official duties and was so integrally connected with and attached to his office as to be inseparable from them. There is evidence neither in support of one, nor of the other. In this particular case if it was desired to raise such a question, that should have been done at the earliest moment in the trial Court when the facts could have been established by evidence. This is not the stage for asking the facts to be proved by additional evidence. In the grounds of appeal to the High Court the objection was to the form of the sanction. It also appears that no argument was raised in the High Court that the sanction under s. 270 of the Constitution Act could not take the place of a sanction under s. 197, Criminal Procedure Code, because the scope of the two (1) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 216, (2) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 1177.
provisions is different. But as I have said above the evidence to support the plea under s. 197 and to establish the requisite nexus between the act done by Henderson and the scope and extent of his duties is lacking and therefore the applicability of s. 197 to the facts of the present case cannot be held to have been proved.
In my opinion the foundation has not been laid for holding that sanction under s. 197 was necessary in the instant case. I therefore agree that the appeals be dismissed. By court.-The petitioner's Criminal Appeals Nos. 100 to 105 of 1954 having been dismissed and the conviction of the petitioner having been upheld, this petition is dismissed.	Total Judgement
