Ranchhoddas Atmaram vs The Union Of India on 3 February, 1961	Case Title
ORIGINAL JURISDICTION 1. Petition No. 300 of 1960. Petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution of India for enforcement of Fundamental Rights and Criminal Appeal No. 107 of 1958, Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated April 5, 1957, of the Bombay High Court in Criminal Revision Application No. 1100 of 1956.
C. K. Daphtary, Solicitor-General of India, H. B. Khanna, Y. S. Parmar and G. Gupta, for respondents (In Petn. No. 300 of 1960).
N. C. Chatterjee and B. L. Aggarwal, for the appellant. H. R. Khanna and R. H. Dhebar, for respondents (In Cr. A. No. 107 of 1958.) 1961. February 3. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SARKAR, J.-These two matters have been heard together as they raise a common question. One of these matters is a petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution and the other, an appeal from a judgment of the High Court at Bombay. The petitioner and the appellant were found by the Customs authorities in proceedings under the Sea Customs Act, 1878, to have imported goods in breach of s. 19 of that Act. The petitioner had without authority imported gold of the value of Rs. 25,000/and the appellant, steel pipes 'of the value of Rs. 1,28,182/-. The Customs authorities by independent orders, imposed a penalty of Rs. 5,000/- on the petitioner and of Rs. 25,630/- on the appellant for these offences, under item 8 of the schedule to s. 167 of the Act. The Customs authorities further confiscated the petitioner's gold under the same provision. There was no order of confiscation of the steel pipes for reasons to which it is unnecessary to refer.	Issue
of the Constitution challenging the validity of the penalties levied. The main part of the argument of the learned counsel for the petitioner was based on the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, 1947, and raised questions which do not concern us in the present cases.. It appears however that it was also contended that item 8 in s. 167 offended Art. 14 of the Constitution, a point which again does not arise in the cases in hand. That contention was dealt with in the following words at p. 1158:	PetArg
Porus A. Mehta, S. J. Sorabjee, S. N. Andley, J. B. Dadachanji, Rameshwar Nath and P. L. Vohra, for the petitioners.
The appeal is against an order the result of which was to direct realisation of the penalty imposed on the appellant, by execution of a distress warrant. The petition challenges the validity of the order imposing the pecuniary penalty. Neither the petitioner nor the appellant, however, questions the decisions of the Customs authorities that they had been guilty of breach of a. 19 or that penalties could be imposed on them under item 8 in a. 167. The petitioner does not, further, challenge the order confiscating the gold. The only contention of the petitioner and the appellant is that the orders of the Customs authorities are invalid as they impose penalties in excess of Rs. 1,000/-. They contend that the maximum penalty that can be imposed under item 8 in s. 167 is Rs. 1,000/-. This contention is based on two grounds. First it is said that, it has been so held by this Court. Then it is said that, in any case, on a proper construction, item 8 in s. 167 does not premit the imposition of a penalty in excess of Rs. 1,000/- First, as to the decisions of this Court, we were referred to three. The earliest is Maqbool Hussain v. The State of Bombay (1). That was a case in which the question was whether a person on whom a penalty of confiscation of goods had been imposed under item 8 in s. 167, could later be prosecuted on the same facts for an offence under s. 23 of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947, in view of the provisions of Art. 20(2) of the Constitution against, what has been called, double jeopardy. It was held that Art. 20(2) was no bar to the prosecution under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act for, the authority under the Sea Customs Act imposing the penalty under item 8 in s., 167 was not a judicial tribunal and the proceeding resulting in the imposition of the penalty of confiscation was, therefore, not a prosecution. No question arose in that case as to the maximum penalty that could be imposed under item 8 in s,
167. While discussing whether a Customs authority exercising the power to order confiscation and levy a penalty under s. 167 formed a judicial tribunal, this Court observed at p. 742:
The second case is Babulal Amthalal Mehta v. The Collector of Customs (1). The only question that arose there was whether s. 178A of the Sea Customs Act, which placed on the person from whose possession any goods mentioned in the section and reasonably believed to have been smuggled were seized, the burden of proving that they were not so, was void as offending Art. 14 of the Constitution. In discussing the scheme of the Act, it was observed in connection with item 8 in s. 167 that "This Court has held that the minimum is the alternative: see Maqbool Hussain v. The State of Bombay "(2) . Here again, it is clear that the Court was not deciding the question that has now arisen before us. It only made a passing reference to the observation in Maqbool Hussein's case(2). It was not necessary for the decision of Babulal's case (1) to have pronounced on the correctness of the observation in Maqbool Hussain's case (2) and no such pronouncement was clearly intended. Nor was it necessary in Babulal's case (1) to express any view as to the maximum penalty that could be imposed under item 8 in s. 167.
The last case referred to is F. N. Roy v. The Collector of Customs,Calcutta (1). That was a case where an order had been made under item 8 in s. 167 confiscating certain goods imported without authority and imposing a penalty of Rs. 1,000/- in respect of that import. The importer filed a petition in this Court under Art. 32 (1) [1937] S.C.R. 1110, 1116.
It will be observed that the fine imposed was Rs. 1,000/-. It was not therefore a case in which any question could arise as to whether a penalty in excess of Rs. 1,000/-, could be imposed and in fact no such question arose. The question that arose was, whether the section offended Art. 14, so that, no penalty could be imposed under it at all. It was in this connection that it was observed that item 8 in s. 167 did not leave it to the uncontrolled discretion of the Customs authorities to decide the amount of the penalty because it had imposed a limit on that amount. It is true that the limit was there mentioned as Rs. 1,000/-. But it is clear that the reasoning would have held equally if it .had been said that the limit imposed was either three times the value of the goods or: Rs. 1,000/-. The point that was sought to be made in the judgment was that there was a limit and that that was a reason for saying that the discretion given was not uncontrolled and, therefore, there was no violation of Art. 14. For this purpose, it made no difference what the limit was.
Some of the High Courts have thought that this Court had decided in these cases that the maximum penalty permissible under the provision is Rs. 1,000/-. The fact is that the question was never required to be decided in any of these- cases and could not, therefore, have been, or be treated as, decided by this Court. In Leo Boy Frey v. The Superintendent, 'District JailAmritsar (1), this Court observed that " No question I has been raised as to the maximum amount of penalty that can be imposed under s. 167(8) and we are notcalled upon to express any opinion on that point. " This would show that this Court had taken notice of the fact that the High Courts were interpreting the judgment in F. N. Roy's case(") and the other case,% in a manner which was not intended and desired to strike a note of warning against the misconception. None of these cases is authority for the proposition that the maximum penalty which can be imposed under item 8in s. 167, is RE;. 1,000/-. The argument that this Court has already held that the maximum penalty that can be awarded under it is Rs. 1,000/- must therefore fail.

streets respectively shall be open at both ends. " It was held that both the conditions had to be fulfilled and the street had to be of the prescribed width and also open at both ends. One of the reasons given for this view was that the sentence was a negative one and the word " or " (being the one underlined by us*) in it carried forward the negative influence and made it necessary to fulfil both the conditions. 'It was said at pp. 447-48 :	Precedent

(3) [1957] S.C.R. 1151.
We now come to the construction of the provision, the relevant portion of which is in these terms:
The words which are material to this case are, "Any person concerned in any such offence shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding three times the value of the goods or not exceeding one thousand rupees. " The question is whether, in imposing a penalty, the conditions laid down in both the alternative clauses joined by the word " or " have to be fulfilled or the condition in any one of them only ? It is clear that if the words form an affirmative sentence, then the condition of one of the clauses only need be fulfilled. In such a case ,for " really means It either " "
would not have been repeated after the word " or " for the word " or " would have carried the negative influence forward and another negative would not,have been necessary. The acceptance of learned counsel's argument that "or" carried any negative influence forward, would make nonsense of the sentence.
It seems to us that the learned counsel really wants us to read the section as if the words were, " shall not be liable to a penalty exceeding three times the value of the goods, or exceeding one thousand rupees. " So read the sentence would be a negative one and the word "I or " would carry the negative influence forward. To do that would, however, bere-enacting and not interpreting. It is clear that each time the expression " not exceeding " is used, it qualifies the extent of the punishment that is stated after it. That expression is really equivalent to the words " up to " and can be easily substituted by them without affecting the sentence in any way. There is really no negative in the sentence and what we have, is a purely affirm. active provision laying down two alternative penalties to choose from, with a maximum for each.
The distinction between affirmative and negative sentences may be illustrated by the case of The, .Metropolitan Board of Works v. Steed (1). The provision there considered was, " No existing road, being of less width than forty feet, shall be ... formed as a street for the purposes of carriage traffic, unless such road be widened to the full width of forty feet ...or for the purposes of foot traffic only, unless such road be widened to the full width of twenty feet or unless such (1) (1881) L.R. S Q.B.D. 415.
It is obvious that the sentence before us contains, no negative or prohibitory provision. It only contains a positive provision empowering one of the two alternative penalties laid down to be imposed. The fact that the penalties are directed not to exceed a certain limit does not change the sentence from affirmative to negative; the sentence remains permissive and does not become prohibitory. It follows that any of the. alternative penalties provided may be imposed though the amount of it exceeds the amount of the maximum in the 'Other alternative. A consideration of the object of the Act also supports that view. The Act is vital for the country's economic stability. It is: intended to prevent smuggling in goods and such goods may be of large value. A small fine of Rs. 1,000/- would Here printed in italics.

167. While discussing whether a Customs authority exercising the power to order confiscation and levy a penalty under s. 167 formed a judicial tribunal, this Court observed at p. 742:
It is quite obvious that this observation was made in a different context and was not intended to decide (1) [1953] S.C.R. 730, that the provision did not permit the imposition of a higher penalty, as to which no question had then arisen. It is clear that if the highest penalty which the Customs officers had the power to impose was in excess of Rs. 1,000/- but subject to another limit, it would not have followed that they were judicial tribunals. The judgment of this Court was not based on ,the amount of the maximum penalty which the Customs authorities could impose. It seems rather to have been assumed that the maximum penalty was Rs. 1,000/-, for the question about maximum penalty was neither argued, nor discussed in the judgment at all.
The second case is Babulal Amthalal Mehta v. The Collector of Customs (1). The only question that arose there was whether s. 178A of the Sea Customs Act, which placed on the person from whose possession any goods mentioned in the section and reasonably believed to have been smuggled were seized, the burden of proving that they were not so, was void as offending Art. 14 of the Constitution.
