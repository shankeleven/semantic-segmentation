S. P. Sinha and B. C. Misra, for the appellant. G. C. Mathur and C. P. Lal, for the respondent. 1957. October 14. The following Judgment of the Court was delivered by SINHA J.-This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment and order dated August 12, 1953, of a Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court (Desai and Beg JJ.), setting aside the order of acquittal passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge at Allahabad, dated July 31, 1950, in Sessions Trial No. 22 of 1949.

In the view we take of the legality of the trial in this case, it is not necessary to go into the details of the prosecution case except to state that the appellant was charged under the sections aforesaid, for having committed criminal breach of trust in respect of valuable securities amounting to Rs. 7,410 odd of the Imperial Bank at Allahabad, while in the employment of the Bank as a clerk, and had in that capacity, " with intent to defraud, destroyed, altered, mutilated and falsified accounts and other papers " during January to July, 1946. A number of contentions were raised before us by the learned counsel for the appellants, but it is necessary to notice only two of them, namely, (1) that the appeal by the State of Uttar Pradesh, to the High Court, should not have been entertained as the memorandum of appeal did not comply with the requirements of law as laid down in ss. 418 and 419 of the Code of Criminal Procedure; and (2) that the trial in the Sessions Court was no trial at all in the eye of law. In respect of the first contention, it is enough to say that though the memorandum of appeal filed in the High Court was wholly inadequate, the defect was not such as to render it null and void so as to entitle the High Court to reject it in liming. The point arises in this way: Apart from the prayer, the only ground taken in the petition of appeal is "	PetArg
In our opinion, the legal position in the instant case is the same. It was., however, argued on behalf of the State Government that in the instant case, the jury had returned a unanimous verdict of not guilty and that, therefore, there was no prejudice to the accused persons. It is true that the incompetence of the jury empanelled in this case was raised by the counsel for the State Government in the High Court but in view of the findings arrived at by the High Court, as quoted above, the position is clear in law that irrespective of the result, it was no trial at all The question of prejudice does not arise because it is not a mere irregularity. but a case of "mis-trial", as the Judicial Committee put it. It is unfortunate that a prosecution which has been pending so long in respect of an offence which is said to have been committed about eleven years ago, should end like this but it will be open to the State Government, if it is so advised, to take steps for a retrial, as was directed by the Judicial Committee in the reported case referred to above.	RespArg
In our opinion, the remarks of the High Court quoted above give a correct impression of the proceedings in the Court of Session. It further appears from the judgment of the High Court that the learned Advocate General who argued the case in support of the appeal on behalf of the State, urged that the jurors were not equal to the task involved in a proper determination of the controversy. The High Court directed the trial court to hold an inquiry and report on this aspect of the case. On a consideration of the report submitted by that court, the High Court recorded its finding to the following effect:
On that finding, it is clear that the appellant's contention that it was a trial coram non judice is well-founded. This case is analogous to the case of Ras Behari Lal v. The King Emperor (1), which went up to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, from a judgment of the Patna High Court confirming the conviction and the sentences of the accused persons on a charge of murder and rioting. In that case, the trial was by a jury of 7. The jury by a majority of six to one found the accused guilty. The learned trial judge accepted the verdict and sentenced some of the accused persons to death. The High Court overruled the accused persons' contentions that there was no legal trial because some of the jury did not know sufficient English to follow the proceedings in Court. The Judicial Committee granted special leave to appeal on a report made by the High Court that one of the jurors did not know sufficient English to follow the proceedings in Court. Before the Judicial Committee, it was conceded, and in their Lordships' view, rightly, by counsel for the prosecution that the appellants had not been tried, and that, therefore, the convictions and sentences could not stand. Lord Atkin, who delivered the judgment of the Judicial Committee, made the following-	Precedent
1) (1933) L.R. 60 I.A. 354, 357.
The appeal is, accordingly, allowed and the convictions and the sentences are set aside. We do not express any opinion on the question whether it is a fit case for a de novo trial by a competent jury or by a Court of Session without a jury, if the present state of the law permits it. The matter will go back to the High Court for such directions as may be necessary if the High Court is moved by the Government in that behalf.
Appeal allowed.	Conclusion
