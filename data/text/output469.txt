Satya Dev Bushahri* vs Padam Dev And Others on 25 May, 1954	Case Title
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION.: Civil Appeal No. 52 of 1954. Appeal by Special Leave granted by this Court on the 25th January, 1954, from Judgment and Order dated the 23rd May, 1953, of the Election Tribunal, Himachal Pradesh, Simla, in Election Petition No. 14 of 1952.	Issue
1954. May 25. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMA AYYAR J.-This is an appeal against the order of the Election Tribunal, Himachal Pradesh, dismissing Election Petition No. 14 of 1952. On 12th October, 1951, five candidates (respondents 1 to 5 herein) were duly nominated for election to the Legislative Assembly of the State of Himachal Pradesh for the Rohru Constituency in Mahasu District. The polling took place on 23rd November, 1951, and on 30th November, 195 1, the first respondent was declared elected, he having secured the largest number of votes. The result was published in the Official Gazette on 20th December, 1951. On 14th February, 1952, one of the unsuccessful candidates, Gyan Singh, (fifth respondent herein) filed Election Petition No. 14 of 1952 challenging the validity of the election of the first respondent. On 4th August, 1952, he applied to withdraw from the petition, and that was permitted by an order of the Tribunal dated 20th September, 1952. The appellant, who is one of the electors in the Rohru Constituency, then applied to be brought on record as the petitioner, and that was ordered on 21st November, 1952. The petition was then heard on the merits.
Though a number of charges were pressed -at the trial, only two of them are material for the purpose of the present appeal: (1) that Sri Padam Dev was interested in contracts for the supply of Ayurvedic medicines to the Government, and was therefore disqualified for being chosen to the Assembly under section 7(d) of Act No. XLIII of 1951; and (2) that he had procured the assistance of Government servants for the furtherance of his election prospects, and had thereby contravened section 123(8) of that Act. The facts giving rise to this contention were that one Daulataram had subscribed in the nomination paper of Sri Padam Dev as proposer and one Motiram as seconder, both of them being Government servants employed in the post office, and,that one Sital Singh, an extra-departmental agent, was appointed by Sri Padam Dev as one of his polling agents at a booth at Arhal.

Then there is the question whether the appointment of Sital Singh as polling agent contravened section 123(8). The majority of the Tribunal was of the opinion that the appointment of a Government servant as polling agent was not by itself objectionable, but the third member thought otherwise. They, however, agreed in deciding the point against the appellant on the ground that it had not been expressly raised in the petition. It was argued for the appellant that as it was admitted at the trial that Sital Singh was appointed polling agent, the point was open to him as it was a (1) A.I.R. 1954 S.C. 236.	PetArg
By its judgment dated 25th September, 1953, the Election Tribunal held firstly that section 7(d) of Act No. XLIII of 1951 had not been made applicable to elections in Part C States, and that further there was no proof that on 12th October, 1951, the date of nomination, there were contracts subsisting between Sri Padam Dev and the Government. With reference to the charge under section 123(8), the Tribunal held by a majority that the section did not prohibit Government servants from merely proposing or seconding nomination papers, and that it had not been proved that Daulataram and Motiram did anything beyond that. As regards Sital Singh, while two of the members took the view that section 123(8) did not prohibit the appointment of a Government servant as polling agent, the third member was of a different opinion. But all of them concurred in holding that this point was not open to the petitioner, as it had not been specifically raised in the petition. In the result, the petition was dismissed. It is against this judgment that the present appeal has been brought by special leave, The first question that arises for determination is whether Sri Padam Dev was disqualified for being chosen to the Legislative Assembly by reason of his having held at the material dates contracts for the supply of Ayurvedic medicines to the Himachal Pradesh State Government. The answer to it must depend on the interpretation of the relevant provisions of Act No. XLIX of 1951, which governs elections to the Legislative Assemblies in Part C States. Section 17 which deals with disqualifications runs as follows:
We are concerned in this appeal only with article 102(1)(e). The contention of the appellant is that Act No. XLIII of 1951 being a law made by Parliament, the disqualifications laid down under section 7 therein would fall within article 102(1)(e)' and would under section 17 of Act No. XLIX Of 1951 be attracted to elections held under that Act, The respondent attempted several answers to this contention. He firstly contended that as Act No. XLIII of 1951 did not proprio vigore apply to elections in Part C States, he was not a person disqualified by or under the terms of that law as required by article 102(1)(e), and that therefore he was not hit by section 17. Though this contention might, at first thought, sound plausible, a closer examination of the language of section 17 shows that this is not its true import. The section does not enact that persons who are disqualified under a law made by Parliament shall be disqualified to be chosen under the Act. What it does enact is that if a person would be disqualified to be chosen to either House under an Act of Parliament, he would be dis- qualified to be chosen for the State Assembly. In other words, what would be a disqualification for a candidate being chosen to either House would be a disqualification to be chosen to the State Legislature. In this view, it is of no consequence that the candidate was not disqualified under section 7(d) by its own force.	RespArg
(b)if he is of unsound mind and stands so declared by a competent court;
disqualification was operative was not the date of dec- laration which was 30th November, 1951, but the date of the publication thereof in the Gazette, which was 20th December, 1951. It may be conceded in favour of the appellant that the observation of this Court in Chatturbhuj Vithaldas v. Moreshwar Parashram (1) that the material period starts with the nomination and ends with the announcement was not a decision on the' point. as it proceeded on an agreed statement of counsel on both sides. But as the appellant conceded before the Tribunal that the material date was the date of nomination and the entire trial proceeded on that basis, it is too late for him now to change his front and contend that the material date is 20th December, 1951. It remains to consider the contention that Sri Padam Dev had procured the assistance of Government servants, and had thereby brought himself within the mischief of section 123(8). The main objection before 'the Tribunal under this heading related to the subscribing of the nomination paper by Daulataram as proposer and Motiram as seconder. This question has since been decided adversely to the appellant in a recent decision of this Court reported in Rai Krushna Bose v. Binod Kanungo (2), where it was held that section 33(2) conferred the privilege of proposing or seconding a candidate on any person who was registered in the electoral roll, and that section 123 (8) could not be construed as taking away that privilege. This objection must, therefore, be overruled.
candidate or his agent had abused the right to appoint a Government servant as polling agent by exploiting the situation for furthering his election prospects, then the matter can be dealt with as an infringement of section 123(8). But the question which we have got to decide is whether as an abstract proposition of law the mere appointment of a Government servant as a polling agent is in itself and without more an infringement of section 123(8). Our answer is in the negative. In the present case, the finding is that beyond acting as polling agent Sital Singh did nothing. Nor is there any finding that the respondent in any manner availed himself of his presence at the polling booth to further his own election prospects. Thus there are no grounds for holding that section 123(8) had been contravened.	Precedent
Article 102 of the Constitution which becomes incorporated in the section by reference is as follows:
(a)if he holds any office of profit under the Government of India or the Government of any State, other than an office declared by Parliament by law not to disqualify its holder;
(c) if he is an undischarged insolvent;
(e) if he is so disqualified by or under any law made by Parliament."
It was next contended that whatever interpretation section 17 might be susceptible of if it had. stood alone, read in conjunction with section 8 of Act No. XLIX of 1951 it must be construed as excluding section 7(d) of Act No. XLIII of 1951. Section 8 of Act No. XLIX of 1951 enacts that Parts I and III to XI of Act No. XLIII of 1951 and the rules made thereunder apply to all elections under the Act, subject to such modifications as the President might direct. Section 7 occurs in Part II of Act No. XLIII of 1951, and that is not one of the parts extended under section 8. The argument is that section 7 having been omitted by design from the sections made applicable, the Legislature must be taken to have intended that it should not apply to elections held under the Act, and that section 17 should accordingly be so construed as not to defeat that intention. Reliance was placed on the well-known rules of construction that the provisions of a statute should be read in such manner as to give effect to all of them, and so as to avoid inconsistency and repugnancy. Both the sections can be given their full effect, it was argued, by holding that by reason of the non-inclusion of Part II under section 8, section 7 of Act No. XLIII of 1951 was inapplicable, and that, subject to that, the other provisions enacted by Parliament would apply under section 17. But this argument fails to take into account the scheme underlying Act No. XLIX of 1951. The framers of that Act wanted to enact a comprehensive code of election law for Part C States. They had before them Act No. XLIII of 1951, and they had to decide how much of it they would adopt. Part I of Act No. XLIII of 1951 consists only of short title and the interpretation section, and that was adopted in Act No. XLIX of 195 1. Part II of Act No. XLIII of 1951 deals with qualifications and disqualifications for membership. That subject is dealt with in sections 7 and 17 of Act No. XLIX of 1951. Section 7 sets out the qualifications and section 17, the disqualifications. It may also be noted that while disqualification for being chosen to either House of Parliament is laid down as a disqualification under section 17 the electoral roll for Parliament is to be taken under section 6 as the electoral roll for election to the State Assembly for the concerned area. These. provisions cover the very ground covered by Part 11, and therefore there was no need to extend any portion of it under section 8. Parts III to XI deal with the actual election from the commencement of the notification through all its stages and matters connected therewith, and they have been adopted en bloc in Act No. XLIX of 195 1. That being the general scheme, it is not possible to read into the omission of Part 11 under section 8, an intention that the disqualifications mentioned in section 7 should not apply to elections held under the Act. Nor is there any inconsistency between section 8 which passively omits Part II, and section 17 which positively enacts that what would be a disquali- fication under article 102 would be a disqualification for the purpose of this Act.
A good deal of argument was addressed to us based on the substantial identity of the language of section 17 with that of section 1 1 of Act No. XLIII of 195 1, which also occurs in Part II, which contains section 7. The contention is that if section 7 of Act No. XLIII of 1951 could be construed as comprised in section 17 of Act No. XLIX of 1951, it should also be held to have been comprised in section 1 1 of Act No. XLIII of 195 1, in which case, there was no need to enact two provisions in the same Act, one overlapping the other. The simpler thing, it was argued, would have been to. include section 1 1 in section 7 or vice versa. All this difficulty could be avoided, according to the respondent, if the reference to article 102 in section 11 is interpreted as limited to article 102(1) clauses (a) to (d) and not as including article 102(1) (e), in which case the same construction should logically be adopted for section 17. But this reasoning is inconclusive, because the scope of section 7 and that of article 102 which is incorporated by reference in section 11 are different. It must further be noted that section 1 1 occurs in a Chapter which deals exclusively with qualifications and disqualifications for membership to electoral college in Part C States. It is therefore not possible to draw any inference from the non-inclusion of section 7 in section 11 or vice versa. On the. other hand, the construction contended for by the respondent would give no meaning to the words " disqualified for being chosen as a member of either House of Parliament " in section 17. The result is that the qualifications laid down in section 7 of Act No. XLIII of 1951 must be held to be comprised within section 17 of the Act.
It was then contended that even on the footing that section 7 of Act No. XLIII of 1951 was comprised in section 17 of Act No. XLIX of 195 1, the respondent was not disqualified because under section 7(d) it would be a disqualification only if the candidate had entered into contracts with the appropriate Government, and under section 9(1) (a) "
Section 46 of Act No. XLIII of 1951 empowers a candidate to"appoint in the prescribed manner such number of agents and relief agents as may be prescribed to act as polling agents of such candidate at each polling station". Rule 12 of the Representation of the People (Con duct of Elections and Election Petitions) Rules, 1951, prescribes the formalities to be observed in the appointment of such agents, and Form 6 framed thereunder provides for the polling agent signing a declaration that he would do nothing forbidden by section 128. That -section enjoins that every agent shall maintain and aid in maintaining the secrecy of the voting. Thus, there is nothing in the Act or in the rules barring the appointment of a Government servant as a polling agent. And on the reasoning adopted in Raj Krushna Bose v. Binod Kanungo (1) with reference to section 33 (2), the conclusion must follow that such appointment does not per se contravene section 123(8). Nor is there anything in the nature of the duties of a polling agent, which necessarily brings him within the prohibition enacted in that section. The duty of a polling agent is merely to identify the voter, and that could not by itself and without more, be said to further the election prospects of the candidate. So long as the polling agent confines himself to his work as such agent of merely identifying the voters, it cannot be said that section 123(8) has, in any manner, been infringed.	Section

1954. May 25. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMA AYYAR J.-This is an appeal against the order of the Election Tribunal, Himachal Pradesh, dismissing Election Petition No. 14 of 1952. On 12th October, 1951, five candidates (respondents 1 to 5 herein) were duly nominated for election to the Legislative Assembly of the State of Himachal Pradesh for the Rohru Constituency in Mahasu District. The polling took place on 23rd November, 1951, and on 30th November, 195 1, the first respondent was declared elected, he having secured the largest number of votes. The result was published in the Official Gazette on 20th December, 1951. On 14th February, 1952, one of the unsuccessful candidates, Gyan Singh, (fifth respondent herein) filed Election Petition No. 14 of 1952 challenging the validity of the election of the first respondent. On 4th August, 1952, he applied to withdraw from the petition, and that was permitted by an order of the Tribunal dated 20th September, 1952. The appellant, who is one of the electors in the Rohru Constituency, then applied to be brought on record as the petitioner, and that was ordered on 21st November, 1952. The petition was then heard on the merits.
Though a number of charges were pressed -at the trial, only two of them are material for the purpose of the present appeal: (1) that Sri Padam Dev was interested in contracts for the supply of Ayurvedic medicines to the Government, and was therefore disqualified for being chosen to the Assembly under section 7(d) of Act No. XLIII of 1951; and (2) that he had procured the assistance of Government servants for the furtherance of his election prospects, and had thereby contravened section 123(8) of that Act. The facts giving rise to this contention were that one Daulataram had subscribed in the nomination paper of Sri Padam Dev as proposer and one Motiram as seconder, both of them being Government servants employed in the post office, and,that one Sital Singh, an extra-departmental agent, was appointed by Sri Padam Dev as one of his polling agents at a booth at Arhal.
By its judgment dated 25th September, 1953, the Election Tribunal held firstly that section 7(d) of Act No. XLIII of 1951 had not been made applicable to elections in Part C States, and that further there was no proof that on 12th October, 1951, the date of nomination, there were contracts subsisting between Sri Padam Dev and the Government. With reference to the charge under section 123(8), the Tribunal held by a majority that the section did not prohibit Government servants from merely proposing or seconding nomination papers, and that it had not been proved that Daulataram and Motiram did anything beyond that. As regards Sital Singh, while two of the members took the view that section 123(8) did not prohibit the appointment of a Government servant as polling agent, the third member was of a different opinion. But all of them concurred in holding that this point was not open to the petitioner, as it had not been specifically raised in the petition. In the result, the petition was dismissed. It is against this judgment that the present appeal has been brought by special leave, The first question that arises for determination is whether Sri Padam Dev was disqualified for being chosen to the Legislative Assembly by reason of his having held at the material dates contracts for the supply of Ayurvedic medicines to the Himachal Pradesh State Government. The answer to it must depend on the interpretation of the relevant provisions of Act No. XLIX of 1951, which governs elections to the Legislative Assemblies in Part C States. Section 17 which deals with disqualifications runs as follows:
Article 102 of the Constitution which becomes incorporated in the section by reference is as follows:
(a)if he holds any office of profit under the Government of India or the Government of any State, other than an office declared by Parliament by law not to disqualify its holder;
(b)if he is of unsound mind and stands so declared by a competent court;
(c) if he is an undischarged insolvent;
(d) if he is not a citizen of India, or has voluntarily acquired the citizenship of a foreign State, or is under any acknowledgment of allegiance or adherence to a foreign State; -
(e) if he is so disqualified by or under any law made by Parliament."
We are concerned in this appeal only with article 102(1)(e). The contention of the appellant is that Act No. XLIII of 1951 being a law made by Parliament, the disqualifications laid down under section 7 therein would fall within article 102(1)(e)' and would under section 17 of Act No. XLIX Of 1951 be attracted to elections held under that Act, The respondent attempted several answers to this contention.

Section 7 sets out the qualifications and section 17, the disqualifications. It may also be noted that while disqualification for being chosen to either House of Parliament is laid down as a disqualification under section 17 the electoral roll for Parliament is to be taken under section 6 as the electoral roll for election to the State Assembly for the concerned area. These. provisions cover the very ground covered by Part 11, and therefore there was no need to extend any portion of it under section 8.

Nor is there any inconsistency between section 8 which passively omits Part II, and section 17 which positively enacts that what would be a disquali- fication under article 102 would be a disqualification for the purpose of this Act.
A good deal of argument was addressed to us based on the substantial identity of the language of section 17 with that of section 1 1 of Act No. XLIII of 195 1, which also occurs in Part II, which contains section 7.

It was then contended that even on the footing that section 7 of Act No. XLIII of 1951 was comprised in section 17 of Act No. XLIX of 195 1, the respondent was not disqualified because under section 7(d) it would be a disqualification only if the candidate had entered into contracts with the appropriate Government, and under section 9(1) (a) "
disqualification was operative was not the date of dec- laration which was 30th November, 1951, but the date of the publication thereof in the Gazette, which was 20th December, 1951. It may be conceded in favour of the appellant that the observation of this Court in Chatturbhuj Vithaldas v. Moreshwar Parashram (1) that the material period starts with the nomination and ends with the announcement was not a decision on the' point. as it proceeded on an agreed statement of counsel on both sides. But as the appellant conceded before the Tribunal that the material date was the date of nomination and the entire trial proceeded on that basis, it is too late for him now to change his front and contend that the material date is 20th December, 1951. It remains to consider the contention that Sri Padam Dev had procured the assistance of Government servants, and had thereby brought himself within the mischief of section 123(8). The main objection before 'the Tribunal under this heading related to the subscribing of the nomination paper by Daulataram as proposer and Motiram as seconder. This question has since been decided adversely to the appellant in a recent decision of this Court reported in Rai Krushna Bose v. Binod Kanungo (2), where it was held that section 33(2) conferred the privilege of proposing or seconding a candidate on any person who was registered in the electoral roll, and that section 123 (8) could not be construed as taking away that privilege. This objection must, therefore, be overruled.
Then there is the question whether the appointment of Sital Singh as polling agent contravened section 123(8). The majority of the Tribunal was of the opinion that the appointment of a Government servant as polling agent was not by itself objectionable, but the third member thought otherwise. They, however, agreed in deciding the point against the appellant on the ground that it had not been expressly raised in the petition. It was argued for the appellant that as it was admitted at the trial that Sital Singh was appointed polling agent, the point was open to him as it was a (1) A.I.R. 1954 S.C. 236.
(2) 1954 S.C.J. 286, pure question of law. As the facts are admitted, and the question itself has been considered by the Tribunal, and as the point is one of considerable practical importance, we have heard arguments on it.
Section 46 of Act No. XLIII of 1951 empowers a candidate to"appoint in the prescribed manner such number of agents and relief agents as may be prescribed to act as polling agents of such candidate at each polling station". Rule 12 of the Representation of the People (Con duct of Elections and Election Petitions) Rules, 1951, prescribes the formalities to be observed in the appointment of such agents, and Form 6 framed thereunder provides for the polling agent signing a declaration that he would do nothing forbidden by section 128. That -section enjoins that every agent shall maintain and aid in maintaining the secrecy of the voting. Thus, there is nothing in the Act or in the rules barring the appointment of a Government servant as a polling agent. And on the reasoning adopted in Raj Krushna Bose v. Binod Kanungo (1) with reference to section 33 (2), the conclusion must follow that such appointment does not per se contravene section 123(8). Nor is there anything in the nature of the duties of a polling agent, which necessarily brings him within the prohibition enacted in that section. The duty of a polling agent is merely to identify the voter, and that could not by itself and without more, be said to further the election prospects of the candidate. So long as the polling agent confines himself to his work as such agent of merely identifying the voters, it cannot be said that section 123(8) has, in any manner, been infringed.
It is argued for the appellant that leaving aside the world of theories and entering into the realm of practical politics, the appointment of a Government servant as polling agent by one of the candidates must result in the dice being loaded heavily against the other candidate, and that situations might be conceived in which the presence of a Government servant of rank and importance as polling agent of one of the candidates might prove to be a source of unfair election practices. But if that is established, and if it is made out that the (1) 1954 S.C.J. 286.
candidate or his agent had abused the right to appoint a Government servant as polling agent by exploiting the situation for furthering his election prospects, then the matter can be dealt with as an infringement of section 123(8). But the question which we have got to decide is whether as an abstract proposition of law the mere appointment of a Government servant as a polling agent is in itself and without more an infringement of section 123(8). Our answer is in the negative. In the present case, the finding is that beyond acting as polling agent Sital Singh did nothing. Nor is there any finding that the respondent in any manner availed himself of his presence at the polling booth to further his own election prospects. Thus there are no grounds for holding that section 123(8) had been contravened.
In the result, the appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.
