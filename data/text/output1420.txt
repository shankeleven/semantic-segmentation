CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 443 of 1957. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated April 25, 1955, of the Allahabad High Court in Civil Misc. Case No. 26/1951.
C. B. Aggarwala, C. P. Lal for G. Ar. Dikshit, for the appellant.
The High Court answered the question as follows:	Issue
Against the order of the High Court recording its answer, this appeal with special leave is preferred. The facts which give rise to the appeal are briefly these :	Facts
and as s. 3(A) was one of the sections of this enactment, it would have effect from the earlier date. This inadvertent error, however, would not affect the central point of the reasoning of the learned Judges. Besides elaborating the other points in the judgment of the High Court, learned Counsel for the respondent further pressed upon us that there was no specific provision in the Act for refund or reassessment which would have been present if the levy of a rate with retrospective effect were contemplated by the Act as applicable to the assessees who bad opted for the " previous-year-turnover " basis of assessment. He pointed out that in the case of those assessees who opted for their being assessed in respect of their turn. over during the assessment year, quarterly returns were submitted along with the payment provisionally of the tax due on the basis of that return, the final assessment being completed only after the close of the year when the amount due for the year was ascertained and a demand made for the balance due after adjustment of the amounts already paid during the course of the year (Rule
It was, however, submitted that though the statute might not say so in express terms, still by reason of the provisions of the Act and the Rules under, which the "
Under this power besides the specified goods, the State Government might from time to time exempt other goods from among those whose sale proceeds have to be included in the turnover. If an exemption of that type were granted say in 1948-49, it cannot be contended that the turnover of the dealer who had opted for the " previous year " has to include these sales in the return which he submits in Form IV, If by the date of the submission of the return, the exemption has been notified, and has effect for the entire year of course he need not include these sale proceeds in his return. The computation, therefore, of the quantum of turnover of the previous year on which tax has to be levied is one which is subject to the law in relation to it in the assessment year, and any change in that law presents the same problems, as the variation in the rate of tax.
The next question is how on the terms of the notification which came into operation after the commencement of the assessment year and during the course of it, the proportion of the turnover on the basis of which the tax-liability of a previous-year's turnover dealer could be computed. Learned Counsel for the respondent urged that no intelligible basis could be suggested for distinguishing the two periods in the previous year when the original rates and the altered notified rates would operate. Learned Counsel urged that it would be impossible to distinguish these two periods either on any theory of retrospectivity of the notification or on any theory regarding the sales of the previous year being attributed to the corresponding dates of the current year. There is no doubt that this mode of computing the proportion, viz., to treat the sales which were effected on various dates of the previous year, as if they were sales on the corresponding dates of the current year and thus to compute the two totals of turnover which would be subject to different rates of duty would not be proper. The impropriety would arise from the fact that the fiction enacted by s. 7(1) is not that each day's sale in the previous year is deemed to be a sale on the corresponding date in the current year, but only that the total taxable turnover of the previous year is deemed to be that of the current year. The method to which objection is taken is however not the manner in which the Sales-tax Officer computed the proportion which was affirmed by the Judge (Revision). If the total of the sale proceeds of the previous year is deemed to be the total of the current year, there is no illogicality or impropriety in dividing that total in accordance with the number of days in the year in which the different rates prevailed and that is precisely what the Sales-tax Officer did.
If as we hold both the computation of the turnover of the previous year, as well as the incidence of the tax leviable on it, are to be determined not merely by the law as it stood on the first day of the assessment year, but by the law applicable to assessments during the entire assessment year, the method by which the tax-liability of the respondent was computed by the Sales-tax Officer is not open to any objection.	RespArg
S. K. Kapur and Mohan Behari Lal, for the respondent. 1960. October 31. The Judgment of Hidayatullah, Das Gupta and Shah, JJ., was delivered by Shah, J., and the judgment of Das and Ayyangar, JJ., was delivered by Ayyangar, J. SHAH J.-Judge (Revisions) exercising authority under s. 11 of the United Provinces Sales Tax Act XV of 1948 drew up a statement of case and referred to the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad the follow- question :
In exercise of the authority conferred by s. 3-A which was incorporated in the Act by Act XXV of 1948, the Government of U. P. issed the following notification :
2. The Governor is further pleased to order that as from June 9, 1948, the rate of tax in respect of the turnover of the aforesaid goods shall be as entered in column 3 of the Schedule hereto.
3. Every dealer, by or on whose behalf goods mentioned in the schedule aforesaid are held at the close of the 8th day of June, 1948, shall submit a statement showing the quantity and price of such stock and of the stock of such goods held on the 24th day of May, 1948, to the appropriate assessing authority by the 30th day of June, 1948 ".
Rules were framed by Government inter alia under the power conferred by the 1st proviso just now set out and by rule 39 of the said rules an option was given to dealers to submit returns of their turnover of the assessment year in lieu of the turnover of the previous year.
In connection with the interpretation of the notification a minor point was suggested to which brief reference might be made. It was submitted that as the notification in effect levied a tax, if it was ambiguous, it should be resolved in favour of the subject-the tax-payer. We see no ambiguity in the notification to justify an appeal to this rule. Besides the notification in effect frees dealers other than importers and manufacturers of all tax-liability in respect of the sale-turnover of oil, though in the case of two specified classes of dealers. a single point tax at an enhanced rate is levied. In such a situation, the rule of construction invoked could hardly be applied, even if the condition as to ambiguity were present.	Precedent
To this notification was appended a schedule which set out the descriptions of diverse commodities, the "circumstances under Which the turnover was to be calculated " the point of tax and the rate of tax. Item 14 of the schedule was " oils of all kinds excluding edible oils but including Vanaspati "
By the U. P. Sales Tax Amendment Act, 1948 (Act XXV of 1948) this proviso was slightly modified and s. 3(A) was inserted in the Act reading as follows:
(A list of goods was then set out) and nine pies per rupee if it relates to any other goods." Non-edible oil which is the commodity with the sale of which the assessment in the present appeal is concerned is not in the list of goods set out in s. 3(A) and would therefore be covered by the residuary clause of the section. The U. P. Government issued the following notification dated June 8, 1948, under s. 3(A) of the Act:
In the Schedule annexed to this notification, nonedible oil of the type dealt with by the assessee was subject to a tax @ 6 pies per rupee if the same was manufactured in U. P. Section 7 of the Act, as it stood at the date relevant to this appeal, enacted :
The learned Judges answered the question in favour of the assessee and held that the notification under s. 3(A) could not apply to determine the rate of tax payable by the assessee on his turnover of the previous year. The present appeal is against this answer by the High Court. As the arguments before us proceeded on practically the same lines as before the High Court, it will be convenient if we set out the reasoning by which the learned Judges upheld the asssessee's contention that the notification under s. 3(A) was inapplicable to determine the rate of tax payable by it. The grounds were mainly five: (1) The assessee could not be charged at the rates prescribed by the notification unless the new rates operated retrospectively; (2) that s. 3(A) which was introduced into the parent Act (Act XV of 1948) by the Amending Act XXV of 1948 was not enacted with retrospective effect. Though the charge imposed by s. 3(1) of the Act read with s. 7(1) imposed tax retrospectively as and from April 1, 1948, s. 3(A) did not on its terms so operate as and from that date. Hence the liability of the assessee which had become fixed under Act XV of 1948, as it originally stood, could not be and 'Was not varied by s. 3(A) and would not therefore be affected by any notification issued under the last mentioned provision ; (3) that a notification under s. 3(A) could not have retrospective effect since s. 3(A) itself did not operate of its own force and merely empowered the Government, 'by a notification, to effect changes in the law and hence such changes when notified could not operate as from any date prior to the date of the notification ; (4) Section 3(A) which used the words " in respect of such sales " contemplated particular sales taking place after the notification issued under it and hence the notification issued under that section could not alter the rate of levy in respect of sales anterior to the date of the notification ; (5) that the terms of the notification carried out the general scheme of the Act and negatived retrospective operation and that as on its langu- age it applied only to sales which took place on or admittedly effected long prior thereto in the previous year the same could not be affected by the enhanced rate of duty. Before proceeding further it must be pointed out that the learned Judges of the High Court were not right in thinking that s. 3(A) was not enacted to operate retrospectively from the commencement of the' parent Act. Section 1(2) of the Sales-tax Amending Act XXV of 1948 which introduced s. 3(A) enacted:
We shall now proceed to examine these submissions. On the scheme of U. P. Sales-tax Act, as of every other sales-tax legislation in the other Indian States, the total tax liability of an assessee is the resultant product of two factors: (1) the total of the proceeds of sales effected during a given period, universally a year, from which are deducted the turnover of the sales of commodities which are exempt from tax; for instance under s. 4 of the Act whose provisions will be referred to later; (2) multiplied by the rate of tax applicable either to the entire turnover or where' different rates are prescribed on sales of different articles, such rates in respect of such turnover. The best way to appreciate the scheme underlying the Act would be to ascertain the position at the time the Act was enacted. It received the assent of the Governor and was published in the Gazette on June 5, 1948. Section 1(2) of the Act further enacted that " It shall be deemed to have come into force on April 1, 1948 ". Except to that limited extent, the Act is prospective. The tax is on the "
So far, therefore, as the express provisions of the Act go, no difference is made between the basis of the tax liability of the " previous-year-turnover " and the " assessment-year- turnover " assessees; and though by reason of the terms of s. 7(1) the quantum of the turnover varies no other variation in the law applicable to the two types of assessees is contemplated. We must therefore start from the premise that the Act does not contemplate any difference in the incidence of the tax and the quantum of tax liability flowing from the choice of either the " previous-year " or the " assessment-year " as the basis of the determination of the turnover. We should add that learned Counsel for the respondent has not been able to point out any provision in the Act or in the Rules pointing to any such differentiation.
Even apart from this, under a. 10(2) of the Act the dealer or the department as the case may be may apply to the Revising authority for revision of the assessment on the ground that the same is not legal, proper or regular. This section enacts:
The orders which the Revising Authority could pass might either be by way of enhancement or reduction, and the subsequent sub-sections provide: .	Section
previous-year-turnover " under s. 7(1), and the turnover thus computed is charged at the same rate of tax applicable to transactions of the current year.
It is, therefore, not correct to say that there is no machinery for rectifying errors and for making consequential orders for payment of further tax, or for directing refunds, and this argument cannot therefore justify the construction contended for by the respondent.
The date mentioned in the notification as the date from and after which sales would be charged at the new rates would therefore not militate against the new rates being applied to the turnover of the previous year, since the turnover of the previous year has to be assessed on the rates prevailing in the assessment year.
We, therefore, hold that the assessment to sales-tax of the respondent company by applying to its turnover of the year 1947-48, the rate of tax specified in the notification of June 8, 1948, as determined by the Sales-tax Officer was in accordance with the law. We would accordingly allow the appeal, set aside the decree of the High Court and restore the assessment order of the Sales-tax Officer with costs here and in the High Court.
BY COURT.-In accordance with the opinion of the majority, the appeal is dismissed with costs.	Conclusion
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 443 of 1957. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated April 25, 1955, of the Allahabad High Court in Civil Misc. Case No. 26/1951.
C. B. Aggarwala, C. P. Lal for G. Ar. Dikshit, for the appellant.
S. K. Kapur and Mohan Behari Lal, for the respondent. 1960. October 31. The Judgment of Hidayatullah, Das Gupta and Shah, JJ., was delivered by Shah, J., and the judgment of Das and Ayyangar, JJ., was delivered by Ayyangar, J. SHAH J.-Judge (Revisions) exercising authority under s. 11 of the United Provinces Sales Tax Act XV of 1948 drew up a statement of case and referred to the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad the follow- question :
The High Court answered the question as follows:
Against the order of the High Court recording its answer, this appeal with special leave is preferred. The facts which give rise to the appeal are briefly these :
was defined as meaning the aggregate of the proceeds of sale by a dealer. By s. 3, a tax at the rate of 3 pies per rupee of turnover was, subject to certain exceptions, made payable by every dealer in each assessment year whose turn. over in the previous year exceeded Rs. 12,000 or such larger amount as may be prescribed; the Provincial Government was however authorised to reduce the rate of tax on any dealer or class of dealers on the turnover in respect of any goods or class of goods. By s. 3-A, the Government of U. P. was authorised to introduce instead of the multiple point scheme of taxation provided by s. 3 a single point system of taxation and by notification to declare that the proceeds of sale of any goods or class of goods shall not be included in the turnover of any dealer except to such single point in the series of sales by successive dealers as may be prescribed; and if the Government made such a declaration, the turnover of the dealer in whose turnover the sale of such goods was included was in respect of such sale to be taxed at such rate as may be specified not exceeding one anna per rupee. By s. 7, every dealer whose turnover in the previous year was Rs. 12,000 or more was directed to submit such return or returns of his turnover of the previous year within sixty days of the commencement of the assessment year in such form and verified in such manner as may be prescribed. By the proviso, the Government was authorised to prescribe that any dealer or class of dealers may submit in lieu of the return or returns specified in that section, a return or returns of his turnover of the assessment year at such intervals as may be prescribed. Provision was made by the Act for appeals against the order of assessment and revision against the order of the appellate authority. By s. 11, the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad was authorised to decide questions of law raised in any case in the course of assessment and referred to it on a statement of the case drawn up by the Revising Authority. By s. 24. the Provincial, Government was invested with power to make rules to carry out the purposes of the Act and in particular in respect of certain specified matters.
In exercise of the powers conferred by s. 24 of the Act, the Government of U. P. framed rules. Rule 39 of the U. P. Sales Tax Rules gave to every dealer an option to submit his return of the turnover of the assessment year in lieu of the return of the turnover of the previous year. A dealer who did not carry on business during the whole of the previous year had no option, but was bound to submit his return of the turnover of the assessment year. By r. 40, it was provided that every dealer who elected to submit a return of the turnover of his previous year shall within sixty days of the commencement of the assessment year, submit to the Sales Tax Officer a return showing his turnover of the previous year. By r. 41, it was provided that every dealer whose estimated turnover during the assessment year was not less than Rs. 15,000 and who elected to submit his return of such year shall before the last day of July, October, January and April submit to the Sales Tax Officer, a return of his gross turnover for the quarters ending June 30, September 30, December 31 and March 31.
In exercise of the authority conferred by s. 3-A which was incorporated in the Act by Act XXV of 1948, the Government of U. P. issed the following notification :
To this notification was appended a schedule which set out the descriptions of diverse commodities, the "circumstances under Which the turnover was to be calculated " the point of tax and the rate of tax. Item 14 of the schedule was " oils of all kinds excluding edible oils but including Vanaspati "
By the U. P. Sales Tax Amendment Act, 1948 (Act XXV of 1948) this proviso was slightly modified and s. 3(A) was inserted in the Act reading as follows:
(A list of goods was then set out) and nine pies per rupee if it relates to any other goods." Non-edible oil which is the commodity with the sale of which the assessment in the present appeal is concerned is not in the list of goods set out in s. 3(A) and would therefore be covered by the residuary clause of the section. The U. P. Government issued the following notification dated June 8, 1948, under s. 3(A) of the Act:
2. The Governor is further pleased to order that as from June 9, 1948, the rate of tax in respect of the turnover of the aforesaid goods shall be as entered in column 3 of the Schedule hereto.
3. Every dealer, by or on whose behalf goods mentioned in the schedule aforesaid are held at the close of the 8th day of June, 1948, shall submit a statement showing the quantity and price of such stock and of the stock of such goods held on the 24th day of May, 1948, to the appropriate assessing authority by the 30th day of June, 1948 ".
In the Schedule annexed to this notification, nonedible oil of the type dealt with by the assessee was subject to a tax @ 6 pies per rupee if the same was manufactured in U. P. Section 7 of the Act, as it stood at the date relevant to this appeal, enacted :
Rules were framed by Government inter alia under the power conferred by the 1st proviso just now set out and by rule 39 of the said rules an option was given to dealers to submit returns of their turnover of the assessment year in lieu of the turnover of the previous year.
The assessee exercised the option of being assessed on the basis of the turnover of the previous year under s. 7(1) of the Act and in respect of first assessment year after the Act came to force-assessment year 1948-49, it filed a return in respect of the turnover of its previous year June 1, 1946 to May 31, 1947. The total turnover of the assessee during this period was Rs. 63,02,849-7-7. The Sales Tax Officer by his order dated March 12, 1949, assessed the turnover in respect of edible oil at 3 pies per rupee. As regards the sale of non-edible oil, the sales-tax officer hold that since the notification set out above under s. 3(A) had come into force as and from June 9 of the assessment year, the assessee was liable to be assessed @ 3 pies per rupee on the turnover during the first 69 days of the year and @ 6 pies per rupee in respect of the remaining days of the year and he computed the' tax accordingly. The assessee preferred an appeal to the Judge (Appeals), Meerut Range, Meerut, against the order of the Sales-Tax Officer. This officer allowed the appeal of the assessee and held that the entire turnover was liable to be taxed only at a flat rate of 3 pies per rupee under s. 3(1) of the Act on all oil sold by the assessee---edible or non-edible. The reason assigned for the order was that on the terms of the notification the new rate of tax could not be applied to sales effected in the previous year which had been opted for the purposes of assessment by the assessee and that so to apply it would be tantamount to giving retrospective effect to the notification which was contraindicated by the terms of the notification itself. The department thereupon moved the Judge (Revision) who accepted its contention and restored the order of the Sales-tax Officer applying the provisions of the notification to the turnover of the assessee. There. after the assessee made an application to the Judge (Revision) to state a case for the opinion of the High Court under s. 11 of the Act as to whether the rate of tax fixed by the notification could be applied to the sales of the commodity which factually took place on or before June 8, 1948. This petition having been dismissed, an application was filed before the High Court for directing the reference and on this being ordered the following question (as reframed by the High Court) was referred to it for determination :
The learned Judges answered the question in favour of the assessee and held that the notification under s. 3(A) could not apply to determine the rate of tax payable by the assessee on his turnover of the previous year. The present appeal is against this answer by the High Court. As the arguments before us proceeded on practically the same lines as before the High Court, it will be convenient if we set out the reasoning by which the learned Judges upheld the asssessee's contention that the notification under s. 3(A) was inapplicable to determine the rate of tax payable by it. The grounds were mainly five: (1) The assessee could not be charged at the rates prescribed by the notification unless the new rates operated retrospectively; (2) that s. 3(A) which was introduced into the parent Act (Act XV of 1948) by the Amending Act XXV of 1948 was not enacted with retrospective effect. Though the charge imposed by s. 3(1) of the Act read with s. 7(1) imposed tax retrospectively as and from April 1, 1948, s. 3(A) did not on its terms so operate as and from that date. Hence the liability of the assessee which had become fixed under Act XV of 1948, as it originally stood, could not be and 'Was not varied by s. 3(A) and would not therefore be affected by any notification issued under the last mentioned provision ; (3) that a notification under s. 3(A) could not have retrospective effect since s. 3(A) itself did not operate of its own force and merely empowered the Government, 'by a notification, to effect changes in the law and hence such changes when notified could not operate as from any date prior to the date of the notification ; (4) Section 3(A) which used the words " in respect of such sales " contemplated particular sales taking place after the notification issued under it and hence the notification issued under that section could not alter the rate of levy in respect of sales anterior to the date of the notification ; (5) that the terms of the notification carried out the general scheme of the Act and negatived retrospective operation and that as on its langu- age it applied only to sales which took place on or admittedly effected long prior thereto in the previous year the same could not be affected by the enhanced rate of duty. Before proceeding further it must be pointed out that the learned Judges of the High Court were not right in thinking that s. 3(A) was not enacted to operate retrospectively from the commencement of the' parent Act. Section 1(2) of the Sales-tax Amending Act XXV of 1948 which introduced s. 3(A) enacted:
and as s. 3(A) was one of the sections of this enactment, it would have effect from the earlier date. This inadvertent error, however, would not affect the central point of the reasoning of the learned Judges. Besides elaborating the other points in the judgment of the High Court, learned Counsel for the respondent further pressed upon us that there was no specific provision in the Act for refund or reassessment which would have been present if the levy of a rate with retrospective effect were contemplated by the Act as applicable to the assessees who bad opted for the " previous-year-turnover " basis of assessment. He pointed out that in the case of those assessees who opted for their being assessed in respect of their turn. over during the assessment year, quarterly returns were submitted along with the payment provisionally of the tax due on the basis of that return, the final assessment being completed only after the close of the year when the amount due for the year was ascertained and a demand made for the balance due after adjustment of the amounts already paid during the course of the year (Rule
41). Obviously in their case no difficulty could arise by reason of any change in the law either in the rate or basis of taxation effected during the year, as these would automatically be given effect to in the final assessment. If, however, changes made in the rate of tax payable during the year were held applicable to those assessees who had opted for the previous-year-turnover basis, necessary adjustments could not be made in their assessment for lack of specific machinery to achieve the same. From this he argued that the scheme of the Act was that in the case of the previous-year-turnover assessees, to use a convenient phrase, the tax liability had to be determined on the state of the law as it prevailed on the 1st day of the assessment year and that it got fixed and crystallised on that date and remained unaffected by any changes in the law effected during the course of the assessment year.
In view of these additional submissions, we consider that it would be convenient to examine the entire argument of learned Counsel for the respondent under three heads into which they naturally fall:
We shall now proceed to examine these submissions. On the scheme of U. P. Sales-tax Act, as of every other sales-tax legislation in the other Indian States, the total tax liability of an assessee is the resultant product of two factors: (1) the total of the proceeds of sales effected during a given period, universally a year, from which are deducted the turnover of the sales of commodities which are exempt from tax; for instance under s. 4 of the Act whose provisions will be referred to later; (2) multiplied by the rate of tax applicable either to the entire turnover or where' different rates are prescribed on sales of different articles, such rates in respect of such turnover. The best way to appreciate the scheme underlying the Act would be to ascertain the position at the time the Act was enacted. It received the assent of the Governor and was published in the Gazette on June 5, 1948. Section 1(2) of the Act further enacted that " It shall be deemed to have come into force on April 1, 1948 ". Except to that limited extent, the Act is prospective. The tax is on the "
previous-year-turnover " under s. 7(1), and the turnover thus computed is charged at the same rate of tax applicable to transactions of the current year.
So far, therefore, as the express provisions of the Act go, no difference is made between the basis of the tax liability of the " previous-year-turnover " and the " assessment-year- turnover " assessees; and though by reason of the terms of s. 7(1) the quantum of the turnover varies no other variation in the law applicable to the two types of assessees is contemplated. We must therefore start from the premise that the Act does not contemplate any difference in the incidence of the tax and the quantum of tax liability flowing from the choice of either the " previous-year " or the " assessment-year " as the basis of the determination of the turnover. We should add that learned Counsel for the respondent has not been able to point out any provision in the Act or in the Rules pointing to any such differentiation.
It was, however, submitted that though the statute might not say so in express terms, still by reason of the provisions of the Act and the Rules under, which the "
previous year turnover " assessee got crystallised as on the 1st of April of the assessment year and that the Act did not contemplate this being disturbed by any subsequent changes in the substantive law relating to assessment during the assessment year. It was said that the tax liability of the dealer who had opted for the " previous-year " basis had to be determined on foot of two factors and only two: (1) the turnover of the sales of the previous year which is a definite and known figure by the 31st of March of the previous year and (2) the rate of tax on the turnover as it prevailed on the 1st of April of the assessment year when it was said that there was a "crystallisation" of the liability to tax. It was pointed out that it was possible for an assessee to submit his return on the basis of the "
previous year-turnover " group and the " assessment-year- turnover " dealers, the Sales-Tax Officer would have to afford every assessee, whatever be the basis of this turnover-the benefit of the tax reduction. The position reached therefore is that if the change in the rate (we have assumed it to be by way of reduction, but the argument would equally apply to variation in any kind), were effected before the actual assessment, it should be given effect to in the case of every assessee for not merely is there no procedural complication in the shape of a need for refund- but it would be in accordance with the, law and in fact one might go further and say that any other mode of proceeding would not be countenanced by the Act, because the statute homologises the basis of the tax-whether the turnover is computed on the previous year's or the current year's sales. Next in regard to cases where the change in the law is effected after the completion of the assessment we consider that the submission regarding the absence of machinery for reassessment and refund is not well founded. It is true that there are no provisions specially so designated to meet this contingency here referred to, but that is not the same thing as saying that there is a complete absence of machinery. In the first place, s. 22 of the Act empowers authorities including the assessing officer to rectify any mistake apparent on the face of the record and by such rectification even to enhance the tax liability. If on the premises assumed, the variation in the rate of tax would on a proper construction of the Act be applicable to the turnover of the dealer who has opted for the " previous- year rule " but the assessment order does not give effect to it, it would certainly be a case of an error apparent on the face of the record, which would bring the case within the power of rectification. On the analogy of the cases under s. 35 of the Income Tax Act, 1922, the assessment officer could order rectification in such cases.
Even apart from this, under a. 10(2) of the Act the dealer or the department as the case may be may apply to the Revising authority for revision of the assessment on the ground that the same is not legal, proper or regular. This section enacts:
The orders which the Revising Authority could pass might either be by way of enhancement or reduction, and the subsequent sub-sections provide: .
It is, therefore, not correct to say that there is no machinery for rectifying errors and for making consequential orders for payment of further tax, or for directing refunds, and this argument cannot therefore justify the construction contended for by the respondent.
In the entire discussion up to now we have proceeded on the assumption that the turnover of " the previous-year " of the dealer was a fixed quantity which was finally determined once and for ever on the 31st March of that year and that the problem was merely to find the rate of tax to be applied to this predetermined factor. It will be seen from an examination of the Act that even the factor of the turnover is subject to variation. For instance, the first part of s. 4 enacts:
Under this power besides the specified goods, the State Government might from time to time exempt other goods from among those whose sale proceeds have to be included in the turnover. If an exemption of that type were granted say in 1948-49, it cannot be contended that the turnover of the dealer who had opted for the " previous year " has to include these sales in the return which he submits in Form IV, If by the date of the submission of the return, the exemption has been notified, and has effect for the entire year of course he need not include these sale proceeds in his return. The computation, therefore, of the quantum of turnover of the previous year on which tax has to be levied is one which is subject to the law in relation to it in the assessment year, and any change in that law presents the same problems, as the variation in the rate of tax.
Up to now the discussion has proceeded on the basis that a change in the law made in the assessment year whether as regards the computation of the turnover or as to the rate of levy, is effective throughout that year, i.e., from the 1st April to the 31st March, and it is found that the fact that the returns of the previous year turnover dealers are required to or are submitted within the early part of the year, or the contention based on the absence of specific machinery for reassessment or refund are an insufficient basis for holding that a change in the law affecting the basis of tax-liability would not affect the previous-year turnover assessees and that the machinery provided by ss. 10 and 22 are adequate to meet the contingencies arising out of the changes being retrospectively effected after the assessments were completed.
We shall next proceed to consider whether the change in the law either as regards the computation of the taxable turnover or as regards the rate of tax becoming operative sometime after the year has commenced makes any difference. In the case of the "assessment-year-turnover " dealers, there is no problem because the sales effected during the course of the year would be governed by the law applicable from time to time. The entire basis or theory of the tax being levied on foot of the previous year's turnover is that notwithstanding that factually the sales took place in the previous year they are to be deemed by fiction to have taken place in the year of assessment. If that theory be discarded there could be no legal foundation for the tax being levied by the Act even as originally enacted on a sale which factually took place before it was operative. The only question therefore is the precise scope of that fiction and its logical implication. If the sale in the previous year is treated by the Act as a sale in the present year, then no principle is contravened, if it were held that sales during a portion of the previous year are held to be sales during a corresponding portion of the current year. If we reject the argument that it is only the law as prevailed on the 1st April of a year that forms,, the basis for the computation of the turnover and for the ascertainment of the tax-liability-as not flowing from the provisions of the Act, and indeed as contrary to the very scheme underlying the enactment, the changes in the law effected during the course of the assessment year must operate even in respect of the turnover of the previous year, which are deemed to be the turnover of the assessment year.
It now remains to deal with the question as to whether the language employed in the notification by which only sales effected after a date specified in the assessment year are to be governed by the new levy, precludes the application of the notified change to those dealers whose sales were actually effected in the previous year, but who had opted for the " previous-year-turnover " basis of assessment. The argument of learned Counsel, which found favour with the learned Judges of the High Court was briefly this. The notification expressly states that only sales effected from and after June 9, 1948, were to be charged with the new rates. In terms therefore, the change in the law is wholly prospective. If so, one cannot by any line of reasoning reach the conclusion that the new rates of levy applied to sales, as by the present respondent, more than a year earlier. So stated the reasoning appears impressive and it is true that a taxing enactment cannot be construed as levying a charge unless the words clearly do so. But the words have always to be understood and more than that applied with reference to the underlying basis of the scheme of taxation. So applied, it does not appear to us to support the contention of the respondent. The change in the rate of tax, was no doubt prospective. The phraseology employed merely means that in the case of the " assessment- year-turnover " dealers only the sale proceeds of sales effected after the specified date would be governed by the new rates. In the case of the " previous-year-turnover "
The date mentioned in the notification as the date from and after which sales would be charged at the new rates would therefore not militate against the new rates being applied to the turnover of the previous year, since the turnover of the previous year has to be assessed on the rates prevailing in the assessment year.
The next question is how on the terms of the notification which came into operation after the commencement of the assessment year and during the course of it, the proportion of the turnover on the basis of which the tax-liability of a previous-year's turnover dealer could be computed. Learned Counsel for the respondent urged that no intelligible basis could be suggested for distinguishing the two periods in the previous year when the original rates and the altered notified rates would operate. Learned Counsel urged that it would be impossible to distinguish these two periods either on any theory of retrospectivity of the notification or on any theory regarding the sales of the previous year being attributed to the corresponding dates of the current year. There is no doubt that this mode of computing the proportion, viz., to treat the sales which were effected on various dates of the previous year, as if they were sales on the corresponding dates of the current year and thus to compute the two totals of turnover which would be subject to different rates of duty would not be proper. The impropriety would arise from the fact that the fiction enacted by s. 7(1) is not that each day's sale in the previous year is deemed to be a sale on the corresponding date in the current year, but only that the total taxable turnover of the previous year is deemed to be that of the current year. The method to which objection is taken is however not the manner in which the Sales-tax Officer computed the proportion which was affirmed by the Judge (Revision). If the total of the sale proceeds of the previous year is deemed to be the total of the current year, there is no illogicality or impropriety in dividing that total in accordance with the number of days in the year in which the different rates prevailed and that is precisely what the Sales-tax Officer did.
If as we hold both the computation of the turnover of the previous year, as well as the incidence of the tax leviable on it, are to be determined not merely by the law as it stood on the first day of the assessment year, but by the law applicable to assessments during the entire assessment year, the method by which the tax-liability of the respondent was computed by the Sales-tax Officer is not open to any objection.
In connection with the interpretation of the notification a minor point was suggested to which brief reference might be made. It was submitted that as the notification in effect levied a tax, if it was ambiguous, it should be resolved in favour of the subject-the tax-payer. We see no ambiguity in the notification to justify an appeal to this rule. Besides the notification in effect frees dealers other than importers and manufacturers of all tax-liability in respect of the sale-turnover of oil, though in the case of two specified classes of dealers. a single point tax at an enhanced rate is levied. In such a situation, the rule of construction invoked could hardly be applied, even if the condition as to ambiguity were present.
We, therefore, hold that the assessment to sales-tax of the respondent company by applying to its turnover of the year 1947-48, the rate of tax specified in the notification of June 8, 1948, as determined by the Sales-tax Officer was in accordance with the law. We would accordingly allow the appeal, set aside the decree of the High Court and restore the assessment order of the Sales-tax Officer with costs here and in the High Court.
BY COURT.-In accordance with the opinion of the majority, the appeal is dismissed with costs.	Total Judgement
