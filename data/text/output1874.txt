1961. December 1. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SARKAR, J.-These four appeals are by landlords whose applications to the authorities under the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948 for possession of the lands held by their tenants, on the grounds had that the tenancy had been terminated by due notices on the tenants' failure to pay rents for three years, were dismissed.
S. 5 (1) No tenancy of any land shall be for a period of less than ten years:	Issue
These authorities refused in three of these cases to make an order for possession either because the tenants had paid up all rent which had fallen in arrear or because the authorities thought it proper on the facts of the case to give them time to pay up. They felt that the tenants were entitled to relief against forfeiture on equitable principles. In the fourth case, which is covered by Civil Appeal No. 259 of 1959, it was held that there had not been on the facts of the case, default in payment of rent for three years and, therefore the tenant was entitled to statutory relief against eviction under s. 25(1) of the Act which we shall later set out.	Facts

The High Court at Bombay by a summary order, without stating any reasons, refused to interfere when moved under Art. 227 of the Constitution. The landlords have therefore filed these appeals with leave of this Court.
x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x S. 14(1) Notwithstanding any agreement, usage, decree, or order of a court of law, the tenancy of any land held by a tenant shall not be terminated unless such tenant:-
x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x Provided that no tenancy of any land held by a tenant shall be terminated on any of the grounds mentioned in this sub-section unless the landlord gives three months' notice in writing intimating the tenant his decision to terminate the tenancy and ground for such termination.
We are not concerned in these three cases with s. 24 mentioned in s. 5(3)(a). The "date fixed" mentioned in s. 14(1)(a)(i) is it may be stated the 20th of March of each year. It is not in dispute in these cases that the tenants were in default in paying rents for three years within s. 14(1)(a)(i) and due notices had been served by the landlords terminating the tenancies as required by the proviso to s. 14(1).
14. In these three cases there is no controversy that the tenancies have been terminated under s.
In our opinion, the authorities were clearly in error in thinking that they could grant relief in these cases on equitable principles. In equity relief may be granted to a tenant who has incurred a forfeiture under the terms of the tenancy, that is, his contract with the landlord. Here, that is not the position. The tenancies have been terminated in these cases under a statutory provision. In the circumstances that have happened, the landlords have in our opinion acquired a statutory right to the possession of the lands and, therefore, to eject the tenants, the reasons for which view we shall discuss in some detail later. In such a case, no relief can be granted to the tenants on equitable principles. Equity does not operate to annul a statute. This appears to us to be well established but we may refer to white and Tudors Leading Cases in Equity (9th ed.) p. 238, where it is stated, "Although, in cases of contract between parties, equity will often relieve against penalties and forfeitures, where compensation can be granted, relief can never be given against the provisions of a statute."
It was then said that s. 29(3) gives ample power to the authorities to refuse to make an order for possession in the landlord's favour if the tenant pays up the arrears and the justice of the case requires that the tenant should not be deprived of the land. That sub-section no doubt says that the Mamlatdar "shall...pass such order thereon as he deems fit". We are however wholly unable to agree that this provision warrants the making of any order that the authority concerned thinks in his individual opinion that the justice of the case requires. We may here refer to R. v. Boteler where a statute which conferred power upon Justices to issue a distress warrant "if they shall think fit" was considered. In that case the Justices had refused to issue the distress warrant. Cockburn C. J. observed, "They went upon the ground that the introduction of this extra-parochial place into the union was a thing unjust in itself; in other words, that the operation of the act of parliament was unjust......I think, therefore it amounts virtually to saying,-'We know that we ought upon all other grounds to issue the warrant, but we will take upon ourselves to say that the law is unjust, and we will not carry out the law'. That is not such an exercise of discretion as this Court will hold, in accordance with the authorities cited, to be one upon which it will act. The Justices must not omit or decline to discharge a duty according to law." We think that is what the authorities in the three cases before us have done. They have refused to carry out the Act because they felt that it worked hardship. They have refused to give to the landlords the relief which the Act said they should have.	Precedent
We now set out the relevant provisions of the Act.
S. 29(1) A tenant or an agricultural labourer or an artisan entitled to possession of any land or dwelling house under any of the provisions of this Act may apply in writing for such possession to the Mamlatdar. x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x (2) No landlord shall obtain possession of any land or dwelling house held by a tenant except under an order of the Mamlatdar. For obtaining such order he shall make an application in the prescribed form and within a period of two years from the date on which the right to obtain possession of the land or dwelling house, as the case may be, is deemed to have accrued to him. (3) On receipt of such application under sub-section (1) or (2) the Mamlatdar shall, after holding an enquiry, pass such order thereon as he deems fit.
By s. 5, therefore, a tenancy under the Act is made to have indefinite duration being renewable for ten years at the end of every ten years and the landlord cannot put an end to the tenancy except under the provisions of the Act, one of which is s. 14. This is irrespective of any contract between the parties. Under s. 14 on the default in payment of a year's rent occurring, the landlord may, if he so chooses, bring the tenancy to end by giving the prescribed notice. If the tenancy is terminated, the tenant has, of course, no right to hold the land. The landlord would then be entitled to recover possession of the land from him. In view however of s. 29(2), the landlord cannot do so except by an application made to a Mamlatdar for the purpose. Now when such an application is made in case where the tenant has been in default for not more than two years, s. 25(1) would have to be applied and the Mamlatdar would have to give the tenant a chance to pay up and thereby annul the termination of the tenancy brought about under s.
The order of the authorities taking away the landlords' statutory right to possession by application of rules of equity cannot be supported.
Now, we feel no doubt that the Act provided that a tenant should be granted relief only in a case where he had not been in arrears with his rents for more than two years; in other words, if he had been in arrears for more than two years he was not to be given any relief against ejectment and the landlord would be entitled to an order for possession. First, we have to point out that the tenancy having been terminated in terms of the statute, the statute would necessarily create a right in the landlord to obtain possession of the demised premises. The tenancy having been terminated, the tenant is not entitled to remain in possession and the only person who would then be entitled to possession would be the landlord. The statute having provided for the termination of the tenancy would by necessary implication create a right in the landlord to recover possession. The statute recognises this right by providing by s. 29(2) for its enforcement by an application to the Mamlatdar. Indeed, s. 29(2) itself mentions this right expressly for it says that the application shall be made within two years from the date on which "the right to obtain possession of the land"	Section
S. 25(1)Where any tenancy of any land held by any tenant is terminated for non- payment of rent and the landlord files any proceeding to eject the tenant, the Mamlatdar shall call upon the tenant to tender to the landlord the rent in arrears together with the costs of the proceeding within fifteen days from the date of order, and if the tenant complies with such order, the Mamlatdar shall, in lieu of making an order for ejectment, pass an order that the tenancy had not been terminated, and thereupon the tenant shall hold the land as if the tenancy had not been terminated:	Conclusion

1961. December 1. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SARKAR, J.-These four appeals are by landlords whose applications to the authorities under the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948 for possession of the lands held by their tenants, on the grounds had that the tenancy had been terminated by due notices on the tenants' failure to pay rents for three years, were dismissed.
These authorities refused in three of these cases to make an order for possession either because the tenants had paid up all rent which had fallen in arrear or because the authorities thought it proper on the facts of the case to give them time to pay up. They felt that the tenants were entitled to relief against forfeiture on equitable principles. In the fourth case, which is covered by Civil Appeal No. 259 of 1959, it was held that there had not been on the facts of the case, default in payment of rent for three years and, therefore the tenant was entitled to statutory relief against eviction under s. 25(1) of the Act which we shall later set out.
The High Court at Bombay by a summary order, without stating any reasons, refused to interfere when moved under Art. 227 of the Constitution. The landlords have therefore filed these appeals with leave of this Court.
We shall now deal with the first three cases and later take up the fourth case. In these three cases relief was granted to the tenants on the basis of certain observation of the High Court at Bombay in Sitaram Vithal Chitnis v. Gundu Satyappa Dhade, Special Civil Application No. 1695 of 1955, unreported, which we quote here: "Every court of equity will be extremely reluctant to enforce an order of ejectment against a tenant when the only ground on which the landlord seeks ejectment is failure to pay rent. Therefore, if the tenant is willing to pay all arrears of rent, in our opinion, it would be inequitable to turn these tenants out when they are prepared to make good the arrears of rent." With great respect to the learned Judges of the High Court, we are unable to assent to the proposition so broadly put.
We now set out the relevant provisions of the Act.
S. 5 (1) No tenancy of any land shall be for a period of less than ten years:
x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x S. 14(1) Notwithstanding any agreement, usage, decree, or order of a court of law, the tenancy of any land held by a tenant shall not be terminated unless such tenant:-
x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x Provided that no tenancy of any land held by a tenant shall be terminated on any of the grounds mentioned in this sub-section unless the landlord gives three months' notice in writing intimating the tenant his decision to terminate the tenancy and ground for such termination.
S. 25(1)Where any tenancy of any land held by any tenant is terminated for non- payment of rent and the landlord files any proceeding to eject the tenant, the Mamlatdar shall call upon the tenant to tender to the landlord the rent in arrears together with the costs of the proceeding within fifteen days from the date of order, and if the tenant complies with such order, the Mamlatdar shall, in lieu of making an order for ejectment, pass an order that the tenancy had not been terminated, and thereupon the tenant shall hold the land as if the tenancy had not been terminated:
S. 29(1) A tenant or an agricultural labourer or an artisan entitled to possession of any land or dwelling house under any of the provisions of this Act may apply in writing for such possession to the Mamlatdar. x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x (2) No landlord shall obtain possession of any land or dwelling house held by a tenant except under an order of the Mamlatdar. For obtaining such order he shall make an application in the prescribed form and within a period of two years from the date on which the right to obtain possession of the land or dwelling house, as the case may be, is deemed to have accrued to him. (3) On receipt of such application under sub-section (1) or (2) the Mamlatdar shall, after holding an enquiry, pass such order thereon as he deems fit.
We are not concerned in these three cases with s. 24 mentioned in s. 5(3)(a). The "date fixed" mentioned in s. 14(1)(a)(i) is it may be stated the 20th of March of each year. It is not in dispute in these cases that the tenants were in default in paying rents for three years within s. 14(1)(a)(i) and due notices had been served by the landlords terminating the tenancies as required by the proviso to s. 14(1).
By s. 5, therefore, a tenancy under the Act is made to have indefinite duration being renewable for ten years at the end of every ten years and the landlord cannot put an end to the tenancy except under the provisions of the Act, one of which is s. 14. This is irrespective of any contract between the parties. Under s. 14 on the default in payment of a year's rent occurring, the landlord may, if he so chooses, bring the tenancy to end by giving the prescribed notice. If the tenancy is terminated, the tenant has, of course, no right to hold the land. The landlord would then be entitled to recover possession of the land from him. In view however of s. 29(2), the landlord cannot do so except by an application made to a Mamlatdar for the purpose. Now when such an application is made in case where the tenant has been in default for not more than two years, s. 25(1) would have to be applied and the Mamlatdar would have to give the tenant a chance to pay up and thereby annul the termination of the tenancy brought about under s.
14. In these three cases there is no controversy that the tenancies have been terminated under s.
14. There is also no dispute that the tenants are not entitled to be relieved against that termination under sub-s. (1) of s. 25 because of the provisions of sub-sec. (2) of that section, as in these cases the rent had not been paid for three years. They however claim relief on the principle on which equity grants relief against forfeiture of tenancies. The authorities under the Act have granted them the relief by applying this equitable principle.
In our opinion, the authorities were clearly in error in thinking that they could grant relief in these cases on equitable principles. In equity relief may be granted to a tenant who has incurred a forfeiture under the terms of the tenancy, that is, his contract with the landlord. Here, that is not the position. The tenancies have been terminated in these cases under a statutory provision. In the circumstances that have happened, the landlords have in our opinion acquired a statutory right to the possession of the lands and, therefore, to eject the tenants, the reasons for which view we shall discuss in some detail later. In such a case, no relief can be granted to the tenants on equitable principles. Equity does not operate to annul a statute. This appears to us to be well established but we may refer to white and Tudors Leading Cases in Equity (9th ed.) p. 238, where it is stated, "Although, in cases of contract between parties, equity will often relieve against penalties and forfeitures, where compensation can be granted, relief can never be given against the provisions of a statute."
The order of the authorities taking away the landlords' statutory right to possession by application of rules of equity cannot be supported.
It was then said that s. 29(3) gives ample power to the authorities to refuse to make an order for possession in the landlord's favour if the tenant pays up the arrears and the justice of the case requires that the tenant should not be deprived of the land. That sub-section no doubt says that the Mamlatdar "shall...pass such order thereon as he deems fit". We are however wholly unable to agree that this provision warrants the making of any order that the authority concerned thinks in his individual opinion that the justice of the case requires. We may here refer to R. v. Boteler where a statute which conferred power upon Justices to issue a distress warrant "if they shall think fit" was considered. In that case the Justices had refused to issue the distress warrant. Cockburn C. J. observed, "They went upon the ground that the introduction of this extra-parochial place into the union was a thing unjust in itself; in other words, that the operation of the act of parliament was unjust......I think, therefore it amounts virtually to saying,-'We know that we ought upon all other grounds to issue the warrant, but we will take upon ourselves to say that the law is unjust, and we will not carry out the law'. That is not such an exercise of discretion as this Court will hold, in accordance with the authorities cited, to be one upon which it will act. The Justices must not omit or decline to discharge a duty according to law." We think that is what the authorities in the three cases before us have done. They have refused to carry out the Act because they felt that it worked hardship. They have refused to give to the landlords the relief which the Act said they should have.
Now, we feel no doubt that the Act provided that a tenant should be granted relief only in a case where he had not been in arrears with his rents for more than two years; in other words, if he had been in arrears for more than two years he was not to be given any relief against ejectment and the landlord would be entitled to an order for possession.
