CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION Criminal Appeal No. 56 of 1959.
Appeal by special leave. from the judgment and order dated- December 18, 1957, of the former Bombay High Court in Criminal Revision No. 1671 of 1957, arising out of the judgment and order dated June 7, 1957, of the Sessions Judge, Baroda, in Criminal Appeal No. 33 of 1957. H. B. Khanna and D. Gupta, for the appellant. G. C. Mathur, for the respondent.
1960. August 31. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by AYYANGAR J.-This appeal by special leave of this Court raises a very short point regarding the construction of s. 20(1) of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 (37 of 1954).
The respondent owned a milk shop within the Municipal limits of the city of Baroda. The Food Inspector of the Municipality visited the shop on July 9, 1956 and purchased milk for analysis. This was sent to the Public Analyst and when his report was to the effect that the sample was adulterated, the Inspector applied to the Chief Officer, Borough Municipality, Baroda, for the latter's consent, for instituting criminal proceedings under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 (referred to hereafter as the Act), against the respondent. A consent in writing to the initiation of this prosecution was given by the Chief Officer and thereafter the complaint out of which this appeal arises was instituted charging the respondent with an offence under s. 16 read with s. 7 of the Act for selling adulterated food.
The case was tried by the Special Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Baroda. Besides denying his guilt, the accused raised various technical objections, the principal of which was that the prosecution was incompetent because of non- compliance with the terms of s. 20(1) of the Act. This provision, omitting the proviso to which it is unnecessary to refer, runs:
The Magistrate overruled these objections and holding the accused guilty of the offence charged sentenced him to pay a fine of Rs. 300/- and in default to rigorous imprisonment for three months. Dealing with the objection based on s. 20(1) of the Act with which alone we are concerned, the learned Magistrate said:
Against his conviction and sentence the respondent filed an appeal to the Court of the Sessions Judge at Baroda. The Appellate Court set aside the order of conviction and sentence on the ground that the Food Inspector was not competent to institute the prosecution under s. 20(1) of the Act. Relying on the decision of a single Judge of the Madras High Court in Cannanore Milk Supply Co-operative Society, In re(1), the learned Sessions Judge held that under the terms of the section, the only authority with whose " written consent " a prosecution could be instituted was the State Government and that neither " the local autho- rity " nor " the person authorized in that behalf by the (1) (1956) 2 M.L.J. 465.
State Government or the local authority " were competent to grant " written consents " for the initiation of prosecutions. He, therefore, set aside the conviction and sentence and discharged the respondent.
The matter was thereafter brought up before the High Court of Bombay by the State by an appeal later converted into a Criminal Revision petition. The learned Judges of the High Court affirmed the order passed by the learned Sessions Judge. They disagreed with the Sessions Judge in his interpretation of s. 20(1) that a prosecution could not be instituted with " the written consent" of any authority other than the State Government. They, however, held that "
consent " is in the following terms:
The name of the respondent, his address and the date of the offence are then set out and it is followed by a paragraph which runs:
We may, at the outset, point out that we entirely agree with the learned Judges of the High Court in their view that on the terms of a. 20(1) a prosecution could be instituted with the written consent not merely of the State Government but "
Even apart from-the two commas, the construction which found favour with the learned Judge of the Madras High Court in Cannanore Milk Supply Cooperative Society, In re (1) is not possible without the sub-section being rewritten in these terms:
Without the insertion of the word " by " before the words "
As already stated, the reasoning, however, by which the learned Judges of the High Court held the prosecution to be incompetent was that " the written consent " did not in terms, name the person " in whose favour " the sanction or "
The learned Counsel for the appellant-State challenged the correctness of this construction. He referred us to the analogy of the decisions rendered on s. 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code where it has been held that " the sanction "
which are specified in the provision as competent by themselves to initiate prosecutions, persons " authorised by " these two authorities are further included. The expression " person authorised in this behalf " obviously refers to a named person who is so authorized. In the case of these four categories, the authority or person filing the complaint has itself or himself to consider the reasonableness and propriety of the prosecution and be satisfied that the prosecution is not frivolous and is called for. Turning next to the other class, the relevant words are " no prosecution shall be instituted except with the written consent of Here the emphasis is on the consent to the filing of the prosecution, not to the person filing it. The preliminary examination of the facts to ascertain the desirability and propriety of the prosecution is in this last case, the responsibility of the person or authority giving the written consent-not of the person who figures as the complainant. The two classes are distinct and the employment of different phraseology to designate the two types of devolution of authority, constitutes an indication that in the second class of cases-where prosecutions are filed on the basis of written consents granted by the competent person or authority, the specification of the name of the complainant is not a statutory requirement-the consent being to a specified prosecution. We, therefore,, consider that the prosecution in the present case was instituted on a complaint which fulfilled the requirements of s. 20(1) of the Act.
One part of the reasoning of the learned Judges of the High Court was, that in the absence of persons being named in the written consent, a complaint might be lodged by persons over whom " the local authority " would have no control and that for this reason it was necessary to adopt the construction which they did of s. 20(1), namely, that the written consent should name the person authorized to file the complaint. In our opinion, this apprehension is not justified, for the written consent has to be filed by the complainant in order to enable the complaint to be entertained, and it is not as if the written consent will be available to all and sundry to be filed before the Magistrate. Besides, even on the reasoning of the learned Judges of the High Court there is no restriction as to the person who might be named as authorised to file the complaint. Normally,, of course, the person named would be an officer of the Municipality, but theoretically there is a possibility that the person named might not be a Municipal servant, and if " the written consent" is in favour of such a person, the Municipal authority would have no administrative control over him. The complication referred to by the learned Judges would still be there, even though a person be named in the written consent given by the local authority. We, therefore,, consider that this is not a circumstance which of necessity leads to the construction that the complainant ought to be named in the written consent under s. 20(1). The respondent was not represented before this Court, and in view of the importance of the matter, Mr. G. C. Mathur was requested by the Court to appear as amicus-curiae and we express our thanks to him for the assistance he rendered us. The appeal is accordingly allowed, the order of the High Court is set aside, and that of the Magistrate restored.
