CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 28 of 1956.
Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated June 21, 1954, of the Calcutta High Court in Criminal Revision No. 811 of 1953.	Issue
Ranadeb Chaudhury and P. K. Chatterjee, for the appellants. B. Sen and P. K. Bose, for the respondents. 1958. September 11. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR J.-This appeal by special leave raises a question of interpretation of s. 237 of the Indian Companies Act. Appellant No. 1 is One of the past directors of the Bank of Commerce Ltd., now in liquidation and appellant No. 2 was its Managing Director. The Bank was ordered to be wound up by the High Court of Calcutta on August 7, 1950, and one G. K. Dutt, Bar-at-law was appointed its Official Liquidator but on September 7, 1950, the Official Receiver was appointed in place of Dutt. On July 23, 1952, respondent No. 1 filed in Court of the Presidency Magistrate a complaint against the appellant under ss. 120B, 406, 467, 477A, Indian Penal Code and 182A of the Indian Companies Act and stated that he was doing so under the authority of the official liquidator and the official liquidator had obtained the directions of the High Court to file the complaint. On May 5, 1953, the appellant applied to the I-residency Magistrate for dismissal of the complaint as being without the sanction of the Company Judge and therefore the official liquidator in his official capacity was incompetent to prefer the complaint, being the creation of the statute he could only act within the four corners of the statute. He possessed only those powers which the statute conferred on him. This application was dismissed by the Presidency Magistrate on June 13, 1953.
The passage already quoted from the judgment of the learned Chief Justice shows that all the relevant facts were before the Company Judge, as they were all set out in the affidavits placed before him. The complaint was then filed on July 23, 1952. During the pendency of the complaint the appellants took an appeal against the order of the Company Judge dated July 22, 1952, but it was dismissed on the objection taken by the liquidator that it was an administrative order and not a judicial order. On August 5, 1953, the official liquidator took out misfeasance proceedings under s. 235 of the Companies Act and the appellants then applied to the High Court for quashing the criminal proceedings already started on the ground of commencement of proceedings under s. 235. This application was also heard with the rule which was issued on June 29, 1953, and it was dismissed by the same judgment by which the rule was discharged, i. e., of June 21, 1954. The general scheme of the Companies Act is that the Court should have complete control of all proceedings in winding up and it was therefore urged that the official liquidator was not authorised to do anything either without the sanction of the Court or without its directions. Section 179 deals with the powers of official liquidator. It provides:	Facts
The form at p. 607 does not show that under the English Companies Act when liberty is given to prosecute the person accused is heard. All that is required is that the court will make its order upon affidavits etc. filed before it and it can also order that the costs and charges incurred by the liquidator shall be paid out of the assets of the company. It was next contended that although the language of s. 237 was not in the negative form still the effect of the words was that no prosecution could be instituted without the sanction of the Court being obtained by the liquidator. In support of the submission counsel (1) (1883) 31 W.R. 546.	PetArg
The appellant then applied to the High Court for quashing the criminal proceedings on the ground that the prosecution was ab initio void because of the absence of prior direction judicially given by the High Court under s. 237(1) of the Indian Companies Act. The High Court found against the appellants and discharged the rule. The learned Chief Justice held that the provisions of s. 237(1) are no bar to a prosecution by the liquidator; that under s. 237(1) there is nothing in the nature of a judicial proceedings that it could not be said that the order was not a valid direction under s. 237(1). He said:
On the application of the official liquidator Bachawat J. an January 15, 1951, made an order which must be taken to be one under s. 179. In this order it was said:
Mr. Choudhuri then relied on certain English cases dealing with the mode of giving directions. In re Northern Counties Bank Limited(1) the Judge had ordered the liquidator to ascertain by circular the wishes of the creditors and after they had appeared to oppose the starting of the prosecution, it was held (1) that it did not sufficiently appear that the offence had been committed and (2) that as 2/3 of the creditors opposed the application the prosecution should not be ordered as expenses will have to be paid from out of the money belonging to the creditors. The main question for decision in that case was whether the prosecution should be at the cost and expense of the assets of the company but competency of the liquidator to file the complaint was not in dispute. Reference 'was then made to Palmer's Company Precedents, 1952 Edition, Vol. II, again stating as to when leave to prosecute should be given but the law stated there does not support the case for the appellants. At page 605 it is stated :
relied on The Queen v. Cubitt (1) which was a case under the Sea Fisheries Act which created certain offences and by s. 11 provided:
On the other hand it has been held that under s. 179 of the Indian Companies Act no sanction is required for commencing a prosecution. In Jaswantrai Manilal Akhaney v. The State of Bombay (1) at the instance of the official liquidator a report was lodged with the police against the Managing Director of a Bank and the police submitted a charge sheet to the Magistrate. It was observed by Sinha J. at page 502:
It was also pointed out in this judgment that s. 179 contains no words corresponding to the language of Drug Control Order, 1943, which was held to be a condition precedent for instituting prosecution in the case of Basdeo Aggarwalla v. King Emperor (2) nor are there any prohibitory words like those that are contained in ss. 196 and 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code. In the former case no prosecution could be instituted without the previous sanction of the Provincial Government and the latter provides that " no court shall take cognizance................... There are two cases decided by two Indian High Courts which support the submission of the respondents' counsel.
In Emperor v. Bishan Sahai (3) it was held that the Companies Act nowhere provides that without the directions of a Judge no criminal prosecution can be instituted. In Mrityunjoy Chakravarti v. Provot Kumar Pal(4), it was held that neither s. 179 nor s. 237 indicates that if the liquidator takes action without a (1) [1956] S.C.R. 483.
direction of the Court this action would be illegal or invalid or it would invalidate a prosecution. It would thus appear that both on the language of s. 237(1) as well as on precedent the complaint made by the liquidator against the appellants suffers from no such infirmity as to make the proceedings null and void. The section contains no such words which indicate that such a prosecution cannot be instituted by a liquidator without the sanction of the Judge or that the Court cannot take cognizance of a complaint without such sanction or direction. Section 179 as the learned Chief Justice of Calcutta High Court has rightly pointed out, deals with the powers of liquidators to institute or defend proceedings with the sanction of the Court and s. 237(1) deals with the powers of the Court to give directions for prosecution of delinquent directors, etc. It was further urged on behalf of the respondents that in the case before us there was a proper direction under s. 237(1). The judgment of the High Court shows that before the learned Judge gave a direction on July 22, 1952, there were before him proper materials and, therefore, his sanction was perfectly valid, legal and proper. Before this order made by Bannerji J. there was an order of Bachawat J. dated January 15, 1951, under s. 179 and, therefore, when the liquidator authorised his Assistant, respondent No. 1 to institute the proceedings he was entitled to do so. As we have said above even in the absence of such directions the legality of the criminal proceedings instituted would not be affected.	Precedent
He also held that clause (a) of s. 179 empowers the liquidator to institute or defend legal proceedings in the name of the company and that it was expressly concerned with the powers of' the liquidator whereas s. 237 dealt with the powers of the Court to give, directions. P. B. Mukherji J. gave a concurring judgment. After referring to the history of s. 237, he held that under that section the Company Judge can act ex parte and it was not necessary for him to hear a director or an officer of the company com- plained against and that direction given under that section was not a condition precedent to a prosecution by the official liquidator nor is it the intention of that section to impinge on the powers of a criminal court under the Code of Criminal Procedure. Leave to appeal having been refused by the Calcutta High Court, the appellants have come to this Court in pursuance of special leave.
Under s. 180 the Court may provide that the official liquidator may exercise any of the powers given under s. 179 without the sanction or intervention of the Court. Section 183 deals with the exercise and control of liquidator's powers. Sub-section 3 authorises him to apply to the Court for directions in relation to any particular matter arising in the winding up. Subsection 4 is a provision under which the official liquidator is entitled to use his own discretion in the administration of the assets of the company and in the distribution amongst the creditors. Sub- section 5 provides:
These provisions show that s. 179 deals with the powers of the liquidator.
Under s. 235 the Court has the power to assess damages against delinquent directors and the Court may on the application of the liquidator or a creditor or a contributory examine into the conduct of a director and compel him to pay or restore money or property or to contribute such sum to the assets of the company by way of compensation in respect of any misfeasance on his part and this power may be exercised irrespective of the criminal liability of the director. Section 237 deals with prosecution of delinquent director and the relevant portion of this section is:
criminal proceedings by private prosecutors. Merely because no such provision has been made in regard to scotland does not affect the argument.	Section
(2) [1945] F.C.R. 93.
(3) I.L.R. (1937) All. 779.
(4) A.I.R. 1953 Cal. 153.
Nothing that we have said in this judgment must be taken to be an expression of opinion which in any way affects the control by the Judge of proceedings in winding up or over the liquidators.
We would, therefore, dismiss this appeal. Appeal dismissed.	Conclusion
CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 28 of 1956.
Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated June 21, 1954, of the Calcutta High Court in Criminal Revision No. 811 of 1953.
Ranadeb Chaudhury and P. K. Chatterjee, for the appellants. B. Sen and P. K. Bose, for the respondents. 1958. September 11. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR J.-This appeal by special leave raises a question of interpretation of s. 237 of the Indian Companies Act.

The High Court found against the appellants and discharged the rule.

Leave to appeal having been refused by the Calcutta High Court, the appellants have come to this Court in pursuance of special leave.
On the application of the official liquidator Bachawat J. an January 15, 1951, made an order which must be taken to be one under s. 179. In this order it was said:
The passage already quoted from the judgment of the learned Chief Justice shows that all the relevant facts were before the Company Judge, as they were all set out in the affidavits placed before him. The complaint was then filed on July 23, 1952. During the pendency of the complaint the appellants took an appeal against the order of the Company Judge dated July 22, 1952, but it was dismissed on the objection taken by the liquidator that it was an administrative order and not a judicial order.

This application was also heard with the rule which was issued on June 29, 1953, and it was dismissed by the same judgment by which the rule was discharged, i. e., of June 21, 1954. The general scheme of the Companies Act is that the Court should have complete control of all proceedings in winding up and it was therefore urged that the official liquidator was not authorised to do anything either without the sanction of the Court or without its directions. Section 179 deals with the powers of official liquidator. It provides:
Under s. 180 the Court may provide that the official liquidator may exercise any of the powers given under s. 179 without the sanction or intervention of the Court. Section 183 deals with the exercise and control of liquidator's powers. Sub-section 3 authorises him to apply to the Court for directions in relation to any particular matter arising in the winding up. Subsection 4 is a provision under which the official liquidator is entitled to use his own discretion in the administration of the assets of the company and in the distribution amongst the creditors. Sub- section 5 provides:
These provisions show that s. 179 deals with the powers of the liquidator.
Under s. 235 the Court has the power to assess damages against delinquent directors and the Court may on the application of the liquidator or a creditor or a contributory examine into the conduct of a director and compel him to pay or restore money or property or to contribute such sum to the assets of the company by way of compensation in respect of any misfeasance on his part and this power may be exercised irrespective of the criminal liability of the director. Section 237 deals with prosecution of delinquent director and the relevant portion of this section is:
criminal proceedings by private prosecutors. Merely because no such provision has been made in regard to scotland does not affect the argument.
Mr. Choudhuri then relied on certain English cases dealing with the mode of giving directions. In re Northern Counties Bank Limited(1) the Judge had ordered the liquidator to ascertain by circular the wishes of the creditors and after they had appeared to oppose the starting of the prosecution, it was held (1) that it did not sufficiently appear that the offence had been committed and (2) that as 2/3 of the creditors opposed the application the prosecution should not be ordered as expenses will have to be paid from out of the money belonging to the creditors.

It was next contended that although the language of s. 237 was not in the negative form still the effect of the words was that no prosecution could be instituted without the sanction of the Court being obtained by the liquidator. In support of the submission counsel (1) (1883) 31 W.R. 546.
relied on The Queen v. Cubitt (1) which was a case under the Sea Fisheries Act which created certain offences and by s. 11 provided:

direction of the Court this action would be illegal or invalid or it would invalidate a prosecution. It would thus appear that both on the language of s. 237(1) as well as on precedent the complaint made by the liquidator against the appellants suffers from no such infirmity as to make the proceedings null and void.

We would, therefore, dismiss this appeal. Appeal dismissed.	Total Judgement
