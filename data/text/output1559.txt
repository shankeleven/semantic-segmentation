The State Of Maharashtra vs Vishnu Ramchandra on 18 October, 1960	Case Title
CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 78 of 1959.
Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated November 25, 1958, of the former Bombay High Court in Criminal Revision Application No. 1393 of 1958 arising out of the judgment and order dated September 18, 1958, of the Presidency Magistrate 11 Class, Mazagaon at Bombay in Case No. 1101/P of 1958.
1960. October 18. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by HIDAYATULLAH J.-This is an appeal by the State of Bombay, with the special leave of this Court, against the order of acquittal by the High Court of Bombay of the respondent, Vishnu Ramchandra, who was prosecuted under s. 142 of the Bombay Police Act and sentenced to six months' rigorous im- prisonment by the Presidency Magistrate, 2nd Court, Mazagaon, Bombay.	Issue
On November 16, 1949, Vishnu Ramehandra was convicted under s. 380 and 114 of the Indian Penal Code, and sentenced to one month's rigorous imprisonment. On October 15, 1957, the Deputy 'Commissioner of Police, Bombay, acting under s. 57(a) of the Bombay Police Act (22 of 1951), passed an order against Vishnu Ramchandra which was to operate for one year, externing him from the limits of Greater Bombay. At that time, a prosecution under s. 411 of the Indian Penal Code was pending against Vishnu Ramchandra, and he was not immediately externed, to enable him to attend the case. This prosecution came to an end on July 10, 1958, and resulted in his acquittal. Immediately afterwards, a constable took him outside the limits of Greater Bombay, and left him there. The prosecution case was that he returned to Greater Bombay, and was arrested at Pydhonie on August 24, 1958. He was prosecuted under s. 142 of the Bombay Police Act. His plea that he was forcibly brought back to Pydhonie and arrested was not accepted by the Presidency Magistrate, and he was convicted.
He filed a revision application, which was heard by a learned single Judge of the High Court of Bombay. Three contentions were raised before the High Court. The first was that the Deputy Commissioner of Police had not applied his mind to the facts of the case before making the order of externment. The second was that s. 57 of the Bombay Police Act was prospective, and could not be made applicable, unless the conviction on which the action of externment was based, took place after the coming into force of that Act. The third was that the belief entertained by the Deputy Commissioner that Vishnu Ramchandra was likely to engage himself in the commission of an offence similar to that for which he was prosecuted was based on the prosecution which was then pending, and that that ground disappeared after his acquittal. The High Court did not consider the first and the third grounds, because it held that the second ground was good.	Facts

The respondent did not appear.	RespArg
In reaching his conclusion the learned single Judge observed that the legislature had used the present participle " has been " and not the past participle in the opening portion of the section, and that this indicated that the section was intended to be used only where a person was convicted subsequent to the coming into force of the Act. He further observed that being a penal section, it had to be interpreted prospectively. He repelled an argument of the Assistant Government Pleader that s. 57 merely re-enacted the provisions of s. 27 of the City of Bombay Police Act, 1902, and that a liability incurred under the older Act was preserved by s. 167 of the Bombay Police Act of 1951. Observing further that the Deputy Commissioner of Police at the time of the passing of the order could not be said to have entertained a belief about the activities of Vishnu Ramchandra based upon his conviction in the year 1949, he held that the order of externment must be regarded as invalid for that reason and also on the ground that the conviction was not after the coming into force of the Act. At the hearing before us, the respondent was not represented. We have heard Mr. Dhebar in support of the appeal, and, in our opinion, the High Court was not right in the view it had taken of s. 57 of the Act. The question whether an enactment is meant to operate prospectively or retrospectively has to be decided in accordance with well- settled principles. The cardinal principle is that statutes must always be interpreted prospectively, unless the language of the statutes makes them retrospective, either expressly or by necessary implication. Penal statutes which create new offences are always prospective, but penal statutes which create disabilities, though ordinarily interpreted prospectively, are sometimes interpreted retrospectively when there is a clear intendment that they are to be applied to past events. The reason why penal statutes are so construed was stated by Erle, C. J., in Midland Rly. Co. v. Pye (1) in the following words:
This principle has now been recognised by our Constitution and established as a Constitutional restriction on legislative power.
(1) 10 C.B. (N.S.) 179, 191.
There are, however, statutes which create Do new punishment, but authorise some action based on past conduct. To such statutes, if expressed in language showing retrospective operation, the principle is not applied. As Lord Coleridge, C. J., observed during the course of arguments in Rex v. Birthwhistle (1):
Another principle which also applies is that an Act designed to protect the public against acts of a harmful character may be construed retrospectively, if the language admits such an interpretation, even though it may equally have a prospective meaning. In Queen v. Vine (2), which dealt with the disqualification of persons selling spirits by retail if convicted of felony, the Act was applied retrospectively to persons who were convicted before the Act came into operation. Cock burn, C. J., observed:-
to import the intention to protect the public against persons convicted in the past as well as in future; the words are in effect equivalent to 'every convicted felon'." In the same case, Archibald, J., expressed himself forcefully when he observed:-
Similarly, in Ex Parte Pratt (1), which dealt with the words " a debtor commits an act of bankruptcy " to enable the Court to make a receiving order, Cotton, L. J., gave the words a retrospective operation, observing:--
In the same case, the observations of Bowen, L. J., were:-
Fry, L. J., added :-
In Bourke v. Nutt (2), Lord Esher, M. R., speaking of these observations of Bowen and Fry, LL. J., observed :-
which the Court has to act, and not the time at which the condition of things on which it has to act came into existence."
Applying the above principles, Lord Esher, M. R., held that the section was not retrospective but prospective, because the important time was that at which it had to be considered whether the person was disqualified and it related to a time after the passing of the Act. He, however, added that "
These principles, though not unanimously expressed, have been accepted in later cases both in England and in India. In Ganesan v. A. K. Joscelyne (1), Chakravarti, C. J., observed, Sarkar, J. (as he then was), concurring:-
In Taher Saifuddin v. Tyebbhai Moosaji (2), the same principles were applied by Chagla, C. J. and Bhagwati, J. (as he then was), and reference was made also to The Queen v. Inhabitants of St. Mary Whitechapel (3) where Lord Denman, C. J., in his judgment observed:-	Precedent
Section 57 of the Bombay Police Act reads as follows:
the Act passed, and that the presumption against a retrospective statute being intended supported this construction; but we have before shown that the statute is in its direct operation prospective, as it relates to future removals only, and that it is not properly called a retrospective statute because a part of the requisites for its action is drawn from time antecedent to its passing." Now s. 57 of the Bombay Police Act, 1951, does not create a new offence nor makes punishable that which was not an offence. It is designed to protect the public from the activities of undesirable persons who have been convicted of offences of a particular kind. The section only enables the authorities to take note of their convictions and to put them outside the area of their activities, so that the public may be protected against a repetition of such activities. As observed by Phillimore, J., in Rex v. Austin (1), "No man has such a vested right in his past crimes and their consequences as would entitle him to insist that in no future legislation shall any regard whatever be had to his previous history."
An offender who has been punished may be restrained in his- acts and conduct by some legislation, which takes note of his antecedents; but so long as the action taken against him is after the Act comes into force, the statute cannot be said to be applied retrospectively. The Act in question was thus not applied retrospectively but prospectively. It remains only to consider if the language of the section bars an action based on past actions before the Act was passed. The verb "has been" is in the present perfect tense, and may mean either " shall have been " or " shall be ". Looking, however, to the scheme of the enactment as a whole and particularly the other portions of it, it is manifest that the former meaning is intended. The verb "	Section

Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated November 25, 1958, of the former Bombay High Court in Criminal Revision Application No. 1393 of 1958 arising out of the judgment and order dated September 18, 1958, of the Presidency Magistrate 11 Class, Mazagaon at Bombay in Case No. 1101/P of 1958.

1960. October 18. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by HIDAYATULLAH J.-This is an appeal by the State of Bombay, with the special leave of this Court, against the order of acquittal by the High Court of Bombay of the respondent, Vishnu Ramchandra, who was prosecuted under s. 142 of the Bombay Police Act and sentenced to six months' rigorous im- prisonment by the Presidency Magistrate, 2nd Court, Mazagaon, Bombay.
On November 16, 1949, Vishnu Ramehandra was convicted under s. 380 and 114 of the Indian Penal Code, and sentenced to one month's rigorous imprisonment. On October 15, 1957, the Deputy 'Commissioner of Police, Bombay, acting under s. 57(a) of the Bombay Police Act (22 of 1951), passed an order against Vishnu Ramchandra which was to operate for one year, externing him from the limits of Greater Bombay. At that time, a prosecution under s. 411 of the Indian Penal Code was pending against Vishnu Ramchandra, and he was not immediately externed, to enable him to attend the case. This prosecution came to an end on July 10, 1958, and resulted in his acquittal. Immediately afterwards, a constable took him outside the limits of Greater Bombay, and left him there. The prosecution case was that he returned to Greater Bombay, and was arrested at Pydhonie on August 24, 1958. He was prosecuted under s. 142 of the Bombay Police Act. His plea that he was forcibly brought back to Pydhonie and arrested was not accepted by the Presidency Magistrate, and he was convicted.
He filed a revision application, which was heard by a learned single Judge of the High Court of Bombay. Three contentions were raised before the High Court. The first was that the Deputy Commissioner of Police had not applied his mind to the facts of the case before making the order of externment. The second was that s. 57 of the Bombay Police Act was prospective, and could not be made applicable, unless the conviction on which the action of externment was based, took place after the coming into force of that Act. The third was that the belief entertained by the Deputy Commissioner that Vishnu Ramchandra was likely to engage himself in the commission of an offence similar to that for which he was prosecuted was based on the prosecution which was then pending, and that that ground disappeared after his acquittal. The High Court did not consider the first and the third grounds, because it held that the second ground was good.
Section 57 of the Bombay Police Act reads as follows:
In reaching his conclusion the learned single Judge observed that the legislature had used the present participle " has been " and not the past participle in the opening portion of the section, and that this indicated that the section was intended to be used only where a person was convicted subsequent to the coming into force of the Act. He further observed that being a penal section, it had to be interpreted prospectively. He repelled an argument of the Assistant Government Pleader that s. 57 merely re-enacted the provisions of s. 27 of the City of Bombay Police Act, 1902, and that a liability incurred under the older Act was preserved by s. 167 of the Bombay Police Act of 1951. Observing further that the Deputy Commissioner of Police at the time of the passing of the order could not be said to have entertained a belief about the activities of Vishnu Ramchandra based upon his conviction in the year 1949, he held that the order of externment must be regarded as invalid for that reason and also on the ground that the conviction was not after the coming into force of the Act. At the hearing before us, the respondent was not represented. We have heard Mr. Dhebar in support of the appeal, and, in our opinion, the High Court was not right in the view it had taken of s. 57 of the Act. The question whether an enactment is meant to operate prospectively or retrospectively has to be decided in accordance with well- settled principles. The cardinal principle is that statutes must always be interpreted prospectively, unless the language of the statutes makes them retrospective, either expressly or by necessary implication. Penal statutes which create new offences are always prospective, but penal statutes which create disabilities, though ordinarily interpreted prospectively, are sometimes interpreted retrospectively when there is a clear intendment that they are to be applied to past events. The reason why penal statutes are so construed was stated by Erle, C. J., in Midland Rly. Co. v. Pye (1) in the following words:

There are, however, statutes which create Do new punishment, but authorise some action based on past conduct. To such statutes, if expressed in language showing retrospective operation, the principle is not applied. As Lord Coleridge, C. J., observed during the course of arguments in Rex v. Birthwhistle (1):

Now s. 57 of the Bombay Police Act, 1951, does not create a new offence nor makes punishable that which was not an offence. It is designed to protect the public from the activities of undesirable persons who have been convicted of offences of a particular kind. The section only enables the authorities to take note of their convictions and to put them outside the area of their activities, so that the public may be protected against a repetition of such activities.
