CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeals Nos. 290 to 292 of 1959.
Appeals by special leave from the judgment and order dated December 6, 1957, of the Kerala High Court in Agricultural Income-tax Referred Cases Nos. 15, 18 and 19 of 1955. C.K. Daphtary, Solicitor-General of India, Thomas Vellapally and M. R. K. Pillai, for the appellants (in all the appeals) Sardar Bahadur, for the respondents.
1960. December 15. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR, J.-These three appeals are brought by special leave against the judgment and order of the High Court of Kerala and arise out of a common judgment of that court given in three Agricultural Income-tax References Nos. 15, 18 and 19 of 1955. In the first reference the question raised was:
and in the other two the question referred was:
In all the references the questions were answered in the negative and against the appellant.
The appeals relate to three accounting years 1950, 1951 and 1952 (assessment years 1951-52, 1952-53 and 1953-54). The appellants have rubber plantations and in the accounting year 1950, corresponding to the assessment year 1951-52, the appellants had under cultivation 3558-84 acres out of which 334-64 acres had immature rubber trees growing and the rest i.e. 3224-20 acres mature rubber yielding trees under cultivation. In that year a sum of Rs. 19,056-0-9, which was expended for the upkeep and maintenance of immature portion of the rubber plantation, was allowed by the Agricultural Income tax Tribunal and at the instance of the respondent a reference was made to the High Court under s. 60(1) of the Agricultural Income tax Act (Act XXII of 1950) hereinafter termed the 'Act' and that was reference No. 18 of 1955.
During the accounting year 1951 corresponding to the assessment year 1952-53 the appellant had under cultivation. a total area of 3426,55 acres of which 3091.91acres were mature rubber yielding trees and 334.64 acres had immature rubber trees. In that year a sum of Rs. 59,271.9-5 was the expenditure incurred for the upkeep and maintenance of immature portion of the rubber estate. That sum was allowed by the Agricultural Income-tax Tribunal and at the instance of the respondent a reference was made under s. 60(1) of the Act to the High Court and that was reference No. 19 of 1955. In Agricultural Income-tax Reference No. 15 of 1955 which related to, accounting year 1952 and the assessment year 1953-54, the area under cultivation was 3453,65 out of which 2967,91 acres had mature rubber yielding trees and 485,74 acres had immature rubber growing trees. In that year the amount expended on the maintenance and tending of the imma- ture rubber trees was Rs. 42,660,4-1. In that case, however, the Agricultural Income tax Tribunal rejected the appellant's claim and disallowed the expenditure. At the instance of the appellant a case was stated to the High Court under s. 60(1) of the Act and was answered in the negative and against the appellant. In all the cases the assessee company is the appellant and the main question for decision is whether the amount expended for the upkeep and maintenance of the immature, rubber trees is a permissible deduction under s. 5(j) of the Act.
The charging section under the Act is s. 3 and s. 5 relates to computation of agricultural income. It provides:-
whether certain payments made were by way of capital expenditure or revenue expenditure. The assessee acquired a lease from Government for twenty years and in addition to paying the rent and royalties for the lease the assessee had to pay two further sums as 'protection fees' under the terms of the lease. Those sums were held to be capital expenditure inasmuch as they were incurred for the acquisition of an asset or an advantage of enduring nature and were no part of the working or operational expenses for carrying on the business of the assessee. In our opinion the amount expended on the superintendence, weeding etc. of the whole estate should have been allowed against the profits earned and it is no answer to the claim for a deduction that part of those expenses produced no return in that year because all the trees were not yielding rubber in that year.
We therefore allow these appeals, set aside the judgments and orders of the High Court and answer the questions in favour of the appellant in all the three agricultural Income-tax References. The appellant will have its costs in this Court and the High Court. One hearing fee in this Court.
Appeals allowed.
