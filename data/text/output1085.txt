Bala Subrahmanya Rajaram vs B.C. Patil And Others on 19 March, 1958	Case Title
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeals Nos. 35 & 36 of 1954.
Appeals from the judgments and order dated August 28, 1952, of the Bombay High Court in Appeals Nos. 34 and 35 of 1952, arising out of the orders dated January 24, 1952, of the said High Court exercising its Civil Original Jurisdiction in Misc. Applications Nos. 302 of 1951 and 303, 304 and 305 of 1951 respectively.
The second, third, fourth and fifth respondents are employees in the Mills.
The third respondent thereupon made an application before the first respondent, the Authority under the Payment of Wages Act.	Issue
1958. March 19. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BOSE J.-These appeals arise out of petitions made to the Bombay High Court under Art. 226 for writs of certiorari. The appellant is the manager of the Tata Mills Limited, which carries on business in the manufacture and sale of textile goods in Bombay and as such is responsible for the payment of wages under the Payment of Wages Act, 1936. The first respondent was the Authority under the Payment of Wages Act at the times material to these appeals. The sixth respondent is the present Authority. The Authority is entrusted with the duty of deciding cases falling within the purview of the Act.
Those operatives who made a claim before the date fixed above were duly paid but payment was refused to the third respondent, who applied much later, on the ground that the condition subject to which the award was made was not fulfilled.
Similar claims were made by the second, fourth and fifth respondents for a bonus for the year 1949. The, Industrial Court awarded a bonus equal to two months' wages and in the sixth condition put the date as December 31, 1950. By this time Labour Appellate Tribunals came into existence, so both sides filed appeals against the award to the Labour Appellate Tribunal of Bombay. The appeals failed and the award was upheld.	Facts
After that, the matter followed the same pattern. Respondents 2, 4 and 5 applied for their bonus after December 31, 1950. The Mills refused to pay and these respondents applied to the first respondent, the Authority under the Payment of Wages Act.
The two sets of claims, that is to say, the claim of the third respondent for a bonus for the year 1948 and the claims of the second, fourth and fifth respondents for bonuses for the year 1949, were heard together. The appellant contested these applications on two grounds. He questioned the jurisdiction of the Authority to entertain the petitions made to it. He also contended that, in any event, as the condition subject to which the award was made, namely, an application on or before November 30, 1949, was not fulfilled, the claim for a bonus did not lie. The first respondent held that it had jurisdiction and, after hearing the parties on the merits, decreed the various claims.

A dispute arose about a claim made by the operatives of the Mills for a bonus for the year 1948. This was referred to the Industrial Court at Bombay which made an award on April 23, 1949, and awarded a bonus equivalent to four and a half months' wages subject to certain conditions of which only the sixth is material here. It runs as follows:
The appellant thereupon filed writ petitions in the High Court. They were heard and dismissed by Coyajee J. An appeal was then filed in the same High Court and heard by the Chief Justice and Bhagwati J. They held that the questions raised were covered by an earlier decision of theirs in another case dated March 11, 1952, and, following that decision, dismissed the appeals without hearing further arguments, as counsel on both sides agreed that the matter was covered by the earlier decision. The appellant then applied for a certificate for leave to appeal here. This was granted by Chagla C. J. and Dixit J. on February 2, 1953.
The learned Judges of the Bombay High Court tried to distinguish the Federal Court's judgment on the ground that no bonus had been declared there and ,so there was no ascertained sum, but, as we have pointed out, the ratio of the decision covers the present case and, in any case, that is our view quite apart from their conclusion.	Precedent
The first question that we have to decide is whether the first respondent had jurisdiction to entertain the petitions made to him as the Authority under the Payment of Wages Act. This depends on whether these bonuses are " wages " within the meaning of the definition in s. 2(vi) of the Act. The scope of the Authority's jurisdiction is set out in s. 15 of the Act. It is to bear and decide (1)all claims arising out of deduction from wages, and (2) all claims regarding delay in the payment of wages. Therefore, unless these bonuses are " wages " within the meaning of the Act, the Authority will have no jurisdiction. The definition of " wages " in s. 2(vi) of the Act is long and complicated but leaving aside the clauses in it that are not material for our present purpose, it runs-
and payment is a recompense for service rendered. Now it is true that bonus in the abstract need not be for services rendered and in that sense need not be a remuneration; for example, there is a shareholder's bonus in certain companies, and there is a life insurance bonus and so forth. But that is not the kind of bonus contemplated here because the kind of remuneration that the definition contemplates is one that is payable " in respect of his employment or of work done in such employment."
Therefore, the kind of bonus that this definition con- templates is one that is remuneration for services rendered or work done. Accordingly, it is a " remuneration " and as the definition includes all remuneration of a specified kind, we are of opinion that bonus of the kind contemplated here falls within the clause that says it must be "
Next comes a clause that limits the kind of remuneration, for, though the opening words are " all remuneration " the words that follow limit it to all remuneration of the kind specified in the next clause, that is, to remuneration " which would be payable if the terms of the contract of employment, express or -implied, were fulfilled. "
Now, it may be possible to say that the words " of the nature aforesaid " only govern the words " additional remuneration " and that they do not apply to "bonus", with the result that the inclusion clause " and includes any bonus etc." would refer to two separate things, namely, (1) bonus and (2)other additional remuneration of the nature aforesaid. In our opinion, the clause means-
(1) "bonus.................. which would be so payable ", and (2)" other additional remuneration of the nature aforesaid which would be so payable."
If that is correct, then the words " which would be so payable " throw us back to the earlier part of the definition and we reach the position that the kind of bonus that is included by the inclusion clause is the kind that would be payable " if the terms of the contract of employment, express or implied, are fulfilled." There is another reason for reaching this conclusion. The opening words of the definition make it clear that " wages "
payment under the definition of "wages", two things are necessary-
On this view, it is not necessary to consider the other points that were argued because, if the definition of wages ", as it stood before the amendment, is not wide enough to include a bonus of the kind we have here, namely, one payable under an award of an Industrial Court, then, the Authority under the Payment of Wages Act had no jurisdiction to entertain the petitions made to it under s. 15 of the Act.

CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeals Nos. 35 & 36 of 1954.
Appeals from the judgments and order dated August 28, 1952, of the Bombay High Court in Appeals Nos. 34 and 35 of 1952, arising out of the orders dated January 24, 1952, of the said High Court exercising its Civil Original Jurisdiction in Misc.

1958. March 19. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BOSE J.-These appeals arise out of petitions made to the Bombay High Court under Art. 226 for writs of certiorari. The appellant is the manager of the Tata Mills Limited, which carries on business in the manufacture and sale of textile goods in Bombay and as such is responsible for the payment of wages under the Payment of Wages Act, 1936. The first respondent was the Authority under the Payment of Wages Act at the times material to these appeals. The sixth respondent is the present Authority. The Authority is entrusted with the duty of deciding cases falling within the purview of the Act.
The second, third, fourth and fifth respondents are employees in the Mills.
A dispute arose about a claim made by the operatives of the Mills for a bonus for the year 1948. This was referred to the Industrial Court at Bombay which made an award on April 23, 1949, and awarded a bonus equivalent to four and a half months' wages subject to certain conditions of which only the sixth is material here. It runs as follows:

Similar claims were made by the second, fourth and fifth respondents for a bonus for the year 1949. The, Industrial Court awarded a bonus equal to two months' wages and in the sixth condition put the date as December 31, 1950. By this time Labour Appellate Tribunals came into existence, so both sides filed appeals against the award to the Labour Appellate Tribunal of Bombay. The appeals failed and the award was upheld.
After that, the matter followed the same pattern. Respondents 2, 4 and 5 applied for their bonus after December 31, 1950. The Mills refused to pay and these respondents applied to the first respondent, the Authority under the Payment of Wages Act.
The two sets of claims, that is to say, the claim of the third respondent for a bonus for the year 1948 and the claims of the second, fourth and fifth respondents for bonuses for the year 1949, were heard together. The appellant contested these applications on two grounds. He questioned the jurisdiction of the Authority to entertain the petitions made to it. He also contended that, in any event, as the condition subject to which the award was made, namely, an application on or before November 30, 1949, was not fulfilled, the claim for a bonus did not lie. The first respondent held that it had jurisdiction and, after hearing the parties on the merits, decreed the various claims.
The appellant thereupon filed writ petitions in the High Court. They were heard and dismissed by Coyajee J. An appeal was then filed in the same High Court and heard by the Chief Justice and Bhagwati J.

The first question that we have to decide is whether the first respondent had jurisdiction to entertain the petitions made to him as the Authority under the Payment of Wages Act. This depends on whether these bonuses are " wages " within the meaning of the definition in s. 2(vi) of the Act. The scope of the Authority's jurisdiction is set out in s. 15 of the Act.

There is another reason for reaching this conclusion. The opening words of the definition make it clear that " wages "

and they said-
The bonus in the present case is not payable because of a contract but because of the award of an Industrial Court. Therefore, according to the Federal Court, it is not " wages " within the meaning of the Payment of Wages Act. In 1957 the definition was amended and the following was added:
The learned Judges of the Bombay High Court tried to distinguish the Federal Court's judgment on the ground that no bonus had been declared there and ,so there was no ascertained sum, but, as we have pointed out, the ratio of the decision covers the present case and, in any case, that is our view quite apart from their conclusion.
