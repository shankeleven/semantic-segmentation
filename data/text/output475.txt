Kalidas Dhanjibhai vs The State Of Bombay on 29 October, 1954	Case Title
CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 80 of 1953.
Appeal by Special Leave granted by the Supreme Court by its order dated the 9th February, 1953, from the Judgment and Order dated the 23rd September, 1952, of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in Criminal Appeal No. 828 of 1952 arising out of the Judgment and Order dated the 27th March, 1952, of the Court of Stipendiary Magistrate, Ahmedabad, in Summary Case No. 3029 of 1954.
Rajni Patel and M. S. K. Sastri for the appellant. M. C. Setalvad, Attorney-General of India, and (Porus A. Mehta and P. G.Gokhale, with him) for the respondent. 1954. October 29. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BOSE, J.-This case is unimportant in itself, for a small fine of Rs. 50 (Rs. 25 on each of two counts) has been imposed for a couple of breaches under section 52 (f) of the Bombay Shops and Establishments Act, 1948, read with rule 18(5) and (6) of the Rules framed under the Act. But the question involved is of general importance in the State of Bombay and affects a large number of similar establishments, so in order to obtain a clarification of the law, this has been selected as a test case.
The appellant is the owner of a small establishbment called the Honesty Engineering Works situate in Ahmedabad in the State of Bombay. He employs three workers. He does business in a very small way by going to certain local mills, collecting orders from them for spare parts, manufacturing the parts so ordered in his workshop, delivering them to the mills when ready and collecting the money therefor. No buying or selling is done on the premises. The question is whether a concern of this nature is a "shop" within the meaning of section 2(27) of the Act. The learned trying Magistrate held that it was not and so acquitted. The High Court, on an appeal against the acquittal, held it was and convicted.	Issue

Now the Central Act, the Factories Act of 1948, was passed on the 23rd of September, 1948. The Bombay Act, though entitled Act LXXIX of 1948, was not passed till the following year, namely, on 11th January, 1949.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BOSE, J.-This case is unimportant in itself, for a small fine of Rs. 50 (Rs. 25 on each of two counts) has been imposed for a couple of breaches under section 52 (f) of the Bombay Shops and Establishments Act, 1948, read with rule 18(5) and (6) of the Rules framed under the Act. But the question involved is of general importance in the State of Bombay and affects a large number of similar establishments, so in order to obtain a clarification of the law, this has been selected as a test case.
The appellant is the owner of a small establishbment called the Honesty Engineering Works situate in Ahmedabad in the State of Bombay. He employs three workers. He does business in a very small way by going to certain local mills, collecting orders from them for spare parts, manufacturing the parts so ordered in his workshop, delivering them to the mills when ready and collecting the money therefor. No buying or selling is done on the premises. The question is whether a concern of this nature is a "shop" within the meaning of section 2(27) of the Act. The learned trying Magistrate held that it was not and so acquitted. The High Court, on an appeal against the acquittal, held it was and convicted.
It is admitted that the appellant maintains no "leave registers" and gives his workers no "leave books" and it is admitted that the Government Inspector of Establishments discovered this on 12th January, 1951, when he inspected the appellant's works. If his establishment is a "shop" within the meaning of section 2(27) he is guilty under the Act; if it is not, he is not guilty.
As we have said, it is admitted that no goods are sold on the premises and it is also admitted that no services are rendered to customers there, for the manufacture of spare parts for sale elsewhere cannot be regarded as "services rendered. "
He says that the word "such" in the phrase "such trade or business" relates back to the opening words of the definition which read-
He argues that the emphasis is on the words "goods are sold"
confines what follows to what has gone before and what has gone before is not the trade of selling in general but only that part of the trade of selling which is carried on defined premises. Counsel argues that there is no justification for ignoring the limitation which the Legislature has placed on the main portion of the definition and holding that "such" relates to a much wider classification of "selling" which the main portion of the definition not only does not envisage but has deliberately excluded. We think that as a matter of plain construction this is logical and right.
The learned Attorney-General went on to contend that even if this is a possible view, his view is also tenable and therefore when we have two possible interpretations we must choose the one which best accords with the policy of the Act. Taking us through the Act he pointed out that this is a piece of social legislation designed partly to prevent sweated labour and the undesirable employment of women and young children and partly to safeguard the health and provide for the safety of workmen and employees. He con- tended that this object would be partly frustrated if small establishments of this kind are placed outside the purview of the Act, for their number is very large and the persons employed in them are entitled to, and require, just as much protection as those more happily placed in larger concerns. We have considered this carefully and are of the opinion that the fear is groundless because there is express provision in the Act for such contingencies. Under section 5 the State Government can by mere notification in the Official Gazette extend the Act to any establishment or class of establishments or any person or class of -persons to which or whom the Act or any of its provisions does not for the time being apply In our opinion, the Legislature did not intend to rope in small establishments of this kind in the first place but reserved power to the State Government to do that when desirable by the very simple process of notification in the Official Gazette. In reaching this conclusion we are influenced by the policy of the Central Legislature on an allied topic. We do not intend to break the general rule that points to the undesirability of interpreting the provisions of one Act -by those of another passed by a different Legislature, but as we have already decided the question of construction and interpretation and are now considering only the general policy of the State Legislature, we deem it right to view the matter in its larger aspect for the special reasons we shall now enumerate.
