The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SUBBA RAO J.-This is an appeal by special leave against the judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay setting aside that of the First Class Magistrate, Broach, and convicting the appellant for contravening the provisions of r. 65 (1) of the Bombay Agricultural Produce Markets Rules, 1941, hereinafter called the Rules, and imposing on him a fine of Rs. 25.
1. Fibres:	Issue
The appellant was a trader carrying on business in cotton at Broach. On February 7 and 9, 1953, he purchased full pressed cotton bales from M/s. Ratanji Faramji & Sons in two instalments of 200 bales each through a licensed broker, Dahyabhai Acharatlal. He also purchased 100 bales from Halday Multi-Purpose Co-operative Society. All these purchases were made by the appellant as a trader in the market area of Broach without the requisite licence from the Market Committee. He was charged in the Court of the Joint Civil Judge (Junior Division) and Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Broach, for committing the breach of r. 65 (1) of the Rules. The Judicial Magistrate held that pressed cotton was not cotton, ginned or unginned, within the meaning of one of the items mentioned in the schedule to the Bombay Agricultural Produce Markets Act (hereinafter called " the Act "), and, therefore, the appellant did not commit any offence under the Act or the Rules framed thereunder. The State of Bombay carried the matter by way of appeal to the High Court of Bombay, and a Division Bench of the said High Court, consisting of Chainani and Shah, JJ., allowed the appeal and convicted the appellant for contravening the provisions of r. 65(1) of the Rules and imposed upon him a fine of Rs. 25. This appeal challenges the correctness of the judgment of the High Court.	Facts
Purshottam Tricumdas, J. B. Dadachanji, S. N. Andley and Rameshwar Nath, for the appellants.
Learned Counsel for the appellant raised before us the following three contentions: (i) the Act and the Rules framed thereunder did not apply to pressed cotton, and, therefore, the appellant did not contravene the provisions of r. 65 (1) of the Rules; (ii) r. 65 is ultra vires inasmuch as its provisions are in excess of the rule making power of the State Government; and (iii) the transactions in question were forward contracts for future delivery, and, as no delivery was intended or in fact made, the appellant cannot be said to have traded in cotton within the market area.	PetArg
The answer to the first contention turns upon the interpretation of cl. (1) of sub-s. (1) of s. 2 of the Act read along with the relevant items or items in the Schedule. The relevant provisions read:
Schedule E.
S. 27 (1): Subject to any rules made by the Provincial Government under section 26 and with the previous sanction of the Director or any other officer specially empowered in this behalf by the Provincial Government, the market committee may in respect of the market area under its management make bye-laws for the regulation of the business and the conditions of trading therein.
The Bombay Agricultural Produce Markets Rules, 1941. Rule 65 (1): No person shall do business as a trader or a general commission agent in agricultural produce in any market area except under a licence granted by the market committee under this rule.
(3). On receipt of such application together with the proper amount of the fee the market committee may, after making such enquiries, as may be considered necessary for the efficient conduct of the market, grant him the licence applied for. On the grant of such licence the applicant shall execute an agreement in such form as the market committee may determine, agreeing to conform with these rules and the bye-laws and such other conditions as may be laid down by the market committee for holding the licence.
(5). The licence shall be granted for a period of one year, after which it may be renewed on a written application, and after such enquiries as are referred to in sub-section (3) as may be considered necessary, and on payment of such fees as may be specified in the bye-laws. (6). The names of all such traders and general, commission agents shall be entered in a register to be maintained for the purpose.
The said provisions may be summarized thus: Section 27 of the Act empowers the Market Committee, subject to any rules made by the State Government under s. 26 and with the previous sanction of the Director, to make bye-laws in respect of a market area for the regulation of the business and conditions of trading therein. Section 26(1) of the Act enables the State Government to make rules for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of the Act, In exercise of that power conferred under s. 26(1), the State Government made r. 65 prohibiting any trader from doing business in agricultural produce except under a licence granted by the Market Committee. In exercise of powers conferred under s. 27 on the Market Committee, it made bye-law 33 prescribing the fee payable in respect of a licence under r. 65 of the Rules.
The question is whether under s. 26(1) the State Government is empowered to make r. 65 prescribing the taking of a licence as a condition for doing business in a market area. It can do so for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of the Act. Section 27, which is a provision of the Act, enables the Market Committee to make bye-laws for the regulation of the business and the conditions of trading in the market area. To enable the Market Committee to discharge its functions under s. 27 of the Act more effectively, the Government made a rule prohibiting a trader from doing business in a market area without licence, and the Market Committee prescribed the fees payable in respect of the licence. The rule was certainly one made for the purpose of facilitating the Market Committee to function effectively under s. 27 of the Act. That the legislature conferred such a power on the State Government is also supported by the provisions of s. 27 of the Act. Under s. 27(1), the bye-laws made by the Market Committee for the regulation of business and conditions of trading in the market area are subject to the rules made by the State Government under s. 26. This indicates that under s. 26 of the Act, the State Government has also power to make rules for the regulation of business and conditions of trading in the market area, and that power can be spelled out from the provisions of s. 26(1) of the Act, Therefore, s. 26(1) confers ample power on the State Government to make r. 65. In this view, it is not necessary to invoke the provisions of s. 26(2)(e) to sustain the power of the State Government to make r. 65.	Section
(2). Any person desiring to hold such licence shall make a written application for a licence to the market committee and shall pay such fee as may be' specified in the bye-laws.
(4). Notwithstanding anything -contained in subrule (3), the market committee may refuse to grant a licence to any person, who, in its opinion, is not solvent or whose operations in the market area are not likely to further efficient working of the market under the control of the market committee.
(7). Whoever does business as a trader or a general commission agent in agricultural produce in any market area without a licence granted under this rule or otherwise contravenes any of the provisions of this rule shall, on conviction, be punishable with fine which may extend to Rs. 200 and in the case of a continued contravention with a further fine which may extend to Rs. 50 for every day during which the contravention continues after the date of the first conviction, subject to the maximum of Rs. 200. Bye-laws of the Agricultural Produce Market Committee, Broach.
Bye-law 33: (1). All traders, general commission agents, brokers, weighmen, measurers, and surveyors operating in the market area shall pay full fees for each market year or any part thereof as per Schedule given in Appendix No. 2 for obtaining licences, required to be taken by them, under Rules 65 and 67.
The third contention though raised was not pursued in View of the word ,business" in r. 65(1) which is comprehensive enough to take in even forward contracts. In the result the appeal fails and is dismissed,	Conclusion
CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION Criminal Appeal No. 200 of 1957.
Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated the September 11, 1956, of the Bombay High Court, in Criminal Appeal No. 742 of 1956, arising out of the judgment and order dated December 31, 1955, of the Joint Civil Judge (J.D.) and Judicial Magistrate, First Class, 'Broach, in Criminal Case No. 605 of 1953.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SUBBA RAO J.-This is an appeal by special leave against the judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay setting aside that of the First Class Magistrate, Broach, and convicting the appellant for contravening the provisions of r. 65 (1) of the Bombay Agricultural Produce Markets Rules, 1941, hereinafter called the Rules, and imposing on him a fine of Rs. 25.

The answer to the first contention turns upon the interpretation of cl. (1) of sub-s. (1) of s. 2 of the Act read along with the relevant items or items in the Schedule. The relevant provisions read:
Schedule E.
1. Fibres:
S. 27 (1): Subject to any rules made by the Provincial Government under section 26 and with the previous sanction of the Director or any other officer specially empowered in this behalf by the Provincial Government, the market committee may in respect of the market area under its management make bye-laws for the regulation of the business and the conditions of trading therein.
The Bombay Agricultural Produce Markets Rules, 1941. Rule 65 (1): No person shall do business as a trader or a general commission agent in agricultural produce in any market area except under a licence granted by the market committee under this rule.
(2). Any person desiring to hold such licence shall make a written application for a licence to the market committee and shall pay such fee as may be' specified in the bye-laws.
(3). On receipt of such application together with the proper amount of the fee the market committee may, after making such enquiries, as may be considered necessary for the efficient conduct of the market, grant him the licence applied for. On the grant of such licence the applicant shall execute an agreement in such form as the market committee may determine, agreeing to conform with these rules and the bye-laws and such other conditions as may be laid down by the market committee for holding the licence.

(5). The licence shall be granted for a period of one year, after which it may be renewed on a written application, and after such enquiries as are referred to in sub-section (3) as may be considered necessary, and on payment of such fees as may be specified in the bye-laws. (6). The names of all such traders and general, commission agents shall be entered in a register to be maintained for the purpose.
(7). Whoever does business as a trader or a general commission agent in agricultural produce in any market area without a licence granted under this rule or otherwise contravenes any of the provisions of this rule shall, on conviction, be punishable with fine which may extend to Rs. 200 and in the case of a continued contravention with a further fine which may extend to Rs. 50 for every day during which the contravention continues after the date of the first conviction, subject to the maximum of Rs. 200. Bye-laws of the Agricultural Produce Market Committee, Broach.
Bye-law 33: (1). All traders, general commission agents, brokers, weighmen, measurers, and surveyors operating in the market area shall pay full fees for each market year or any part thereof as per Schedule given in Appendix No. 2 for obtaining licences, required to be taken by them, under Rules 65 and 67.
The said provisions may be summarized thus: Section 27 of the Act empowers the Market Committee, subject to any rules made by the State Government under s. 26 and with the previous sanction of the Director, to make bye-laws in respect of a market area for the regulation of the business and conditions of trading therein. Section 26(1) of the Act enables the State Government to make rules for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of the Act, In exercise of that power conferred under s. 26(1), the State Government made r. 65 prohibiting any trader from doing business in agricultural produce except under a licence granted by the Market Committee. In exercise of powers conferred under s. 27 on the Market Committee, it made bye-law 33 prescribing the fee payable in respect of a licence under r. 65 of the Rules.
The question is whether under s. 26(1) the State Government is empowered to make r. 65 prescribing the taking of a licence as a condition for doing business in a market area. It can do so for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of the Act. Section 27, which is a provision of the Act, enables the Market Committee to make bye-laws for the regulation of the business and the conditions of trading in the market area. To enable the Market Committee to discharge its functions under s. 27 of the Act more effectively, the Government made a rule prohibiting a trader from doing business in a market area without licence, and the Market Committee prescribed the fees payable in respect of the licence. The rule was certainly one made for the purpose of facilitating the Market Committee to function effectively under s. 27 of the Act. That the legislature conferred such a power on the State Government is also supported by the provisions of s. 27 of the Act. Under s. 27(1), the bye-laws made by the Market Committee for the regulation of business and conditions of trading in the market area are subject to the rules made by the State Government under s. 26. This indicates that under s. 26 of the Act, the State Government has also power to make rules for the regulation of business and conditions of trading in the market area, and that power can be spelled out from the provisions of s. 26(1) of the Act, Therefore, s. 26(1) confers ample power on the State Government to make r. 65. In this view, it is not necessary to invoke the provisions of s. 26(2)(e) to sustain the power of the State Government to make r. 65.
The third contention though raised was not pursued in View of the word ,business" in r. 65(1) which is comprehensive enough to take in even forward contracts. In the result the appeal fails and is dismissed,	Total Judgement
