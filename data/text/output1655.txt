CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 10 of 1960. Appeal from the judgment and decree dated February 24, 1959, of the Bombay High Court in First Appeal No. 540 of 1958. M....C. Setalvad, Attorney-General for India, A. P. Bhatt, Rameshwar Nath, S. N. Andley, P. L. Vohra and J. B. Dadachanji, for the appellants.
The learned Judge of the City Civil Court accepted all the contentions of the respondent Bhaskar and made the declarations claimed.	Issue
1960. December 16. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SARKAR, J.-Dadoba Tukaram Thakoor carried on a business under the name and style of Oriental Metal Pressing Works. On May 26,1955, a private company was incorporated under the name of Oriental Metal Pressing Works Ltd., hereafter called the Company, to take over the aforesaid business. On July 7, 1955, Dadoba transferred his business to the Company. On the same date, an agreement was made between him and the Company by which he was appointed the managing director of the Company for life and was given the power "by deed inter vivos or by will or codicil to appoint any person to be a managing director in his place and stead". Regulation 109 of the articles of the Company reproduced these provisions. The shareholders of the Company were Dadoba, his brother, the respondent Bhaskar, and his two sons, the appellant Govind and the respondent Harish, of whom the first three were the directors, Dadoba being the managing director. This constitution of the Company continued till Dadoba's death on January 14, 1957.
Dadoba had died leaving a will whereby he purported to appoint the appellant Govind the managing director of the Company in his place from the date of his death. Shortly after Dadoba's death, disputes arose between the appellant Govind and the respondent Bhaskar. The appellant Govind was contending that the respondent Bhaskar had ceased to be a director on account of his failure to attend the directors' meetings. He also purported to co-opt the appellant Bhal- chandra as a director. The respondent Bhaskar contended that be had not ceased to be a director and challenged the legality of the appointment of the appellant Bhalchandra as a director. He further contended that the appointment of the appellant Govind as the managing director of the Company by the will of Dadoba, was void. On November 22, 1957, the respondent Bhaskar filed a suit in the City Civil Court of Bombay against the Company, the appellants Govind and Bhalchandra and the respondent Harish for the following declarations and for reliefs incidental thereto:
The Company and the appellants Govind and Bhalchandra appealed from this decision to the High Court at Bombay. The appeal came up for hearing before a bench of two learned Judges of that Court. These learned Judges having taken different views, the matter was referred to another learned Judge of the same High Court. In the eventual result according to the opinion of the majority of the learned Judges, the appeal was dismissed and the decree of the City Civil Court was confirmed. The High Court however granted a certificate under Art. 133(1)(c) of the Constitution and the present appeal has been filed by the Company, Govind and Balchandra pursuant thereto. The respondents to this appeal are Bhaskar and Harish.
It appears that while the appeal was pending in this Court, the respondent Bhaskar sold his holding in the Company to the appellant Govind and has now no interest in the Company or the appeal. No one has consequently appeared to contest the appeal in this Court, the respondent Harish apparently not being interested in doing so. In these circumstances, the questions whether the respondent Bhaskar continues to be a director and whether the appellant Bhalchandra was legally co-opted as a director are no longer live issues and have not been canvassed in this appeal. On those questions therefore we express no opinion. Another result, rather unfortunate, has been that we have not had the advantage of arguments against the appeal.	Facts
It may be that the proviso was enacted ex abundanti cautela or it may be again, to prevent a possible argument that by the appointment of alternate directors an evasion of the main part of s. 86B was being attempted. In view of the fact that the power to appoint alternate directors was not given by the old Act, but had to be given by the articles, such an argument might not have been unlikely. Therefore, it seems to us that the proviso to s. 86B of the old Act does not assist the argument that in s. 312 of the new Act, the word "assignment" would include "appointment". We think we ought to say something about what strikes us to be the policy behind s. 312 of the new Act. We have earlier said that under s. 255 of that Act a certain Dumber of directors in a public company has to be appointed by the company in a general meeting. In the case of a private company likewise, the directors have to be appointed similarly except to the extent the articles otherwise provide. It would therefore appear to be the policy of the Act that to a certain extent the appointments of the directors have to be made by the shareholders. It is intended that a certain number of directors would be the chosen representatives of the shareholders. If a director appointed (1) [1897] A.C. 647, 652.	PetArg
The respondent did not appear.
Another argument that has to be dealt with is that if s. 312 does not prohibit an appointment by a director of his successor, that section can easily be rendered infructuous by a director adopting the simple device of appointing a person as his successor in office instead of transferring the office to him. It seems to us that the question does not really arise. A director can legally and effectively appoint his successor only to the extent the articles permit this subject, of course, to the limit prescribed in s. 255 in the case of a public company. An appointment so legally made does not result in an evasion of s. 312 for, as we have earlier said, the section could not have intended to prevent what another section in the same Act made legal. An appointment made outside the powers legally conferred by the articles is wholly ineffective' and therefore is not an appointment at all and hence again, does not result in an evasion of s. 312.
The learned Attorney-General pointed out that in the new Act there is no proviso, and therefore the rule of construction applied by the High Court, which enables by raising a presumption, something to be included in the main part of a section by reason of a provision in a proviso to it, has no application to the new Act for, here the provision in the proviso has been enacted in the form of an independent section, namely, s. 313. According to him, this departure from the old arrangement of the provisions, in the new Act shows that it was not intended to continue the policy of the old Act. He also said that the proviso in substance stated that the appointment by a director of an alternate director might in certain circumstances be deemed to be an assignment. He pointed out that by using the word "deemed" the proviso made it clear that the appointment of an' alternate director was not a real assignment of office but was only to be fictionally taken as one. His contention was that such fiction could arise in a case coming strictly within the proviso but could not by extension be made to arise in any other case. These seem to us to be arguments of weight. Further in s. 313 of the new Act, which has taken the place of the first proviso to s. 86B of the old Act, the power to appoint an alternate director hag been given to the board and not to the director who intends to absent himself No scope for any deeming provision as in the Act of 1913 remains. Therefore again an argument based on the proviso to s. 86B would not be available for the purpose of the present Act.	RespArg
The High Court was of the view that unless "assignment" included "appointment", the object of ,the Act would be defeated. It was said that the intention and the object of the section was to restrain and prevent a director from putting some one in his place and stead by any act on his part. This point was further expressed more clearly in the following words: "It is now well understood that the new Companies Act, aims at eradicating many serious mischief which the principle of perpetual management of companies had caused in the past". The High Court felt that it would be defeating that aim by reading s. 312 as if the words "assignment of his office"
In view of the clear provisions of s. 255 we do not think that it can be said, as was done in the High Court, that ss. 254 and 317 of the Act, impliedly indicate that there should be no perpetual management. Section 254 says that a corporation or an association of persons shall not be eligible as a director. But this is not because, otherwise, there would be perpetual management. The persons comprising the corporation or the association must change from time to time and so, even if they were appointed directors, there would be no perpetual management. We rather think that the idea behind s. 254 is that as the office of a director is to some extent an office of trust, there should be somebody readily available who can be held responsible for the failure to carry out the trust and it might be difficult to fix that responsibility if the director was a corporation or an association of persons. Turning to s. 317, we find that it provides that a managing director cannot be appointed for a term exceeding five years at a time. Section 315 however makes s. 317 inapplicable to a private company. Therefore, s. 317 is not available to support an argument that the Act does not want a private company-and we are concerned with that type of a company-to be under perpetual management. But indeed s. 317 does not support that argument in the case of a public company either. It forbids an appointment of a managing director for more than five years "at a time". It permits the managing director to be reappointed after a term is over. If he is so reappointed, then there would be "perpetual management" by him. The Act does not, therefore, intend by s. 317, to prevent that. Lastly, s. 317 is not concerned with the directors, which s. 312 is.
We have now to consider an argument based on the first proviso to s. 86B of the Companies Act of 1913. The main part of s. 86B contained a provision analogous to that of s. 312 of the new Act. It made an assignment of his office by a director to another person, under an agreement with the company, void, unless such assignment was approved by a special resolution of the company. Under the new Act the assignment has been made altogether void and would not become valid even if approved by a special resolution of the company. Now, the proviso laid down that the exercise by a director of a power to appoint an alternate director to act for him during an absence of not less than three months from the district in which meetings of the directors are ordinarily held, if done with the approval of the board of directors, would not be deemed to be an assignment of office within the meaning of this section. The High Court took the view that this proviso showed that in certain circumstances an appointment by a director of another in his place might be deemed to bean assignment of his office and that since the new Act is a consolidating Act, it must be deemed to have continued the policy of the earlier Act and, therefore, for the purpose of s. 312, an "assignment" must include an "appointment".
It further seems to us that the proviso to s. 86B does not indicate that it was intended that the word "assignment" in the main part of the section would include "appointment". The rule of construction on which the High Court relied in arriving at the view that it did, was put in these words:	Precedent
The Courts below held that the appointment of the appellant Govind as managing director by the will of Dadoba was void in view of the provisions of s. 312 of the Companies Act, 1956. That section reads thus:
by the company was permitted to assign his office, then the new incumbent would not be the chosen representative of the shareholders, and the intention of the Act would be defeated. It seems to us that it is to prevent this result that the Act forbids a director by s. 312 from assigning his office. Where however a director has been appointed otherwise than by the company in a general meeting, the shareholders have nothing to do with his appointment. Such a director is not the chosen representative of the shareholders and the shareholders cannot claim to have a say in the appointment of his successor. We can discern no policy in the Act which can. be said to be liable to be defeated by the appointment of the successor of such a director by him. Therefore s. 312 was not concerned with such an appointment.	Section
In the present case Dadoba had power under the articles to appoint a person to be the managing. director in succession to him, and in exercise of that power he bad appointed the appellant Govind as the managing director to hold the office after his death. Such power was clearly recognised by, and legal under, s. 255 of the new Act. For the reasons earlier stated, the exercise of such power does not offend s. 312. It follows that the appellant Govind had been lawfully and validly appointed the managing director of the Company. We, therefore, declare that the appellant Govind had been validly appointed the managing director of the Company, and set aside the decisions of the Courts below that he had not been so appointed. We have not been asked to interfere with the rest of the judgment under appeal and we do not do so. We also make no order for costs as no costs have been asked.
Appeal allowed.

1960. December 16. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SARKAR, J.-Dadoba Tukaram Thakoor carried on a business under the name and style of Oriental Metal Pressing Works. On May 26,1955, a private company was incorporated under the name of Oriental Metal Pressing Works Ltd., hereafter called the Company, to take over the aforesaid business. On July 7, 1955, Dadoba transferred his business to the Company. On the same date, an agreement was made between him and the Company by which he was appointed the managing director of the Company for life and was given the power "by deed inter vivos or by will or codicil to appoint any person to be a managing director in his place and stead". Regulation 109 of the articles of the Company reproduced these provisions. The shareholders of the Company were Dadoba, his brother, the respondent Bhaskar, and his two sons, the appellant Govind and the respondent Harish, of whom the first three were the directors, Dadoba being the managing director. This constitution of the Company continued till Dadoba's death on January 14, 1957.
Dadoba had died leaving a will whereby he purported to appoint the appellant Govind the managing director of the Company in his place from the date of his death. Shortly after Dadoba's death, disputes arose between the appellant Govind and the respondent Bhaskar. The appellant Govind was contending that the respondent Bhaskar had ceased to be a director on account of his failure to attend the directors' meetings. He also purported to co-opt the appellant Bhal- chandra as a director. The respondent Bhaskar contended that be had not ceased to be a director and challenged the legality of the appointment of the appellant Bhalchandra as a director. He further contended that the appointment of the appellant Govind as the managing director of the Company by the will of Dadoba, was void. On November 22, 1957, the respondent Bhaskar filed a suit in the City Civil Court of Bombay against the Company, the appellants Govind and Bhalchandra and the respondent Harish for the following declarations and for reliefs incidental thereto:
The learned Judge of the City Civil Court accepted all the contentions of the respondent Bhaskar and made the declarations claimed.
The Company and the appellants Govind and Bhalchandra appealed from this decision to the High Court at Bombay. The appeal came up for hearing before a bench of two learned Judges of that Court. These learned Judges having taken different views, the matter was referred to another learned Judge of the same High Court. In the eventual result according to the opinion of the majority of the learned Judges, the appeal was dismissed and the decree of the City Civil Court was confirmed. The High Court however granted a certificate under Art. 133(1)(c) of the Constitution and the present appeal has been filed by the Company, Govind and Balchandra pursuant thereto. The respondents to this appeal are Bhaskar and Harish.
It appears that while the appeal was pending in this Court, the respondent Bhaskar sold his holding in the Company to the appellant Govind and has now no interest in the Company or the appeal. No one has consequently appeared to contest the appeal in this Court, the respondent Harish apparently not being interested in doing so. In these circumstances, the questions whether the respondent Bhaskar continues to be a director and whether the appellant Bhalchandra was legally co-opted as a director are no longer live issues and have not been canvassed in this appeal. On those questions therefore we express no opinion. Another result, rather unfortunate, has been that we have not had the advantage of arguments against the appeal.
The Courts below held that the appointment of the appellant Govind as managing director by the will of Dadoba was void in view of the provisions of s. 312 of the Companies Act, 1956. That section reads thus:
The High Court was of the view that unless "assignment" included "appointment", the object of ,the Act would be defeated. It was said that the intention and the object of the section was to restrain and prevent a director from putting some one in his place and stead by any act on his part. This point was further expressed more clearly in the following words: "It is now well understood that the new Companies Act, aims at eradicating many serious mischief which the principle of perpetual management of companies had caused in the past". The High Court felt that it would be defeating that aim by reading s. 312 as if the words "assignment of his office"
But the whole of the Company's undertaking was really a largess from him. In fact he held nearly 43% of the shares of the Company. It is inconceivable that perpetual manage- ment by him would have worked to the detriment of the Company. We are therefore unable to agree that it was the object of the Act or of s. 312 to prevent a director from appointing his successor.
In view of the clear provisions of s. 255 we do not think that it can be said, as was done in the High Court, that ss. 254 and 317 of the Act, impliedly indicate that there should be no perpetual management. Section 254 says that a corporation or an association of persons shall not be eligible as a director. But this is not because, otherwise, there would be perpetual management. The persons comprising the corporation or the association must change from time to time and so, even if they were appointed directors, there would be no perpetual management. We rather think that the idea behind s. 254 is that as the office of a director is to some extent an office of trust, there should be somebody readily available who can be held responsible for the failure to carry out the trust and it might be difficult to fix that responsibility if the director was a corporation or an association of persons. Turning to s. 317, we find that it provides that a managing director cannot be appointed for a term exceeding five years at a time. Section 315 however makes s. 317 inapplicable to a private company. Therefore, s. 317 is not available to support an argument that the Act does not want a private company-and we are concerned with that type of a company-to be under perpetual management. But indeed s. 317 does not support that argument in the case of a public company either. It forbids an appointment of a managing director for more than five years "at a time". It permits the managing director to be reappointed after a term is over. If he is so reappointed, then there would be "perpetual management" by him. The Act does not, therefore, intend by s. 317, to prevent that. Lastly, s. 317 is not concerned with the directors, which s. 312 is.
Another argument that has to be dealt with is that if s. 312 does not prohibit an appointment by a director of his successor, that section can easily be rendered infructuous by a director adopting the simple device of appointing a person as his successor in office instead of transferring the office to him. It seems to us that the question does not really arise. A director can legally and effectively appoint his successor only to the extent the articles permit this subject, of course, to the limit prescribed in s. 255 in the case of a public company. An appointment so legally made does not result in an evasion of s. 312 for, as we have earlier said, the section could not have intended to prevent what another section in the same Act made legal. An appointment made outside the powers legally conferred by the articles is wholly ineffective' and therefore is not an appointment at all and hence again, does not result in an evasion of s. 312.
We have now to consider an argument based on the first proviso to s. 86B of the Companies Act of 1913. The main part of s. 86B contained a provision analogous to that of s. 312 of the new Act. It made an assignment of his office by a director to another person, under an agreement with the company, void, unless such assignment was approved by a special resolution of the company. Under the new Act the assignment has been made altogether void and would not become valid even if approved by a special resolution of the company. Now, the proviso laid down that the exercise by a director of a power to appoint an alternate director to act for him during an absence of not less than three months from the district in which meetings of the directors are ordinarily held, if done with the approval of the board of directors, would not be deemed to be an assignment of office within the meaning of this section. The High Court took the view that this proviso showed that in certain circumstances an appointment by a director of another in his place might be deemed to bean assignment of his office and that since the new Act is a consolidating Act, it must be deemed to have continued the policy of the earlier Act and, therefore, for the purpose of s. 312, an "assignment" must include an "appointment".
The learned Attorney-General pointed out that in the new Act there is no proviso, and therefore the rule of construction applied by the High Court, which enables by raising a presumption, something to be included in the main part of a section by reason of a provision in a proviso to it, has no application to the new Act for, here the provision in the proviso has been enacted in the form of an independent section, namely, s. 313. According to him, this departure from the old arrangement of the provisions, in the new Act shows that it was not intended to continue the policy of the old Act. He also said that the proviso in substance stated that the appointment by a director of an alternate director might in certain circumstances be deemed to be an assignment. He pointed out that by using the word "deemed" the proviso made it clear that the appointment of an' alternate director was not a real assignment of office but was only to be fictionally taken as one. His contention was that such fiction could arise in a case coming strictly within the proviso but could not by extension be made to arise in any other case. These seem to us to be arguments of weight. Further in s. 313 of the new Act, which has taken the place of the first proviso to s. 86B of the old Act, the power to appoint an alternate director hag been given to the board and not to the director who intends to absent himself No scope for any deeming provision as in the Act of 1913 remains. Therefore again an argument based on the proviso to s. 86B would not be available for the purpose of the present Act.
It further seems to us that the proviso to s. 86B does not indicate that it was intended that the word "assignment" in the main part of the section would include "appointment". The rule of construction on which the High Court relied in arriving at the view that it did, was put in these words:
It may be that the proviso was enacted ex abundanti cautela or it may be again, to prevent a possible argument that by the appointment of alternate directors an evasion of the main part of s. 86B was being attempted. In view of the fact that the power to appoint alternate directors was not given by the old Act, but had to be given by the articles, such an argument might not have been unlikely. Therefore, it seems to us that the proviso to s. 86B of the old Act does not assist the argument that in s. 312 of the new Act, the word "assignment" would include "appointment". We think we ought to say something about what strikes us to be the policy behind s. 312 of the new Act. We have earlier said that under s. 255 of that Act a certain Dumber of directors in a public company has to be appointed by the company in a general meeting. In the case of a private company likewise, the directors have to be appointed similarly except to the extent the articles otherwise provide. It would therefore appear to be the policy of the Act that to a certain extent the appointments of the directors have to be made by the shareholders. It is intended that a certain number of directors would be the chosen representatives of the shareholders. If a director appointed (1) [1897] A.C. 647, 652.
by the company was permitted to assign his office, then the new incumbent would not be the chosen representative of the shareholders, and the intention of the Act would be defeated. It seems to us that it is to prevent this result that the Act forbids a director by s. 312 from assigning his office. Where however a director has been appointed otherwise than by the company in a general meeting, the shareholders have nothing to do with his appointment. Such a director is not the chosen representative of the shareholders and the shareholders cannot claim to have a say in the appointment of his successor. We can discern no policy in the Act which can. be said to be liable to be defeated by the appointment of the successor of such a director by him. Therefore s. 312 was not concerned with such an appointment.
In the present case Dadoba had power under the articles to appoint a person to be the managing. director in succession to him, and in exercise of that power he bad appointed the appellant Govind as the managing director to hold the office after his death. Such power was clearly recognised by, and legal under, s. 255 of the new Act. For the reasons earlier stated, the exercise of such power does not offend s. 312. It follows that the appellant Govind had been lawfully and validly appointed the managing director of the Company. We, therefore, declare that the appellant Govind had been validly appointed the managing director of the Company, and set aside the decisions of the Courts below that he had not been so appointed. We have not been asked to interfere with the rest of the judgment under appeal and we do not do so. We also make no order for costs as no costs have been asked.
Appeal allowed.
