The Oriental Investment Co., Ltd vs The Commissioner Of Income-Tax,Bombay on 22 May, 1957	Case Title
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 153 of 1954.
Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated January 15, 1952, of the Bombay High Court in Income-Tax Application No. 54 of 1951.
1957. May 22. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR J.-This is an appeal by the assessee by special leave and the question for decision is whether questions of law, if any, arise out of the order of the Appellate Tribunal. The facts giving rise to the appeal are that the petitioner company was incorporated on July 29,1924, as an investment company, the objects of which are set out in el. III of the memorandum of association and more particularly in sub-cls. 1, 2, 15 and 16 of that clause. The assessment years under review. are 1943-44 to 1948-49, excepting the year 1947-48. According to its petition made in the High Court of Bombay, the petitioner company dealt with its assets as follows:
Section 66 (1) of the Income-tax Act (hereinafter termed the Act) provides that any assessee may require the Appellate Tribunal to refer to the High Court any question of law arising out of its appellate order and it is the statutory duty of the Appellate Tribunal to draft the statement of the case and refer the question of law arising out of such order to the High Court but the primary requirement is that there must be a question of law arising out of the order. Should the Tribunal refuse to state the case as required under s. 66(1) of the Act on the ground that no question of law arises, the assessee has the right to apply to the High Court requiring the Appellate Tribunal to state a case and refer it to the High Court but again the essential consideration is the existence of a question of law. arising out of the order.
To draw a line between what is a question of law and what is a question of fact is not always easy. It is difficult to define this distinction which has given rise to a number of decisions, which it will be useful to discuss at this stage. In Stanley v. Gramophone and Typewriter, Limited(1) the Master of the Rolls discussed this question as follows :
which belongs only to a finding on questions of pure fact. This is sought to be affected by styling the finding on a mixed question of law and fact a finding of fact." According to the dictum of Lord Wrenbury the question for the Court was whether on the facts found and stated by the Commissioners the clerk held the office within the meaning of the Act which was a question of law.	Issue
This gives the history of the acquisition and disposal of shares and also how the various transactions were entered into and why. Prior to 1940 the assessee company made a claim every year for being treated as a dealer in investments and properties but this contention was consistently repelled and upto the assessment year 1939- 40 the assessee company was assessed on the basis of being an investor but it appears that for the assessment year 1940-41 and the two following years 1941-42 and 1942-43 the Department accepting the plea of the assessee company treated it as a dealer in shares, securities and immovable properties and assessed it on that basis. For these years and for the assessment year 1943-44 the company made its Return on that basis. But after the Return had been filed for the year 1943-44 the assessee company withdrew its Return and filed a revised Return on March 7, 1944, contending that it was not a dealer but merely an investor. Along with the Return it filed a letter dated March 6, 1944, in which inter alia it stated:
It was also contended that it never carried on any business in the purchase or sale of shares, securities or properties and therefore prayed that in view of the order of the Central Board of Revenue made on its application under s. 26(1) of the Excess Profits Tax Act it should be assessed for income-tax purpose as an investor and not as a dealer. The Income-tax Officer rejected this plea and " held the investments as the stock-in-trade of its business therein which it carried on during the 'previous year' also ". The company took an appeal to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner which was dismissed and the order of the Income-tax Officer upheld. It then appealed to the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal, Bombay, where the same contentions were raised but were, repelled. The Tribunal said:	Facts
R. J. Kolah, J. B. Dadachanji, S. N. Andley and Rameshwar Nath, for the appellant.
The Tribunal after holding that the company was under no misapprehension when it claimed to be a dealer in investments in the earlier years because it was then always incurring losses and that the present contention was raised because it made "substantial profits" said:
This was more than it had said in its appellate order. The assessee company then made an application under s. 66(2) of the Indian Income-tax Act for requiring the Appellate Tribunal to state the case and refer it to the High Court but this application was dismissed, and then the company obtained special leave to appeal to this Court. Counsel for the assessee company contends that the questions of law arise out of the order of the Tribunal because the Tribunal has ignored the documentary evidence produced before it, has based it decision on irrelevant matters, has failed to consider crucial facts and has misdirected itself by assuming that the petitioner was a dealer from the very beginning which was contrary to the documents produced before it.	PetArg
C. K. Daphtary, Solicitor-General of India, G. N. Joshi and R. H. Dhebar, for the respondent.	RespArg
Thus the grounds on which the case was decided against the assessee were (1) that the assessee claimed to be a dealer or an investor according as it incurred losses or made profits and (2) that because of the objects contained in the memorandum of association and because of its assertion made in the past as being a dealer the assessee could not be held to be an investor.
The company then applied to the Appellate Tribunal under s. 66(1) of the Indian Income-tax Act for a reference of the following questions for the opinion of the High Court:
This prayer was rejected because in the opinion -of the Tribunal no question of law arose out of its order. It said :
These observations were explained by Hamilton J. in The American Thread Co. v. Joyce (2) as implying that by giving the material on which their finding was based the Commissioners were inviting the court to determine whether on that material they could reason. ably arrive at the conclusion on which they did arrive. The House of Lords on appeal categorically confirmed that the Courts had no jurisdiction over conclusions of fact except to see whether there was evidence to justify them and that proper legal principles had been applied.
Lord Clerk in Californian Copper Syndicate v. Harris (3) has laid down the test in the following words:
operation of business in carrying out a scheme for profit- making."
The Lord President in a Scottish case Cayzer, Irvine & Co., Ltd. v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue (1) stated the grounds on which the court can interfere with the finding of the Commissioner as follows:
Lord Parker in Farmer v. Trustees of the Late William Cotton (2) after referring to the difficulty of distinguishing between a question of fact and a question of law observed:
But this statement of the law was considerably modified in Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Lysaght (3) where it was held that if the issue before the court could be described as a "question of degree" the conclusion must be a question of fact.

The Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. The Korean Syndicate, Ltd. (1) was a case where a syndicate was registered for the purpose of acquiring and working concessions and turning them to account, and of investing and dealing with monies not immediately required. The syndicate acquired part of a right to a concession in Korea and then under an agreement described as a "lease", in consideration of receiving sums of money termed "royalties" but which were really percentages of profits made by assignee company, assigned the lease to a development company. Some moneys which were received from sale of certain shares obtained by the syndicate in exchange for shares originally acquired in the mining company were deposited in a bank. The activities of the company were during the relevant period confined to receiving the bank interest and royalties, distributing the amount amongst its shareholders as dividend. The question for decision was whether the syndicate was carrying on a business and was therefore liable to excess profits duty. From these facts it was concluded that they were carrying on a business.
In Great Western Railway Company v. Bater (2) the question for decision was whether a clerk held a -public office to fall within Sch. E. It was held that the determination by the Commissioners of questions of pure fact are not to be disturbed unless it should appear that there was no evidence before them upon which they, as reasonable men, could arrive at the conclusion which they came to. Lord Atkinson said:
In Lysaght v. The Commissioners of Inland Revenue (1) the question for decision was whether the assessee was a resident and ordinarily resident in United Kingdom in the year of assessment. Lord Buckmaster said:.
Jones v. Leeming(2) was a case where the respondent with three other -persons obtained an option to purchase a rubber estate in the Malay Peninsula. That estate along with another was sold at a profit. The Commissioners found that the respondent had acquired the property with the sole object of turning it over again at a profit and at no time had he the intention of holding it. This transaction was held not to be in the nature of trade nor the profits arising therefrom in the nature of income but they were accretions to (1) (1928) 13 T.C. 511, 533, 534.

capital and therefore not subject to tax under Case VI of Sch. D. In Cameron v. Prendergast (1) the following test was laid down by Viscount Maugham:
In Bomford v. Osborne (2) a farm was working as a mixed farm but as a single unit. The question for decision was whether the assessment could be apportioned one part being assessed as a farm and the other as a nursery. Viscount Simon laid down the test in the following words:

In Edward v. Bairstow (1) the respondent embarked upon a joint venture to purchase a spinning plant with the object of holding it for quick resale and at a profit. The General Commissioners found that there was no venture in the nature of trade but the court held that the facts found led inevitably to the conclusion that the transaction was a venture in the nature of trade and that the Commissioners' inference to the contrary was erroneous. Lord Simonds observed at p. 54 that:
and for that matter what constitutes "profits or gains"
The dicta of Warrington L.J. in Cooper v. Stubbs (2) that intervention by a court is proper only:

Bose J. in Seth Suwallal Chhogalal v. Commissioner of Income-tax(2) stated the test as follows:
shares and it was held that this was a question of fact but if the Appellate Tribunal decided the question by taking into consideration materials which are irrelevant to the enquiry or partly relevant and partly irrelevant or based its decision partly on conjectures then in such a situation an issue of law arises, which would be subject to review by the court and the finding given by the Tribunal would be vitiated.
The limits of the boundary dividing questions of fact and questions of law were laid down by this court in Meenakshi Mills, Madurai v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras (1) where the question for decision was whether certain profits made and shown in the name of certain intermediaries were in fact profits actually earned by the assessee or the intermediaries. Taking the course of dealings and the extent of the transaction and the position of the intermediaries and all the evidence into consideration the Tribunal came to the conclusion that the intermediaries were dummies brought into existence by the appellant for concealing the true amount of profits and that the sales in their name were sham and fictitious and profits were actually earned by the assessee. The test laid down by this Court is to be found in the various passages in that judgment. At p. 701 Venkatarama Ayyar J. pointed out that questions of fact are not open to review by the court unless they are unsupported by any evidence or are perverse. At p. 706 it was observed :
Counsel for the assessee relies on the decision of Kishan Prasad & Co., Ltd. v. Commissioner of Incometax, Punjab (1) where this Court held that the circumstance whether a transaction is or is not within the powers of the company has no bearing on the nature of the transaction or on the question whether the profits arising therefrom are capital or revenue income and, therefore, it is contended that the Tribunal has (1) [1955] 27 I.T.R. 49.

The sales are contained in para 3 (b) which may be quoted:	Section

The result of the authorities is that inference from facts would be a question of fact or of law according as the point for determination is one of pure fact or a mixed question of law and fact and that a finding of fact without evidence to support it or if based on relevant and irrelevant matters is not unassailable.
rights of the parties on an application of the appropriate principles of law to the facts ascertained. The law was thus summed up at p. 720:
The questions of law that arise out of the order of the Tribunal are:
We would therefore allow this appeal, set aside the order of the High Court and remit the case to the High Court for directing the Tribunal to state a case on the aforesaid two questions. The appellant will have its costs in this Court and in the High Court for the proceedings so far taken. Further costs will be in the discretion of the High Court. Appeal allowed. Case remitted.

Lord Clerk in Californian Copper Syndicate v. Harris (3) has laid down the test in the following words:
operation of business in carrying out a scheme for profit- making."
In that case the objects set out in the memorandum of association pointed distinctly to a highly speculative business and the mode of actual procedure of the company was also directed in the same direction. Taking into consideration the course of dealing of the shares by the company and also that the turning of investment to account was not merely incidental but was an essential feature of the business, speculation being among the appointed means of the company's business the court came to the conclusion that the company was carrying on a business.
The Lord President in a Scottish case Cayzer, Irvine & Co., Ltd. v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue (1) stated the grounds on which the court can interfere with the finding of the Commissioner as follows:

The question for decision was whether the syndicate was carrying on a business and was therefore liable to excess profits duty. From these facts it was concluded that they were carrying on a business.
Atkinson L.J. pointed out at p. 204 that merely because a company is incorporated it does not necessarily follow that it is carrying on business.- Its memorandum only shows that the company was incorporated for a particular purpose but taking into consideration the surrounding circumstances and facts of the case it was concluded that the company was carrying on a business.
In Great Western Railway Company v. Bater (2) the question for decision was whether a clerk held a -public office to fall within Sch. E. It was held that the determination by the Commissioners of questions of pure fact are not to be disturbed unless it should appear that there was no evidence before them upon which they, as reasonable men, could arrive at the conclusion which they came to.

Bose J. in Seth Suwallal Chhogalal v. Commissioner of Income-tax(2) stated the test as follows:
Sufficiency of evidence was explained to mean whether the Income-tax authority considered its existence so probable that a prudent man ought under the circumstances of the case to act upon the supposition that it exists. The question for decision in Dhirajlal Girdharilal v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay(3) was whether a Hindu undivided family was carrying on business in (1) [1937] 5 I.T.R. I70, 179. (3) [1954] 26 I.T.R. 736. (2) [1949] 17 I.T.R. 269, 277.
shares and it was held that this was a question of fact but if the Appellate Tribunal decided the question by taking into consideration materials which are irrelevant to the enquiry or partly relevant and partly irrelevant or based its decision partly on conjectures then in such a situation an issue of law arises, which would be subject to review by the court and the finding given by the Tribunal would be vitiated.
The result of the authorities is that inference from facts would be a question of fact or of law according as the point for determination is one of pure fact or a mixed question of law and fact and that a finding of fact without evidence to support it or if based on relevant and irrelevant matters is not unassailable.
The limits of the boundary dividing questions of fact and questions of law were laid down by this court in Meenakshi Mills, Madurai v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Madras (1) where the question for decision was whether certain profits made and shown in the name of certain intermediaries were in fact profits actually earned by the assessee or the intermediaries. Taking the course of dealings and the extent of the transaction and the position of the intermediaries and all the evidence into consideration the Tribunal came to the conclusion that the intermediaries were dummies brought into existence by the appellant for concealing the true amount of profits and that the sales in their name were sham and fictitious and profits were actually earned by the assessee.

rights of the parties on an application of the appropriate principles of law to the facts ascertained. The law was thus summed up at p. 720:
In the instant case the Appellate Tribunal in its appellate order has set out the amount of profits made by the assessee company in the years of assessment 1943-44 to 1948-49. It has also mentioned the inconsistent positions taken up by the assessee in first claiming to be a dealer and then to be an investor which according to the Tribunal was due to the fact that it was incurring losses in the earlier years and had begun making profits when the claim of being an investor was put forward. But the two basic facts on which the Tribunal has based its findings are:
Counsel for the assessee relies on the decision of Kishan Prasad & Co., Ltd. v. Commissioner of Incometax, Punjab (1) where this Court held that the circumstance whether a transaction is or is not within the powers of the company has no bearing on the nature of the transaction or on the question whether the profits arising therefrom are capital or revenue income and, therefore, it is contended that the Tribunal has (1) [1955] 27 I.T.R. 49.
relied upon an irrelevant circumstance. Counsel for Revenue on the other hand refer to the judgment in Lakshminarayan Ram Gopal v. Government of Hyderabad (1) where the objects of an incorporated company were held not to be conclusive but relevant for the purpose of determining the nature and scope of its activities. Merely because the company has within its objects the dealing in investment in shares does not give to it the characteristics of a dealer in shares. But if other circumstances are proved it may be a relevant consideration for the purpose of determining the nature of activities of an assessee. Whether in the instant case it will have any relevance because of other materials on which the assessee company was relying in support of its case that it was merely an investor and not a dealer will have to be considered when the suggested questions of law are answered. As to what are the characteristics of the business of dealing in shares or that of an investor is a mixed question of fact and law. What is the legal effect of the facts found by the Tribunal and whether as a result the assessee can be termed a dealer or an investor is itself a question of law.
The questions of law that arise out of the order of the Tribunal are:
We would therefore allow this appeal, set aside the order of the High Court and remit the case to the High Court for directing the Tribunal to state a case on the aforesaid two questions. The appellant will have its costs in this Court and in the High Court for the proceedings so far taken. Further costs will be in the discretion of the High Court. Appeal allowed. Case remitted.
