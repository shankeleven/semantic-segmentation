The New Jehangir Vakil Mills Ltd vs The Commissioner Of Income-Tax, ... on 12 May, 1959	Case Title
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 50 of 1957. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated September 23, 1955, of the Bombay High Court in Income-tax Reference No. 19 of 1955.
Being aggrieved by the said decision of the Tribunal, the respondent (Commissioner of Income-tax) filed two applications under s. 66(1) of the Act requesting the Tribunal to draw up a statement of the case and refer the question of law arising out of the order of the Tribunal to the High Court.
The appellant filed a petition in the High Court on November 22, 1955, for the grant of a certificate under S. 66A(2) of the Act to appeal to this Court from the said judgment and order of the High Court. This application was dismissed by the High Court by its order dated December 8, 1955, with the result that the appellant presented on December 22, 1955, a petition in this Court for special leave to appeal from the said judgment of the High Court dated September 23, 1955. This Court by its order dated March 12, 1956, granted special leave to appeal, such leave being limited to the question whether the High Court had jurisdiction under section 66(4) of the Act to call for a supplemental statement of case. This is how the appeal has come up for hearing and final disposal before us.	Issue
R. J. Kolah and I. N. Shroff for the appellant. H. N. Sanyal, Additional Solicitor-General of India, K. N. Rajagopala Sastri and D. Gupta, for the respondent. 1959. May 12. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATIJ.-This appeal with special leave arises out of a judgment and order of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay dated September 23, 1955, delivered in Income Tax Reference No. 19 of 1955 made by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as " the Tribunal ") to the Pligh Court under s. 66(1) of the Indian Income-tax Act (XI of 1922)-(hereinafter referred to as " the Act ") whereby the High Court directed the Tribunal to submit a supplementary statement of case on the points mentioned therein. The appellant is a limited liability company manufacturing textile goods at Bhavnagar which was an Indian State during the assessment years 1943-44 and 1944-45. For the said assessment years the appellant was held to be a non- resident, its years of account being calendar years 1942 and 1943. For the assessment years 1943-44 and 1944-45 (account years 1942, and 1943), the Income-tax Officer computed the British' Indian Income of the appellant on a proportionate basis under s. 4(1)(a) of the Act. In the account year 1942 its total sales amounted to Rs. 66,14,852 out of which sale proceeds amounting to Rs. 35,92,157 as detailed below were held by the Income-tax Officer to have been received in British India:-
In the said applications the facts which were admitted and/or found by the Tribunal and which were necessary for drawing up a statement of the case were stated as under:-
We have narrated the facts and events leading up to this appeal in such detail in order that we may have the proper perspective and the background against which the High Court directed the Tribunal to submit a supplementary statement of case on the points mentioned therein. The appeal raises an important question as to the nature, scope and extent of the jurisdiction vested in the High Court under section 66(4) of the Act and we shall now address ourselves to that question.	Facts
It may be pointed out that neither did the Incometax Officer, when the proceedings were before him, or when the proceedings were before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, nor did the Revenue, when the proceedings were before the Tribunal, at any stage contend that the cheques aggregating to the said amounts in the said two years were not received at Bhavnagar because of the alleged posting of the cheques in British India and/or by reason of the allega- tion that the cheques were sent by post and/or that the post office was the agent of the appellant and that too, in spite of the decision in the case of Kirloskar Bros. Ltd. which decision had already been pronounced by then and where the said question had been debated and argued by the Revenue. The only ground urged by the Revenue at all material stages was that because the amounts which were received, from the merchants or the Government, were received by cheques drawn on Banks in British India which were ultimately encashed in British India, the monies could not be said to have been received in Bhavnagar though the cheques were in fact received at Bhavnagar.
In the result, the High Court directed that a supplementary statement of case should be submitted by the Tribunal on the following points:-	PetArg
in this Court against that decision of the Bombay High Court the Tribunal further stated:-
In respect of the assessment year 1944-45, the Tribunal, after directing the Income-tax Officer to verify the correctness of the figure of the amounts received by the appellant by cheques from the Government (i. e., whether it was Rs. 12,97,631 as contended for by the appellant or Rs. 16,72,693 as held by the Income-tax Officer or any other figure), held that the cheques representing the said amount were received at Bhavnagar and the monies or sale proceeds were also received in Bhavnagar. The Tribunal also held that another amount of Rs. 5,53,447 in respect of the said latter year, being the aggregate amount of the cheques received at Bhavnagar from other merchants was also received in Bhavnagar.
The High Court further observed that the burden would be upon the Revenue to establish that the cheques which were received by post were so received at the request express or implied of the appellant and that therefore the Post Office was the agent of the appellant. But it observed in this context:-
tions had been in accordance with law. In hearing a reference under section 66(1), this Court does not sit in appeal from the assessment and it is not called upon to give its advice on matters which the Tribunal was not asked to decide and which the Tribunal neither decided, nor included in the statement of case for the opinion of this Court." The Bombay High Court also expressed the same opinion in the case of Industrial Development and Investments Co., Ltd. v. Commissioner of Excess Profits Tax, Bombay (1), Chagla, C.J., who delivered the judgment of the Court pointed out to the Tribunal what the correct procedure was with regard to the submission of a statement of the case and observed:-
The other is the decision of this Court in Commissioner of Income-tax v. Bhurangya Coal Co. (1), where Venkatarama Aiyar, J., dealt with a similar argument which was addressed before this Court at p. 805 :-
The decision of the Privy Council in Sir Sunder Singh Majithia v. Commissioner of Income-tax, C. P. and U. P. (1) was also referred to by the Revenue in this context. In that case the question of law which was formulated was in the following terms:-
the nature, scope and extent of the jurisdiction of the High Court under s. 66(4) of the Act was not specific-, ally discussed and the only order which was passed was that the case be remanded to the High Court for disposal after taking such action under sub-section (4) of s. 66 of the Act as the High Court might think fit in the light of the judgment. The same observations which we have made earlier while discussing the case of Commissioner of Incometax v. Visweshwar Singh (1) would apply to this case also and the observations of the Privy Council really do not militate against the position as we have laid down above.
found by the Tribunal as stated in the said applications for reference took count of the position as it had been adopted by the Revenue in all these proceedings and it could not by any stretch of imagination be urged that the question now sought to be mooted was ever in the minds of the Revenue. The question of law which was referred by the Tribunal to the High Court for its decision was:-
- a question quite distinct and separate from the question of law which was actually referred by the Tribunal to the High Court in the statement of the case drawn on November 5, 1954.	Precedent
15,67,967 made to the Government of India and other customers were received in British India within the meaning of section 4(1)(a) of the Indian Income-tax Act. "
The relevant provision of sec. 66 of the Act may now be referred to :-
On the conditions of s. 66(1) and s. 66(2) being thus complied with the statement of case has to be drawn up by the Tribunal and the question of law arising out of its order referred to the High Court for its opinion. This statement of case which is based, as stated above, on the facts which are admitted and/or found by the Tribunal may not contain sufficient material to enable the High Court to determine the question raised thereby and in that case the High Court under s. 66(4) is vested with the jurisdiction to refer the case back to the Tribunal to make such additions thereto or alterations therein as the Court may direct in that behalf only for the purpose of determining the question referred to it. If the question actually referred does not bring out clearly the real issue between the parties, the High Court may reframe the question so that the matter actually agitated before the Tribunal may be raised before the High Court. But s. 66(4) does not enable the High Court to raise a new question of law which does not arise out. of the Tribunal's order and direct the Tribunal to investigate new or further facts necessary to determine this new question which had not been referred to it under s. 66(1) or s. 66(2) and direct the Tribunal to submit a supplementary statement of case. This power and jurisdiction which is vested in the High Court is to be exercised within the four corners of s. 66. If under s. 66(1) and s. 66(2) the statement of case has to be drawn up on the basis of the facts which are admitted and/or found by the Tribunal and this is the requirement also of para. 3 of the prescribed form-the scope of such statement of case cannot, in our opinion, be in any manner enlarged by the power which is given to the High Court under s. 66(4) to make such additions thereto or alterations therein in the statement of case as the Court may direct in that behalf. The jurisdiction of the High Court under s. 66 is a consultative or advisory jurisdiction. In order to satisfactorily discharge that advisory jurisdiction the High Court must have before it all the facts which are admitted and/or found by the Tribunal properly set out in the Statements in the case. It is only in those cases where the statement of case referred to the High Court under s. 66(1) and s. 66(2) are not sufficient to enable the High, Court to determine the question raised thereby that the High Court is empowered to refer the case back to the Tribunal, so that the Tribunal within the four corners of s. 66(1) and s. 66(2) may make such additions to those statements or alterations therein as may be directed by the Court. Even though the terms of s. 66(4) are wide enough to comprise "	Section
34 (1) [1957] 32 I.T.R. 569, 573.
We are, therefore, of opinion that the High Court was in error in not deciding the reference before it and answering the question on the facts disclosed in the statement of case. We are also of opinion that in the circumstances of this case the High Court had no jurisdiction under s. 66(4) to direct the Tribunal to submit a supplementary statement of case on the points mentioned in its judgment. The result, therefore, is that the appeal will be allowed and the matter remanded to the High Court to arrive at its decision on the question of law referred to it in the statement of case already submitted to it by the Tribunal. The respondent will pay the appellant's costs throughout. Appeal allowed.	Conclusion
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 50 of 1957. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated September 23, 1955, of the Bombay High Court in Income-tax Reference No. 19 of 1955.
R. J. Kolah and I. N. Shroff for the appellant. H. N. Sanyal, Additional Solicitor-General of India, K. N. Rajagopala Sastri and D. Gupta, for the respondent. 1959. May 12. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATIJ.-This appeal with special leave arises out of a judgment and order of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay dated September 23, 1955, delivered in Income Tax Reference No. 19 of 1955 made by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal (hereinafter referred to as " the Tribunal ") to the Pligh Court under s. 66(1) of the Indian Income-tax Act (XI of 1922)-(hereinafter referred to as " the Act ") whereby the High Court directed the Tribunal to submit a supplementary statement of case on the points mentioned therein. The appellant is a limited liability company manufacturing textile goods at Bhavnagar which was an Indian State during the assessment years 1943-44 and 1944-45. For the said assessment years the appellant was held to be a non- resident, its years of account being calendar years 1942 and 1943. For the assessment years 1943-44 and 1944-45 (account years 1942, and 1943), the Income-tax Officer computed the British' Indian Income of the appellant on a proportionate basis under s. 4(1)(a) of the Act. In the account year 1942 its total sales amounted to Rs. 66,14,852 out of which sale proceeds amounting to Rs. 35,92,157 as detailed below were held by the Income-tax Officer to have been received in British India:-
in this Court against that decision of the Bombay High Court the Tribunal further stated:-
In respect of the assessment year 1944-45, the Tribunal, after directing the Income-tax Officer to verify the correctness of the figure of the amounts received by the appellant by cheques from the Government (i. e., whether it was Rs. 12,97,631 as contended for by the appellant or Rs. 16,72,693 as held by the Income-tax Officer or any other figure), held that the cheques representing the said amount were received at Bhavnagar and the monies or sale proceeds were also received in Bhavnagar. The Tribunal also held that another amount of Rs. 5,53,447 in respect of the said latter year, being the aggregate amount of the cheques received at Bhavnagar from other merchants was also received in Bhavnagar.
It may be pointed out that neither did the Incometax Officer, when the proceedings were before him, or when the proceedings were before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, nor did the Revenue, when the proceedings were before the Tribunal, at any stage contend that the cheques aggregating to the said amounts in the said two years were not received at Bhavnagar because of the alleged posting of the cheques in British India and/or by reason of the allega- tion that the cheques were sent by post and/or that the post office was the agent of the appellant and that too, in spite of the decision in the case of Kirloskar Bros. Ltd. which decision had already been pronounced by then and where the said question had been debated and argued by the Revenue. The only ground urged by the Revenue at all material stages was that because the amounts which were received, from the merchants or the Government, were received by cheques drawn on Banks in British India which were ultimately encashed in British India, the monies could not be said to have been received in Bhavnagar though the cheques were in fact received at Bhavnagar.
Being aggrieved by the said decision of the Tribunal, the respondent (Commissioner of Income-tax) filed two applications under s. 66(1) of the Act requesting the Tribunal to draw up a statement of the case and refer the question of law arising out of the order of the Tribunal to the High Court.
In the said applications the facts which were admitted and/or found by the Tribunal and which were necessary for drawing up a statement of the case were stated as under:-
15,67,967 made to the Government of India and other customers were received in British India within the meaning of section 4(1)(a) of the Indian Income-tax Act. "
of the fact that the assessees in the said two appeals had expressly requested the Government to remit the amounts by cheques, the assessees had constituted the Post Office their agent to receive, on their respective behaves, the said cheques which were posted by the Government at Delhi having addressed them to the assessees outside British India. In spite of the said decisions, the Revenue did not urge before the Tribunal that the said aspect of the matter should in the present case also be referred to the High Court for its decision and the Reference applications were heard on the materials which were on the record before the Tribunal when it made its orders dated July 17, 1952. The said order of the Tribunal was based on the facts admitted and/or found by the Tribunal as stated in the Reference Applications made by the Revenue as aforesaid and this aspect of the case, viz., whether any portion of these cheques were received by post and if so whether there was any request by the appellant express or implied that the amounts of those cheques should be remitted to Bhavnagar by post, had certainly not been canvassed before any of the income-tax authorities or before the Tribunal and did not find its place in the order of the Tribunal and any question of law appertaining thereto could not be said to arise out of the said order of the Tribunal.
On the materials as they stood on the record then, the Tribunal drew up on November 5, 1952, a statement of case in which all the facts and events above referred to were set out. Besides the same the Tribunal also referred in para. 8 thereof to two letters on the record which showed that the cheques from the Supply Department were received by post. It also annexed a sample agreement form on record between the appellant and its customers other than the Government and annexed thereto the copies of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner's orders for the assessment years 1943-44 and 1944-45. The two letters showing that the cheques from the Supply Department were received by post were evidently put in with a view to show that the order of the Tribunal dated July 17, 1952, was correct in making the presumption that the letters containing the cheques were addressed to the, appellant at Bhavnagar and in holding that the cheques were received from the Government at Bhavnagar. There was no other reason, so% far as the record then stood, to make any reference to the said two letters. Out of the facts stated above the Tribunal raised the following question of law:-
The High Court further observed that the burden would be upon the Revenue to establish that the cheques which were received by post were so received at the request express or implied of the appellant and that therefore the Post Office was the agent of the appellant. But it observed in this context:-
In the result, the High Court directed that a supplementary statement of case should be submitted by the Tribunal on the following points:-
The appellant filed a petition in the High Court on November 22, 1955, for the grant of a certificate under S. 66A(2) of the Act to appeal to this Court from the said judgment and order of the High Court. This application was dismissed by the High Court by its order dated December 8, 1955, with the result that the appellant presented on December 22, 1955, a petition in this Court for special leave to appeal from the said judgment of the High Court dated September 23, 1955. This Court by its order dated March 12, 1956, granted special leave to appeal, such leave being limited to the question whether the High Court had jurisdiction under section 66(4) of the Act to call for a supplemental statement of case. This is how the appeal has come up for hearing and final disposal before us.
We have narrated the facts and events leading up to this appeal in such detail in order that we may have the proper perspective and the background against which the High Court directed the Tribunal to submit a supplementary statement of case on the points mentioned therein. The appeal raises an important question as to the nature, scope and extent of the jurisdiction vested in the High Court under section 66(4) of the Act and we shall now address ourselves to that question.
The relevant provision of sec. 66 of the Act may now be referred to :-
It is clear on a plain reading of the terms of s. 66(1) that the only question of law which the assesssee or the Commissioner can require the Tribunal to refer to the High Court is " any question of law arising out of the order of the Tribunal " so that if the question of law which the assessee or the Commissioner requires the Tribunal to so refer to the High Court does not arise out of its order the Tribunal is not bound to refer the same. What has therefore to be looked at in the first instance is whether the question of law thus required to be referred arises out of the order of the Tribunal. The Tribunal no doubt has got before it #he facts which are admitted and/or found by the Tribunal and which are necessary for drawing up a statement of the case and it is the facts admitted and/or found by it that would form the basis on which the statement of case would be drawn and references of the question of law made by the Tribunal to the High Court. If such facts were not there whether in the order of the Tribunal or in the record before it there would certainly not be any foundation for the raising of any question of law either in the abstract or otherwise and it is only a question of law which would arise out of such facts which are admitted and/or found by the Tribunal that would be the substratum of the reference to the High Court. The facts admitted aD.d/or found by the Tribunal would really be the foundation or the basis on which such questions of law could be raised and neither party would be entitled to require the Tribunal to refer to the High Court any question of law which could not thus arise out of the order of the Tribunal. Section 66(2) which gives the power to the High Court to require the Tribunal to state the case and refer the question of law to it also proceeds on the same basis and even where the High Court exercises the power under s. 66(2) it can only require the Tribunal to state the case on any question of law arising out of such order.' The scope and subject-matter of the reference under s. 66(2) therefore is co-extensive with that of the reference under s. 66(1) of the Act and the High Court has no power or jurisdiction under s. 66(2) to travel beyond the ambit of s. 66(1). Section 66(2) comes into play only when the Tribunal refuses to state the case on the ground that no question of law arises and if the High Court is not satisfied of the correctness of the decision of the Tribunal, it has got the power and jurisdiction to require the Tribunal to state the case and refer the same to it.
On the conditions of s. 66(1) and s. 66(2) being thus complied with the statement of case has to be drawn up by the Tribunal and the question of law arising out of its order referred to the High Court for its opinion. This statement of case which is based, as stated above, on the facts which are admitted and/or found by the Tribunal may not contain sufficient material to enable the High Court to determine the question raised thereby and in that case the High Court under s. 66(4) is vested with the jurisdiction to refer the case back to the Tribunal to make such additions thereto or alterations therein as the Court may direct in that behalf only for the purpose of determining the question referred to it. If the question actually referred does not bring out clearly the real issue between the parties, the High Court may reframe the question so that the matter actually agitated before the Tribunal may be raised before the High Court. But s. 66(4) does not enable the High Court to raise a new question of law which does not arise out. of the Tribunal's order and direct the Tribunal to investigate new or further facts necessary to determine this new question which had not been referred to it under s. 66(1) or s. 66(2) and direct the Tribunal to submit a supplementary statement of case. This power and jurisdiction which is vested in the High Court is to be exercised within the four corners of s. 66. If under s. 66(1) and s. 66(2) the statement of case has to be drawn up on the basis of the facts which are admitted and/or found by the Tribunal and this is the requirement also of para. 3 of the prescribed form-the scope of such statement of case cannot, in our opinion, be in any manner enlarged by the power which is given to the High Court under s. 66(4) to make such additions thereto or alterations therein in the statement of case as the Court may direct in that behalf. The jurisdiction of the High Court under s. 66 is a consultative or advisory jurisdiction. In order to satisfactorily discharge that advisory jurisdiction the High Court must have before it all the facts which are admitted and/or found by the Tribunal properly set out in the Statements in the case. It is only in those cases where the statement of case referred to the High Court under s. 66(1) and s. 66(2) are not sufficient to enable the High, Court to determine the question raised thereby that the High Court is empowered to refer the case back to the Tribunal, so that the Tribunal within the four corners of s. 66(1) and s. 66(2) may make such additions to those statements or alterations therein as may be directed by the Court. Even though the terms of s. 66(4) are wide enough to comprise "
tions had been in accordance with law. In hearing a reference under section 66(1), this Court does not sit in appeal from the assessment and it is not called upon to give its advice on matters which the Tribunal was not asked to decide and which the Tribunal neither decided, nor included in the statement of case for the opinion of this Court." The Bombay High Court also expressed the same opinion in the case of Industrial Development and Investments Co., Ltd. v. Commissioner of Excess Profits Tax, Bombay (1), Chagla, C.J., who delivered the judgment of the Court pointed out to the Tribunal what the correct procedure was with regard to the submission of a statement of the case and observed:-
34 (1) [1957] 32 I.T.R. 569, 573.
The other is the decision of this Court in Commissioner of Income-tax v. Bhurangya Coal Co. (1), where Venkatarama Aiyar, J., dealt with a similar argument which was addressed before this Court at p. 805 :-
If there is no power in the High Court to remand the case to the Tribunal for fresh findings of facts on further enquiry in the manner stated above, much less would the High Court have the power while exercising its jurisdiction under s. 66(4) of the Act to (1) [1958] 34 I.T.R. 802, 805, refer the case back to the Tribunal to make such additions thereto or alterations therein as the Court may direct as would require the Tribunal to embark upon a fresh line of enquiry which had never been canvassed at any time before the Income-tax authorities or the Tribunal in the first instance and record fresh findings on evidence adduced by the parties in that behalf.
Our attention was drawn on behalf of the Revenue to the observations of Fazl Ali, J. (as he then was) in the Commissioner of Income-tax, Bihar & Orissa v. Visweshwar Singh(') where the learned Judge dealt with the procedure adopted by the Commissioner of Income-tax in sending up the reference in question. The High Court sent the matter back to the Commissioner in order that he may re-state the statement of case. When the matter went back to the Commis- sioner he sent up a restatement of the case, but unfortunately without hearing the assessee. The High Court sent the re-stated case back to the Commissioner once again in order that the case might be re-stated with such further finding of fact as the Commissioner may consider necessary after hearing the assessee. The matter then went back to another Commissioner who instead of re-stating the case, as he was ordered by the High Court to do, sent up a letter to the High Court stating that he had not heard the party in regard to the opinion of the Commissioner, and that in any event he should not consider that he had power within s. 66(4) to vary an opinion given under s. 66(2) if no new facts were admitted. The learned Judge pointed out that the Commissioner was in duty bound to carry out the order of the High Court and he should have re-heard the parties, admitted such further evidence as he considered relevant on the point at issue and re-stated the case with his opinion thereon. It is not clear, however, from the record as to whether the re-hearing of the parties and the recording of such further finding as was considered relevant on the point at issue embraced a fresh line of enquiry which had not been entertained at any earlier stage of the proceedings or was merely (1) [1939] 7 I.T.R. 536,554.
by way of elucidation of the very same points at issue which had been canvassed earlier but had not been thrashed out completely and properly reflected in the finding of the Tribunal. These observations, in our opinion, do not make any difference to the position that we have adopted herein, viz., it is not open to the High Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction under s. 66(4) of the Act to raise a new question and to require the Tribunal to entertain a fresh line of enquiry, hear the parties in regard to the same and record fresh finding of fact which would enable either the assessee or the Commissioner to advance a case which had never been made by it before the Income tax authorities or the Tribunal and which therefore could not be said to arise out of the order of the Tribunal.
The decision of the Privy Council in Sir Sunder Singh Majithia v. Commissioner of Income-tax, C. P. and U. P. (1) was also referred to by the Revenue in this context. In that case the question of law which was formulated was in the following terms:-
the nature, scope and extent of the jurisdiction of the High Court under s. 66(4) of the Act was not specific-, ally discussed and the only order which was passed was that the case be remanded to the High Court for disposal after taking such action under sub-section (4) of s. 66 of the Act as the High Court might think fit in the light of the judgment. The same observations which we have made earlier while discussing the case of Commissioner of Incometax v. Visweshwar Singh (1) would apply to this case also and the observations of the Privy Council really do not militate against the position as we have laid down above.
On the facts of the present case before us it is abundantly clear that the only question which was canvassed before the Income-tax authorities and the Tribunal before it made its order dated July 17, 1952, was whether the cheques which were received at Bhavnagar having been cashed in British India, the monies in respect of the same should be said to have been received in British India and the Tribunal had held following the case of Kirloskar Brothers' Case that the cheques were received from the Government at Bhavnagar and the receipt of money in respect of these cheques from Banks in British India related back to the receipt of the cheque at Bhavnagar and therefore was also received in Bhavnagar. At no time was the question as regards the posting of the cheques in British India (Delhi) at the request, express or implied, of the appellant and the consequent receipt of the sale proceeds in British India ever mooted before the Income-tax authorities or the Tribunal before the Tribunal made its order on July 17, 1952, or even in the reference applications filed on September 15, 1952, nor was the said question mooted before the Tribunal when it heard the reference and drew up the statement of case on November 5, 1954, even though this Court had pronounced its decision in Kirloskar Brothers' Case (1) and the Commissioner of Income- tax, Bombay South v. Messrs. Ogale Glass Works Ltd. (2) on April 19, 1954. The facts admitted and/or (1) [1939] 7 I.T.R. 536, 554. (2) [1954] 25 I.T.R. 547. (3) [1955] 1 S. C. R. 185.
found by the Tribunal as stated in the said applications for reference took count of the position as it had been adopted by the Revenue in all these proceedings and it could not by any stretch of imagination be urged that the question now sought to be mooted was ever in the minds of the Revenue. The question of law which was referred by the Tribunal to the High Court for its decision was:-
- a question quite distinct and separate from the question of law which was actually referred by the Tribunal to the High Court in the statement of the case drawn on November 5, 1954.
We are, therefore, of opinion that the High Court was in error in not deciding the reference before it and answering the question on the facts disclosed in the statement of case. We are also of opinion that in the circumstances of this case the High Court had no jurisdiction under s. 66(4) to direct the Tribunal to submit a supplementary statement of case on the points mentioned in its judgment. The result, therefore, is that the appeal will be allowed and the matter remanded to the High Court to arrive at its decision on the question of law referred to it in the statement of case already submitted to it by the Tribunal. The respondent will pay the appellant's costs throughout. Appeal allowed.	Total Judgement
