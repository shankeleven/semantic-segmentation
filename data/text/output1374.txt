1959. January 20. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS, C. J.-This is an appeal filed upon a certificate of fitness granted by the High Court of Calcutta impugning the judgment pronounced by the said High Court on January 23, 1953, declaring null and void an award (No. 209 of 1952) made by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce in case No. 855 of 1951, whereby they ordered the respondent company to pay to the appellant company a sum of Rs. 1,95,000 besides interest and costs.	Issue
The facts giving rise to the present appeal are simple and may briefly be summarised as follows: On April 6, 1951, the appellant company entered into a contract with the respondent company for the supply of 5,000 maunds of Nikhli and/or Ashuganj Jute on certain prices according to quality, " shipment during July and/or August, 1951, guaranteed ". That contract, which was entered into by bought and sold notes exchanged between the parties through brokers, con- tained a very wide arbitration clause. When shipping documents were presented to the respondent company by the bankers of the appellant company, they were not honoured on the plea that the same were not in order and the respondent company failed to take delivery of the goods. The last date on which the documents were so presented was September 17, 1951. On September 26, 1951, the appellant company, through their solicitors, wrote to the respondent company intimating that they had exercised their option of cancelling the contract and demanding the payment of the sum of Rs. 1,95,000 as damages on the basis of the difference between the contract price and the market price of the goods as on September 17, 1951. The respondent company having by their letter dated October 25, 1951, denied their liability to pay any amount, the appellant company on November 2, 1951, referred the dispute to the arbitration of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce in terms of the arbitration clause contained in that contract. The respondent company submitted to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal of arbitration by appearing and adducing evidence before it. On February 29, 1952, the arbitrators made their award by which they allowed the claim of the appellant company in full with interest and costs. The award having been filed in the Calcutta High Court on April 23, 1952, the respondent company on June 9,1952, filed an application in that Court praying, inter alia, that the award be declared null and void and be set aside. The main ground urged in that application was that the award was a nullity in that the contract containing the arbitration clause was void under the provisions of the Raw Jute (Central Jute Board and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1951, (W. Ben. VI of 1951) which was then in force. In order to appreciate the points raised before the High Court and before us it is necessary at this stage to refer to some of the statutory provisions bearing on the question. To regulate the prices of jute and to empower the Government to fix its maximum prices, the West Bengal Legislature passed an Act called the West Bengal Jute (Control of Prices) Act, 1950, (W. Ben. VI of 1950) which came into force on March 15,1950. On December 14,1950, the Government of West Bengal promulgated an Ordinance called the Raw Jute (Central Jute Board and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, 1950 (XVII of 1950) for the better regulation of the jute trade. The preamble to that Ordinance recited that, as the owners of jute mills were not being able to secure adequate supplies of jute on the maximum prices fixed under the West Bengal Jute (Control of Prices) Act, 1950, it had become expedient to set up a Central Jute Board in West Bengal for ensuring an equitable supply of raw jute to the owners of the jute mills. That Ordinance consisted of only 15 sections. Section.4 of that Ordinance provided for the constitution of the Central Jute Board. Section 5 was expressed in the following terms :-	Facts
Section 6 laid down the manner in which all contracts for the sale or supply of raw jute with the owners of jute mills were to be entered into. Section 7 ran as follows:-
The expression " appointed day " occurring in s. 7 (3) quoted above was thus defined in s. 2 (1) of that Ordinance :-
The said Ordinance was subsequently replaced by an Act called the Raw Jute (Central Jute Board and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act (W. Ben. Act VI of 1951), hereinafter referred to as " the Act ", which came into force on March
21., 1951. The first fifteen sections of the Act were almost verbatim reproductions of the fifteen sections of the Ordinance and only one new section was added as the sixteenth section reading as follows:-
of the charter party and to insert it in and to read it as a part of the bill of lading. It was held that so read it became insensible, for an arbitration clause referring all disputes arising out of the charter party was wholly out of place and meaningless as a term of the bill of lading. A cursory perusal of s. 16 will, however, show that there are two fictions created by that section: One is that the Act shall be deemed to have commenced on December 14, 1950, and the other is that the notification issued under the Ordinance shall be deemed to have been issued under the Act. If the Act fictionally commenced on December 14, 1950, then the Ordinance would have to be treated as not promulgated at all, for the two could not have coexisted and when the Act provided that the notification, which, for identification, is described as having been issued under the Ordinance, should be deemed to have been made under the Act then, unless we read the word " Ordinance " 7 as " Act ", we do not give full effect to the twin fictions created by the Act. In other words the creation of the statutory fictions compels us to adopt the principle of mutatis mutandis and to substitute the word " Act " for the word " Ordinance " used in the notification, so as to give full effect to the fictions created by the statute. We see no reason in support of the contentions of the Attorney General that the fiction raised by s. 16 stops short at mere issuing of the notification. The ambit of the fiction appears to us to cover not only the issuance of the notification but to extend to our reading it as having been one issued under the Act. We cannot read it as having been issued under the Act unless we read the word " Ordinance " used in the notification as " Act ".	Section
No other point has been urged before us and for reasons stated above this appeal must be dismissed. In view of the circumstances referred to in the judgment of the High Court and appearing in the record we make no order for costs of this appeal.
Appeal dismissed.	Conclusion

The expression " appointed day " occurring in s. 7 (3) quoted above was thus defined in s. 2 (1) of that Ordinance :-
By a notification dated December 29, 1950, published in an extraordinary issue of the Calcutta Gazette of the same date, December 30, 1950, was specified as " the appointed day for the purposes of ss. 5, 6 and 7 of the said Ordinance."
The said Ordinance was subsequently replaced by an Act called the Raw Jute (Central Jute Board and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act (W. Ben. Act VI of 1951), hereinafter referred to as " the Act ", which came into force on March
21., 1951. The first fifteen sections of the Act were almost verbatim reproductions of the fifteen sections of the Ordinance and only one new section was added as the sixteenth section reading as follows:-
