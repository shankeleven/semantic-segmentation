Rattan Anmol Singh And Another vs Atma Ram And Others on 21 May, 1954	Case Title
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeals Nos. 213A and 213B of 1953.
Appeals by Special Leave against the Judgment and Order dated the 24th June, 1953, of the Election Tribunal, Ludhiana, in Election Petition No. 153 of 1952. C. K. Daphtary, Solicitor-General for India, (Harbans Singh Doabia and Rajinder Narain, with him) for the appellant in Civil Appeal No. 213A.
Tilak Raj Bhasin and Harbans Singh for respondent No. 2 in Civil Appeal No. 213A and the appellant in Civil Appeal No. 213B.
Naunit Lal for respondents Nos. 3 and 19 in both the appeals.
1954. May 21. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BOSE J.-These are two appeals against the decision of the Election Tribunal at Ludhiana.
The main question we have to decide is whether the Returning Officer was right in rejecting the petitioner's nomination papers. The facts which led him to do so are as follows. The Rules require that each nomination paper should be "subscribed" by a proposer and a seconder. The petitioner put in four papers. In each case, the proposer and seconder were illiterate and so placed a thumb-mark instead of a signature. But these thumb-marks were not "attested". The Returning Officer held that without "attestation" they are invalid and so rejected them. The main question is whether he was right in so holding. A subsidiary question also arises, namely, whether, assuming attestation to be necessary under the Rules, an omission to obtain the required attestation' amounts to a technical defect of an unsubstantial character which the Returning Officer was bound to disregard under section 36(4) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (XLIII of 1951).	Issue
The contest was for two seats in the Pun jab Legislative Assembly. The constituency is a double member constituency, one seat being general and the other reserved for a Scheduled Caste. The first respondent is Atma Ram. He was a candidate for the reserved seat but his nomination was rejected by the Returning Officer at the scrutiny stage and so he was unable to contest the election. The successful candidates were Rattan Anmol Singh, the appellant in Civil Appeal No. 213-A of 1953, for the general seat and Ram Prakash, the appellant in Civil Appeal No. 213-B of 1953 for there served. Atma Ram filed the present election petition. The Election :Tribunal decided in his favour by a majority of two to one and declared the whole election void. Rattan Anmol Singh and Ram Prakash appeal here.	Facts

Section 33(1) of the Act requires each candidate to "deliver to the Returning Officer...... a nomination paper completed in the prescribed form and subscribed by the candidate himself as assenting to the nomination and by two persons referred to in sub-section (2) as proposer and seconder."
Sub-section (2) says that-

It is clear that the word can be used in various senses to indicate different modes of signing and that it includes the placing of a mark. The General Clauses Act also says that-
of the Representation of the People Act show that the writing of a signature and the making of a mark are to be treated differently.
The learned counsel for the respondent-analysed the Act for us and pointed out that the word " subscribe " is only used in Chapter I of Part V dealing with the Nomination of Candidates while in every other place the word " sign " is used. We do not know why this should be unless, as was suggested by the learned Solicitor-General, the Legislature wished to underline the fact that the proposer and seconder are not merely signing by way of attesting the candidate's signature to the nomination form but are actually themselves putting the man forward as a suitable candidate for election and as a person for whom they are prepared to vouch, also that the candidate's signature imports more than a mere vouching for the accuracy of the facts entered in the form. It imports assent to his nomination. We think the learned Solicitor-General is probably right because section 33 speaks of "a nomination paper completed in the prescribed form and subscribed by the. candidate himself as assenting to the nomination."
But however that may be, it.is evident from the form that "

must be authenticated in " such manner as may be pres- cribed." The prescribed manner is to be found in rule 2(2)of the Representation of the People (Conduct of Elections and Election Petitions) Rules, 1951. It runs as follows :
In view of this we are clear that attestation in the prescribed manner is required in the case of proposers and seconders who are not able to write their names. The four nomination papers we are concerned with were not " signed " by the proposers and seconders in the usual way by writing their names, and as their marks are not attested it is evident that they have not been " signed ", in the special way which the Act requires in such cases. If they are not " signed " either in one way or the other, then it is clear that they have not been " subscribed " because " subscribing " imports a "signature" and as the Act sets out the only kinds of "signatures" which it will recognise as II signing" for the purposes of the Act, we are left with the position that there are no valid signatures of either a proposer or a seconder in any one of the four nomination papers. The Returning Officer was therefore bound to reject them under section 36(2)(d) of the Act because there was a failure to comply with section 33, unless he could and should have had resort to section 36(4). That sub-section is as follows. The Returning Officer shall not reject any nomination paper on the ground of any technical defect which is not of a substantial character."
The question therefore is whether attestation is a mere technical or unsubstantial requirement. We are not able to regard it in that light. When the law enjoins the observance of a particular formality it cannot be disregarded and the substance of the thing must be there. The substance of the matter here is the satisfaction of the Returning Officer at a particular moment of time about the identity of the person making _a mark in place of writing a signature. If the Returning Officer had omitted the attestation because of some slip on his part and it could be proved that he was satisfied at the proper time, the matter might be different because the element of his satisfaction at the proper time, which is of the substance, would be there, and the omission formally to record the satisfaction could probably, in a case like that, be regarded as an unsubstantial technicality. But we find it impossible to say that when the law requires the satisfaction of a particular officer at a particular time his satisfaction can be dispensed with altogether. In our opinion, this provision is as necessary and as substantial as attestation in the cases of a will or a mortgage and is on the same footing as the II subscribing " required in the case of the candidate himself If there is no signature and no mark the form would have to be rejected and their absence could not be dismissed as technical and unsubs- tantial. The "satisfaction " of the Returning Officer which the rules require is not, in our opinion, any the, less important and imperative.
The next question is whether the attestation can be compelled by the persons concerned at the scrutiny stage. It must be accepted that no attempt was made at the presentation stage to satisfy the Returning Officer about the identity of these persons but evidence was led to show that this was attempted at the scrutiny stage. The Returning Officer denies this, but even if the identities could have been proved to his satisfaction at that stage it would have been too late because the attestation and the satisfaction must exist at the presentation stage and a total omission of such an essential feature cannot be subsequently validated any more than the omission of a candidate to sign at all could have been. Section 36 is mandatory and enjoins the Returning Officer to refuse any nomination when there has been " any failure to comply with any of the provisions of section 33............... The only jurisdiction the Return- ing Officer has at the scrutiny stage is to see, whether the nominations are in order and to hear and decide objections. He cannot at that stage remedy essential defects or permit them to be remedied. It is true he is not to reject any nomination paper on the ground of any technical defect which is not of a substantial character but he cannot remedy the defect. He must leave it as it is. If it is technical and unsubstantial it will not matter. If it is not, it cannot be set right.
We agree with the Chairman of the Election Tribunal, that the Returning Officer rightly rejected these nomination papers. The appeals are allowed with costs and the order of the Election Tribunal declaring the elections of the two successful candidates to be wholly void is set aside. The election petition is dismissed, also with costs.
