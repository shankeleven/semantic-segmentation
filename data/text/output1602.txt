N.C. Chatterjee, J. H. Umrigar and T. M. Sen, for the respondents (In all the appeals).	Issue
1960. September 21. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SHAH J.-This is a group of three appeals filed with certificate of fitness under Art. 132 of the Constitution issued by the High Court of Judicature, Orissa. The Legislature of the Province of Orissa enacted the Orissa Agricultural Income-tax Act XXIV of 1947-hereinafter referred to as the Act-providing for the levy of income-tax on agricultural income derived from lands situated in the Province of Orissa. This Act was brought into operation from July 10, 1947. By s. 3, agricultural income-tax at the rate or rates specified in the schedule was made payable for each financial year on the total income of the previous year of every person. By the proviso to that section, agricultural income of the Central Government or of the State Government or of any local authority was exempt from 'taxation. Section 2, cl. (1), defined a " person " as inclusive of a Ruler of an Indian State. The appellant in these three appeals is the former Ruler of the State of Sonepur. After the establishment of the Dominion of India on August 15, 1947, the appellant as the Ruler of the State of Sonepur executed an instrument of accession to the., Dominion restricted to three subjects-Defence, External Affairs and Communications. On December 15, 1947, he executed a merger agreement whereby the territory of the State of Sonepur became merged with the territory of the Dominion of India. By virtue of the merger agreement, the Government of India acquired full sovereign rights over the territory of the State, but ownership of private properties belonging to the appellant and full enjoyment thereof were under the agreement guaranteed to him under Art. 3. In exercise of the powers conferred by the Extra Provincial Jurisdiction Act 47 of 1947, the Government of India by notification dated March 23, 1948, delegated to the Provincial Government of Orissa full powers to administer the merged States of Orissa including the State of Sonepur. The Government of the Province of Orissa applied to the merged States s. 1 of the Act as from January 19, 1949, and by notification dated April 1, 1949, the remaining provisions of the Act. In the meantime, by amendment, two new sections, s. 290(A) and s. 290(B) were incorporated in the Government of India Act, 1935. The Governor-General of India was thereby given power to direct by order that a merged State shall be administered in all respects as if it formed part of the Governor's Province specified in the order. The Governor-General of India exercising authority under ss. 290(A) and 290(B) issued on July 27, 1949, an order providing that the merged Orissa States including the State of Sonepur shall be administered in all respects as if they formed part of the Province of Orissa with effect from August 1, 1949. On December 30, 1949, the Governor of Orissa promulgated Ordinance No. IV of 1949 providing inter alia that the Agricultural Income-tax Act, 1947, be applied to the merged Orissa States. This Ordinance was later replaced by the Orissa Merged States (Laws) Act, XVI of 1950. The appellant was then called upon by the Agricultural Income-tax Officer to furnish a return of his agricultural income. The appellant disputed his liability to pay the agricultural income-tax and declined to furnish the return. The Agricultural Income-tax Officer then proceeded to make enquiries about the income received from the lands held by the appellant and assessed him to pay tax for the years 1949-50 to 1953-54. He also imposed a penalty upon the appellant for failure to submit his returns for the years 1949-50 and 1950-51. Against the order assessing him to tax and directing him to pay penalty, the appellant preferred appeals to the Assistant Collector of Agricultural Income-tax, Sambalpur. The appeals were dismissed by that officer. Revision applications to the Collector of Commercial Taxes, Cuttack and to the Board of Revenue were unsuccessful.
The appellant filed four petitions in the High Court of Orissa, being petitions Nos. 17, 16, 19 and 137 of 1954 challenging the assessments made by the taxing authorities for the years 1949-50, 1950-51, 1951-52 and 1952-53 respectively, and two more petitions being petitions Nos. 18 and 138 of 1954 against orders imposing penalty for the years 1949-50 and 1950-51 respectively. These six petitions and certain other petitions were heard by a Division Bench of the Orissa High Court. The High Court held that by the guarantee of full ownership, use and enjoyment of the private properties under the merger agreement the Properties of the appellant were not rendered immune from liability to pay tax imposed by the Act and that in the absence of an express provision, his income from lands was liable to pay agricultural income-tax. The High Court also held that even though the appellant was the Ruler of a former Orissa State, he was a " person " within the meaning of the Act and was liable to pay agricultural income-tax. The learned Judges therefore dismissed the petitions challenging the liability of the appellant for the assessment years 1950-51, 1951-52 and 1952-53 to pay agricultural income-tax, and they cancelled the order of assessment in respect of the year 1949-50 and the orders imposing penalty in respect of years 1949-50 and 1950-51. Against the orders dismissing the applications for setting aside the assessments in respect of years 1950-51, 1951-52 and 1952-53, these appeals have been preferred with certificate granted by the High Court under Art. 132 of the Constitution.
The appellant was undoubtedly the Ruler of an Indian State before August 15. 1947, but by reason of the merger agreement executed by him on December 15, 1947, his sovereignty was extinguished. By Art. 1 of the terms of the merger agreement, the appellant ceded to the Dominion of India full and exclusive authority, jurisdiction and power for and in relation to the governance of the State and agreed to transfer the administration of the State on the appointed day and as from the said day, the Dominion Government became competent to exercise the power, authority and jurisdiction in relation to the governance of the State in such matters and through such agency as the Government thought fit. By Art. 3, the appellant remained entitled to full ownership, use and enjoyment of all private properties (but not of the State properties) belonging to him on the date of the merger. By Art. 5, the Dominion Government gua- ranteed the succession according to law and customs, to the gadi of the State and to the personal rights, privileges, dignities and titles of the appellant. It was provided by Art. 4 that " the Raja, the Rani, the Rajmata, the Yuvraja and the Yuvrani shall be entitled to all personal privileges enjoyed by them whether within or outside the territories of the State, immediately before the 15th day of August, 1947 ".
agricultural income-tax was, in our judgment, not evinced. Between the dates on which the Act wag enacted and the Adaptation of Laws Order, 1950. several political events of far reaching effect had taken place, in consequence of which the appellant bad ceased to be a Ruler of an Indian State. On January 26, 1950, the date on which the Adaptation of Laws Order, 1950, became operative, there were in, existence no Indian States. The sovereign rights of the erstwhile Rulers of the Indian States were extinguished, and their territories were merged in the, Indian Union. The amendment in the definition of "person " in s. 2, cl. (i), of the Act was made not with) the object of excluding the Rulers of former Indian States from liability to pay tax: it was only made to; delete a clause which, in view of political changes, had no practical significance. Liability to pay tax is imposed by the Act and there is in the Act no express exemption in favour of the appellant. The claim of the appellant to exemption on the ground that he is not a " person " cannot therefore be sustained.	Facts
The appellant contends that as a Ruler of the State of Sonepur, he was, before merger of his State, immune from liability to taxation in respect of his private property both within his territory and outside. He claims that he was so immune in respect of his property within his State as a Ruler and in respect of his property outside the State by the rules of International Law which, he submits, protect from taxation the properties of a Ruler of a State, situate in a foreign State. The appellant says that by Arts. 4 and 5, the Dominion Government guaranteed to him all his personal rights, privileges, dignities and titles enjoyed within or without the territory immediately before the 15th August, 1947, and that any attempt to tax his private property by the State of Orissa or by the Union Government violates that guarantee. The appellant submits that to give effect to this guarantee, all legislation must be interpreted in the light of the merger agreement which he claims is incorporated in Art. 362 of the Constitution and he must be held exempt from liability to pay tax even though no express provision in that behalf has been made by the Legislature. In our view, there is no force in the contentions raised by the appellant. The privileges guaranteed by Arts. 4 and 5 are personal privileges of the appellant as an ex-Ruler and those privileges do not extend to his personal property. In dealing with a similar contention raised on the interpretation of Art. 4 of the merger agreement entered into by the Ruler of Khairagarh (which was in material terms identical with the terms of Art. 4 of the agreement executed by the appellant), S.

The Act imposes on the agricultural income of "every person " liability to pay agricultural income-tax. By the proviso to s. 3, agricultural income of the Central Government, State Government and of local authorities is exempt from tax, but this exemption is not extended to any other body or person. It is true that in the definition of the expression " person " as originally enacted in s. 2, cl. (1), a Ruler of an Indian State was expressly included and by the Adaptation of Laws Order, 1950, reference to Rulers of Indian States was deleted as from January 26, 1950.
