Basdev vs The State Of Pepsu on 17 April, 1956	Case Title
CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 147 of 1955.	Issue
Appeal by special leave from the Judgment and Order dated the 10th May 1955 of the Pepsu High Court at Patiala in Criminal Appeal No. 93 of 1954 arising out of the Judgment and Order dated the 21st June, 1954 of the Court of Sessions Judge at Barnala in Sessions Case No. 18 of 1954. J.N. Kaushal and Naunit Lal, for the appellant. Porus A. Mehta and P. G. Gokhale, for the respondent. 1956. April 17. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.-The appellant Basdev of the village of Harigarh is a retired military Jamadar. He is charged with the murder of a young boy named Maghar Singh, aged about 15 or 16. Both of them and others of the same village went to attend a wedding in another village. All of them went to the house of the bride to take the midday meal on the 12th March, 1954. Some had settled down in their seats and some bad not. The appellant asked Maghar Singh, the young boy to step aside a little so that he may occupy a convenient seat. But Maghar Singh did not move. The appellant whipped out a pistol and shot the boy in the abdomen. The injury proved fatal.	Facts
The party that had assembled for the marriage at the bride's house seems to have made itself very merry and much drinking was indulged in. The appellant Jamadar boozed quite a lot and he became very drunk and intoxicated. The learned Sessions Judge says "he was excessively drunk'? and that "according to the evidence of one witness Wazir Singh Lambardar he was almost in an unconscious condition". This circumstance and the total absence of any motive or premeditation to kill were taken by the Sessions Judge into account and the appellant was awarded the lesser penalty of transportation for life.	PetArg
In a charge of murdering a child levelled against a husband and wife who were both drunk at the time, Patteson J., observed in Regina v. Cruse and Mary his wife (1) "It appears that both these persons were drunk, and although drunkenness is no excuse for any crime whatever, yet it is often of very great importance in cases where it is a question of intention. A person may be so drunk as to be utterly unable to form any intention at all, and yet he may be guilty of very great violence."
Slightly different words but somewhat more illuminating were used by Coleridge J., in Reg. v. Monkhouse(2) "The inquiry as to intent is far less simple than that as to whether an act has been committed, because you cannot look into a man's mind to see what was passing there at any given time. What he intends can only be judged of by what he does or says, and if he says nothing, then his act alone must guide you to your decision. It is a general rule in criminal law, and one founded on common sense, that juries are to presume a man to do what is the natural con sequence of his act. The consequence is sometimes so apparent as to leave no doubt of the intention. A man could not put a pistol which he knew to be loaded to another's bead, and fire it off, without intending to kill him; but even there the state of mind of the party is most material to be considered. For instance, if such an act were done by a born idiot, the intent to kill could not be inferred from the act. Sol if the defendant is proved to have been intoxicated, the question becomes a more subtle one; but it is of the same kind, namely, was he rendered by intoxication entirely incapable of forming the intent charged?"
A great authority on criminal law Stephen J., postulated the proposition in this manner in Beg. v. Doherty(1)-
We may next notice Rex v. Meade(2) where the question was whether there was any misdirection in his summing, up by Lord Coleridge, J. The summing up was in these words:
Darling, J., delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal affirmed the correctness of the summing up but stated the rule in his own words as follows:
Finally, we have to notice the House of Lord's decision in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Beard(1). In this case a prisoner ravished a girl of 13 years of age, and in aid of the act of rape he placed his hand upon her mouth to stop her from screaming, at the same time pressing his thumb upon her throat with the result that she died of suffocation. Drunkenness was pleaded as a defence. Bailhache J. directed the jury that the defence of drunkenness could only prevail if the accused by reason of it did not know what he was doing or did not know that he was doing wrong. The jury brought in a verdict of murder and the man was sentenced to death. The Court of Criminal Appeal (Earl of Reading C.J., Lord Coleridge J., and Sankey, J.) quashed this conviction on the ground of misdirection following Rex v. Meade(2) which established that the presumption that a man intended the natural consequences of his acts might be rebutted in the case of drunkenness by showing that his mind was so affected by the drink that he bad taken that he was incapable of knowing that what he was doing was dangerous. The conviction was, therefore, reduced to manslaughter. The Crown preferred the appeal to the House of Lords and it was heard by a strong Bench consisting of Lord Chancellor, Lord Birkenhead, Earl of Reading, C.J., Viscount Haldane, Lord Denedin, Lord Atkinson, Lord Sumner, Lord Buckmaster, and Lord Phillimore. The Lord Chancellor delivered the judgment of the court. He examined the earlier authorities in a lengthy judgment and reached the conclusion that Rex v. Meade(2) stated the law rather too broadly, though on the facts there proved the decision was right. The position "that a person charged with a crime of violence (1) [1920] A.C. 479.
(2) [1909] 1 K.B. 895.
may show, in order to rebut the presumption that he intended the natural consequences of his acts, that he was so drunk that he was incapable of knowing what he was doing was dangerous.................................. which is what is said in Meade's case, was not correct as a general proposition of law and their Lordships laid down three rules:
The result of the authorities is summarised neatly and compendiously at page 63 of Russel on Crime, tenth edition, in the following words:
In the present case the learned Judges have found that although the accused was under the influence of drink, he was not so much under its influence that his mind was so obscured by the drink that there was incapacity in him to form the required intention as stated. They go on to observe:-	Precedent
An appeal to the PEPSU High Court at Patiala proved unsuccessful. Special leave was granted by this Court limited to the question whether the offence committed by the petitioner fell under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code or section 304 of the Indian Penal Code having regard to the provisions of section 86 of the Indian Penal Code. Section 86 which was elaborately considered by the High Court runs in these terms:

On this finding the offence is not reduced from murder to culpable homicide not amounting to murder under the second part of section 304 of the Indian Penal Code. The conviction and sentence are right and the appeal is dismissed.	Conclusion
CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 147 of 1955.
Appeal by special leave from the Judgment and Order dated the 10th May 1955 of the Pepsu High Court at Patiala in Criminal Appeal No. 93 of 1954 arising out of the Judgment and Order dated the 21st June, 1954 of the Court of Sessions Judge at Barnala in Sessions Case No. 18 of 1954. J.N. Kaushal and Naunit Lal, for the appellant. Porus A. Mehta and P. G. Gokhale, for the respondent. 1956. April 17.

An appeal to the PEPSU High Court at Patiala proved unsuccessful. Special leave was granted by this Court limited to the question whether the offence committed by the petitioner fell under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code or section 304 of the Indian Penal Code having regard to the provisions of section 86 of the Indian Penal Code. Section 86 which was elaborately considered by the High Court runs in these terms:
It is no doubt true that while the first part of the section speaks of intent or knowledge, the latter part deals only with knowledge and a certain element of doubt in interpretation may possibly be felt by reason of this omission. If in voluntary drunkenness knowledge is to be presumed in the same manner as if there was no drunkenness, what about those cases where mens rea is required. Are we at liberty to place in-
tent on the same footing, and if so, why has the section omitted intent in its latter part? This is not the first time that the question comes up for consideration. It has been discussed at length in many decisions and the result may be briefly summarised as follows:-
of weapon; but where a dangerous instrument is used, which, if used, must produce grievous bodily harm, drunkenness can have no effect on the consideration of the malicious intent of the party."
In a charge of murdering a child levelled against a husband and wife who were both drunk at the time, Patteson J., observed in Regina v.
