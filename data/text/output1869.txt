CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeals Nos. 218 to 223 of 1959.
Appeals from the Judgment and Decree dated August 9, 1953, of the Bombay High Court in Appeals Nos. 605 and 606 of 1952 from Original Decrees.	Issue
The plea raised in his plaint by defendant No. 3 that his consent to the reference was obtained by coercion and undue influence is somewhat vague and indefinite. He merely stated that he had recently attained the age of majority, that defendant No. I was the head of the family and that he was not in a position ',either to say anything against him (defendant No. 1) or to act against him." He also stated that defendant No. I had threatened him that he (defendant No. 3) would be given a share only if he acted according to the behest of defendant No. 1 otherwise he would be driven out of the house without anything and therefore he " became helpless " and agreed to sign the " letter of authority passed in favour of the Panchas." He pleaded in para. 5 of the plaint that he had not agreed to take a more fourth share and that he " had all along been insisting upon receiving a half share," and that it was his intention to take his legitimate half share " without dispute if that could be managed " and as he believed that he would be given that share he did not immediately raise any objections He also stated that hill had been promised by defendant No. 1 that he would be given his share in the property. The learned trial judge rejected this plea holding that Defendant No. 3 failed to prove that he was "

No. 221 of 59) and Respondents Nos. 6(a) to 6(c) (In C. A. No. 223 of 59), 1961. February 10. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SHAH, J.-These six appeals are filed with certificates under Art. 133 of the Constitution granted by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay. The appeals arise out of the judgments and decrees in suits Nos. 47 of 1948 and 36 of 1949 in the court of the Civil Judge, Senior Division, Dharwar. The following- geneology set out in the plaint in Suit No. 47 of 1948 explains the relationship between the parties:
This acknowledgment was not merely an agreement not to challenge the decision of the Panchas, but was made as evidencing the division actually made and reduced to writing. The trial court found that the properties separately allotted to the various branches were reduced into possession by the parties and the High Court agreed with that view. If the consent of the parties was not procured by fraud, misrepresentation or any other ground which may vitiate a partition under the general law, the division made by the Panchas and accepted by the parties would be binding upon them. It is always open to the members of a joint Hindu family to divide some properties of the family and to keep the remaining undivided. By the reference to the Panchas, the parties ceased, to be members of the joint Hindu family. If thereafter the assets of the family were divided and that division was accepted by the parties, the properties reduced by the parties to their possession must be deemed to be of the individual ownership of the parties to whom they were allotted, and the remaining properties as of their tenancy- in-common. Evidently in this case, the Panchas suggested what they regarded as a just and -convenient method of partition and that method was accepted by the parties. Originally it was intended to make a general division or award in respect of all the properties and with that end in view a stamp paper of the value of Rs. 30/- was purchased. But in the course of the proceedings, effectuating a division of all the properties by a single award was apparently found inconvenient and a convenient method was adopted and the properties were divided by stages. In the first instance, the principle of division was discussed and decided upon and that principle was accepted by the parties. Thereafter the properties were divided in different sections.
Before the Arbitration Act, 1940, was enacted, an award made by arbitrators appointed out of court even if it was -not made a rule of the court was regarded as equivalent to a final judgment and any suit filed on the original cause of action referred to the arbitrators was held barred. In Muhammad Nawaz Khan v. Alam Khan it was held by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council that an award is valid even if no party has sought to enforce it by the summary procedure, (1) (1891) L.R. 18 I.A. 73.
Since the enactment of the Arbitration Act, 1940,, there has &risen wide divergence of judicial opinion among the High Courts on the question whether an award made in a reference out of court can be set up as a defence to an action filed by a party thereof on, the original cause of action when the award is not filed in court. Section 31, sub-s. (2) of the Arbitration Act provides:
In Babui S. K. Kuer v. B. N. Sinha (1), the Patna High Court held that by virtue of s. 32 of the Arbitration Act, 1940, an award made on a private reference to arbitration is not operative of its own force; it only becomes operative on being made a rule of the court. It was held in that case that an award cannot be set up as a defence to an action unless it is filed in court and a decree is obtained thereon. Similar view was taken in Sait Pamandass v. T. S. Manikyam Pillai Bhimavarapu Venkatasubbauva v. Addanki Bapadu and Firm Gulzarimal Gheesdal v. Firm Rameshrhandra Radhyeshyam (4). On the other hand, in Pamudurthi Suryanarayana Reddy v. Pamudurthi Venkata Reddi (1), it was held that ss. 32 and 33 of the Indian Arbitration Act, 1940, did not preclude a defendant from (1) (1952) l.L.R. 31 Pat. 886.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SHAH, J.-These six appeals are filed with certificates under Art. 133 of the Constitution granted by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay. The appeals arise out of the judgments and decrees in suits Nos. 47 of 1948 and 36 of 1949 in the court of the Civil Judge, Senior Division, Dharwar. The following- geneology set out in the plaint in Suit No. 47 of 1948 explains the relationship between the parties:
were divided by the Panchas in four equal shares. A record thereof was made in the proceedings of the Panchas.
The Panchas then proceeded to award to each of the parties gold ornaments weighing 167 tolas 15 as. and silver 481 tolas and 4 as. On September 24, 1946, it is the case of defendant No. 1 that the Panchas decided to give him an additional share of the value of Rs. 40,000/- out of the property for bringing the family " to the present prosperous conditions " and the Panchas directed that defendant No. 2 should for that purpose pay out of his share Rs. 30,000/- to defendant No. 1 and the plaintiffs should pay Rs. 10,000/- to him and the old house of the joint family be allotted to him as his exclusive property. This was denied by the other parties. On October 12, 1946, the Panchas divided the residential houses and a record of this division was entered in five separate books hereinafter referred to as "partition books." In each of the " partition books the Panchas subscribed their signatures under the record of the division and allotment of the shares and the parties also signed underneath the same in token of acceptance of that division. On October 19, 1946, the Panchas divided an amount of Rs. 64,000/- entries regarding which had been posted in the family books of account. Each party was given Rs. 16,000/- and this division was entered in the account books of Yamosa Dongarsa Kabadi and the entry was duly signed in token of acknowledgment of the correctness by all the parties. It is the case of defendant No. 1 that on that day another amount of Rs. 3,20,000/. which was " the unaccounted cash lying in the safe of the family but which was not entered in the books of account and details whereof were set out in a Tippan Book," was also divided and each party was given Rs. 80,000/-. of the two major contentions in this group of appeals, one has centered round the truth of the story about the division of this amount. 1 On October 20, 1946, the "
This acknowledgment was not merely an agreement not to challenge the decision of the Panchas, but was made as evidencing the division actually made and reduced to writing. The trial court found that the properties separately allotted to the various branches were reduced into possession by the parties and the High Court agreed with that view.

Before the Arbitration Act, 1940, was enacted, an award made by arbitrators appointed out of court even if it was -not made a rule of the court was regarded as equivalent to a final judgment and any suit filed on the original cause of action referred to the arbitrators was held barred. In Muhammad Nawaz Khan v. Alam Khan it was held by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council that an award is valid even if no party has sought to enforce it by the summary procedure, (1) (1891) L.R. 18 I.A. 73.
Since the enactment of the Arbitration Act, 1940,, there has &risen wide divergence of judicial opinion among the High Courts on the question whether an award made in a reference out of court can be set up as a defence to an action filed by a party thereof on, the original cause of action when the award is not filed in court. Section 31, sub-s. (2) of the Arbitration Act provides:
and s. 33 sets out the procedure to be followed for challenging the existence, effect or validity of an arbitration agreement or an award or to have its effect determined. It is manifest that questions relating to the validity, effect or existence of an award can be decided by the court to which an application making it a rule of court lies.
In Babui S. K. Kuer v. B. N. Sinha (1), the Patna High Court held that by virtue of s. 32 of the Arbitration Act, 1940, an award made on a private reference to arbitration is not operative of its own force; it only becomes operative on being made a rule of the court. It was held in that case that an award cannot be set up as a defence to an action unless it is filed in court and a decree is obtained thereon. Similar view was taken in Sait Pamandass v. T. S.

Pamudurthi Venkata Reddi (1), it was held that ss. 32 and 33 of the Indian Arbitration Act, 1940, did not preclude a defendant from (1) (1952) l.L.R. 31 Pat. 886.

setting forth an award which had been fully performed by him but which was not filed in Court under s. 14 and on which a judgment was not pronounced or a decree given under s. 17 of the Act, in answer to the plaintiff's claim which was the subject matter of the reference and the award. That view was accepted in Rajamanickam Pillai v. Swaminatha Pillai (died) (,). It is not necessary in this appeal to express a considered opinion on this disputed question. It may be sufficient to observe that where an award made in arbitration out of court is accepted by the parties and it is acted upon voluntarily and a suit is thereafter sought to be filed by one of the parties ignoring the acts done in pursuance of the acceptance of the award, the defence that the suit is not maintainable is not founded on the plea that there is an award which bars the suit but that the parties have by mutual agreement settled the dispute, and that the agreement and the subsequent actings of the parties are binding. By setting up a defence in the present case that there has been a division of the property and the parties have entered into possession of the properties allotted, defendant No. I is not seeking to obtain a decision upon the existence, effect or validity of an award. He is merely seeking to setup a plea that the property was divided by consent of parties. Such a plea is in our judgment not precluded by anything contained in the Arbitration Act. The records made by the Panchas about the division of the properties, it is true, were not stamped nor were they registered. It is however clear that if the record made by the Panchas in so far as it deals with immoveable properties is regarded as a non-testamentary instrument purporting or operating to create, declare, assign, limit or extinguish any right, title or interest in immoveable property, it was compulsorily registrable under s. 17 of the Registration Act, and would not in the absence of registration be admissible in evidence. But in our judgment, the true effect of what are called awards is not by their own force to create any. interest in immoveable property they recorded (1) A.I.R. 1952 Mad. 24.
divisions already made and on the facts proved in this case, their validity depends upon the acceptance by the parties. The records made by the Panchas were documents which merely acknowledged partitions already made and were not by law required to be registered. On a perusal of Ex. 456A which is a translation of the tippan book in which are recorded the decisions which are signed by the parties, it is evident that the Panchas were merely recording what had been actually divided and they were not seeking to set out their decisions relating to division of property to be made. The question whether the various decisions recorded in Ex. 456A and in the, books of account were required by law to be stamped need not be decided. The documents were admitted in evidence by the trial court and no question of admissibility of those documents can be raised at a later stage of the suit or in appeal (see s. 36, Stamp Act).
We are unable to agree with the view of the High Court that the decisions dated October 12, 1946, October 20,1946, and November 10, 1946, were not intended to be final decisions. There is no reliable evidence to support the view of the High Court. Even if the divisions are not strictly in conformity with the shares declared in the decision dated September 23, 1946, the parties having accepted those divisions and having reduced the shares allotted to their possession, it is not open to them to seek to reopen the same on the ground that the division was unequal. Defendant No. 3 contended in the trial courts and the High Court that he had not taken possession, of the property allotted to his share. The trial court held that he had taken possession of all the properties which had fallen to his share and the plea that he has not obtained possession was untrue. The High Court has accepted that view. To sum up: on a consideration of the materials placed before the court, the reference to Panchas is proved to be made voluntarily by all the parties, that the Panchas had in the first instance decided that each branch was to get a fourth share in the properties and that decision was accepted by the parties, that division of properties made from time to time was also accepted by the parties, and subsequently, when the Panchas were unable to proceed with the division, the matter was referred by consent of the parties to Godkhindi and Godkhindi divided with the consent of the parties the outstandings. but he was unable to divide the remaining properties. For reasons we have already stated, the division made by the Panchas and by Godkhindi is binding upon the parties. Such properties as are not partitioned must of course be ordered to be divided and the division will be made consistently with the rules of Hindu law. To the division of such properties which have not been divided, the decision of the Panchas dated September 23, 1946, will not apply.
We may now turn to the second question whether on October 19, 1946, the amount of Rs. 3,20,000/- which was the "
secret arrangement ", and as the division was " with complete concord ", he did not think it necessary to take a writing or to record it in the books.
The testimony of Huchappa 'was similar. The other Panch Devendrasa stated that plaintiff No. 1 and defendant No. 2 had pressed the Panchas to give them their share in the "
indefinitely postponing " it, that the Panchas advised defendant No. 1 to divide this amount, but he stated that he would be " reduced to equality " with others when' he had a large family and that he had made great efforts and that he should be given more property, otherwise he would not allow division of the " unaccounted cash " and the other property. The Panchas then told him that they had decided upon the share each should be given and no further proposal would be entertained by plaintiff No. 1. The witness then said that he left for Gadag. In cross-examination, he stated that he and the other Panchas had told defendant No.1 to give the shares of the unaccounted cash to the other sharers. The evidence of the witnesses clearly shows that the question relating to the division of the "unaccounted cash "
unacounted cash " in the safe, it was expressly mentioned in the plaint. We would have expected the plaintiffs to state expressly that on or about October 19, 1947, " unaccounted cash " was found in the safe and that even though defendant No. I was asked to divide the same by the remaining parties as well as the Panchas, he declined to accede to that demand. The conduct of defendant No. 3 in not setting out this item in his plaint renders the story that defendant No. I refused to divide this amount somewhat improbable. There is again no reference in the plaint filed by defendant No. 3 that the amount that was divisible was not divided on account of the attitude adopted by defendant No. 1. Counsel for defendant No. 3 relied upon the averments in para. 9 of the plaint that it was not possible for defendant No. 3 to give a description of the remaining properties and the movable articles belonging to the family and the money lending dealings. But there is in the plaint no reference to any cash amount. Schedules appended to the plaint are very detailed and it is difficult to believe that defendant No. 3 did not mention that this amount of Rs. 3,20,000/- was not divided even after demands were made and ignored. The plea that he apprehended that he might be called upon to pay court fee ad valorem on the amount if he specified it in the plaint is futile. Consistently with the 'practice prevailing in the courts in the Bombay Province, defendant No. 3 had paid Rs. 18,12,0 as court fee under Art. 17, cl. VII, on the plea that he and the other parties were in constructive possession of the entire property, belonging to the family. Properties worth lakhs of rupees were described in the schedules annexed to the plaint and if court fee ad valorem was not payable according to defendant No. 3 in respect of, those properties, we fail to appreciate why he should have apprehended that court fee ad valorem would still be payable if he claimed a share -in the cash amount of Rs. 3,20,000/-. There is also the other circumstances that with consent of the parties reference was made to Godkhindi by the three Panchas of all the matters which had remained to be settled, and in the statement made before him which was recorded in writing, there was no reference to the claim that the amount of Rs. 3,20,000/- had remained to be divided. Plaintiff No. 1 gave a detailed statement of the properties which remained to be divided and that document is dated December 5, 1947: Ex. D-482. Item 5 is "
Counsel for the plain. tiffs and the third defendant submitted that the original of this list was in Kannad which was translated into Marathi and the Marathi word which is translated into English as " suspense " was " parabhare ". That word according to the plaintiffs and the third defendant meant " unaccounted for ". It is difficult for us to express any opinion on this argument. It may be observed that the learned Judge of the High Court who delivered the judgment was himself conversant with the Marathi language and he was not prepared to accept that interpretation. But that by itself may not be sufficient to reject the plea of the plaintiffs. What is material is that in a detailed statement consisting of as many as 24 items the plaintiffs have not set out that this amount of Rs. 3,20,000/- which was found in the family safe and which the Panchas wanted to divide, was on account of the uncompromising attitude of the first defendant not divided. If the amount had not been divided, we have not the slightest doubt that in the statement this amount would have been expressly included. Godkhindi was examined as a witness in these suits. The trial court found him to be a person who was wholly disinterested. It appears from the evidence of Godkhindi that no question about the division of Rs. 3,20,000/- was mooted. If the amount had not been divided, we have no doubt that this question would have been prominently brought to his notice; but no such plea was even raised. We are of the view having regard to these circumstances that the amount of Rs. 3,20,000/- must have been divided. In that view of the case, the decree passed by the High Court will be modified as follows:--	Total Judgement
