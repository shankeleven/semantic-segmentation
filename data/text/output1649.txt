The Judgment of the Court was delivered by WANCHOO, J.-These seventy-one appeals on certificates granted by the Judicial Commissioner of Vindhya Pradesh arise out of seventy petitions under art. 226 of the Constitution filed before that Court challenging the constitutionality of the Vindhya Pradesh Abolition of Jagirs and Land Reforms Act, No. XI of 1952, (hereinafter called the Act). They were disposed of by a common judgment by the Judicial Commissioner. We shall also dispose of these appeals, by a common judgment. Seventy (Nos. 40 to 109), out of these appeals, are by the State 'of Vindhya Pradesh (now Madhya Pradesh) while one (No. 110) is by the Brijindar Singh, a jagirdar.	Facts

C. K. Daphtary, Solicitor-General of India, M. Adhikari, Advocate-General for the State of Madhya Pradesh and I. N. Shroff, for the appellant (in C.As. Nos. 40 to 109 of 55) and respondent (in C.A. No. 110/55).
K. B. Asthana, S. N. Andley, J. B. Dadachanji, Rameshwar Nath and P. L. Vohra, for the respondents (in C.As. Nos. 40, 51, 52, 54, 65 and 100155) and appellant (in C.A. No. 110/55).
The case of the petitioners in the Court of the Judicial Commissioner was that the Act was unconstitutional as various provisions in it placed an unreasonable restriction on the exercise of the fundamental rights guaranteed to the petitioners under Part III of the Constitution. The
-Judicial Commissioner held that the Act was constitutional, except for three provisions thereof, namely, S. 22(1), s. 37 and cl. (4) (e) of the Schedule to the Act. The seventy appeals by the 'State are with respect to this part of the order declaring these three provisions unconstitutional. The appeal of Brijindar Singh is against that part of the order by which the rest of the Act was held constitutional. We shall first deal with the appeal of Brijindar singh. Learned counsel for Brijindar Singh was unable-and in our opinion rightly-to challenge the constitutionality of the Act as a whole in view of art. 31-A of the Constitution and the decisions of this court in The State of Bihar v. Maharajadhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh (1), Visweshwar Rao v. The State of Madhya Pradesh (2) Raja Suriya Pal Singh v. The state of U.P. (3), K. C. Gajapati Narayan Deo v.

States of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh Orissa, Rajasthan, Assam, Bombay, Ajmer and Punjab. It is not necessary therefore to examine the provisions of the Act in detail. In the circumstances, Appeal No. 110 is dismissed; but as it was not pressed we think it right that the parties should bear their own costs of this appeal. Now we turn to the appeals by the State. The object of the Act is to resume jagir-lands. Sec. 5 provides for the appointment of a date for the resumption of any class of jagir-land by notification and power is given to the State Government to fix different dates for different classes of jagir-lands. Sec. 6 provides for the consequences of such resumption. Sec. 7, however lays down that notwithstanding anything contained in s. 6, certain lands will remain in possession of jagirdars and cl. (a) thereof is material and may be quoted here-
Sec. 10 and the subsequent sections appearing in Ch. III of the Act provide for compensation and the Schedule provides the manner in which the compensation shall be computed. Then comes Ch. IV, which deals with sir and khudkasht lands. See. 20 provides for an application by the jagirdar for allotment of land for personal cultivation. See. 21 provides for an enquiry by the Tahsildar on such application in the prescribed manner, and the allotment of land and the issue of a patta thereof to the jagirdar having regard to the remaining provisions of the Chapter. Then comes s. 22, which may be quoted in full-
Applying this principle it is obvious that the Vindhya Pradesh legislature in this case had full competence to make this provision under Entry 18, List II of the Seventh Schedule. There is no question here of transgressing those powers and veiling the transgression under a pretence or disguise. We do not think it was proper for the Judicial Commisisioner to (1) [1954] S.C.R. (1) ascribe motives to the legislature as he seems to have done by saying that the provision was made for creating inconvenience to a class whom the legislature did not like. Nor do we think that there is any force in the argument that art. 31-A has no application to provisions dealing with allotment of land, for ss. 7 and 22 of the Act work out the scheme of acquisition of estates and are incidental provisions which are equally protected under that Article along with the main provisions contained in ss. 5 and 6 of the Act; (see Raghubir Singh v. The State of Ajmer (now Rajasthan) (1). The provisions of s. 22 as a whole provide a scheme for carrying out the intention of the legislature expressed in s. 7(a) of the Act and are in our opinion perfectly constitutional.
We now turn to s. 37 of the Act. That section appears in the procedural part of the Act and is as follows:-
Sub-s. (1) thus takes away the jurisdiction of the civil court to decide any matter which under the Act is to be decided by the Tahsildar, the Deputy Commissioner, the Land Reform Commissioner or the Board of Revenue. Sub-s. (2) provides that no order passed by any of these authorities shall be called in question in any court. The learned Judicial Commissioner has held this section invalid on the ground that it.is repugnant to s. 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure, inasmuch as it takes away the jurisdiction of the civil court which it has under that section. Sec. 9 lays down that the civil courts shall have jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature excepting suits of which their cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred. (1) (1959] Suppl (1) C.R. 478 Sec. 9 therefore gives jurisdiction to civil courts to try all suits of a civil nature excepting those which are expressly or impliedly barred by any other law. The provision of s. 37 is an express bar to the matters dealt with in the Act being agitated in civil courts. The learned Judicial Commissioner seems to think that s. 9 takes away the power of the legislature of a Part State like Vindhya Pradesh to legislate with respect to the jurisdiction of courts. The power to the legislature is given by Entry 3, List 11 and cannot be affected by s. 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure. As a matter of fact s. 9 recognises that if a competent legislature passes a law barring the jurisdiction of a civil court, the jurisdiction of the civil court to take cognizance of such suit, even though of a civil nature, is ousted. It was in our opinion unnecessary to go into s. 22 of the Government of Part C States Act, No. XLIX of 1951 and compare it with art. 254 of the Constitution in this connection. Sec. 37 does not in any way affect s. 9. All that it provides is that civil courts shall have no jurisdiction to hear certain matters of a civil nature; and s. 9 expressly recognizes that if such a provision is made by any law, the jurisdiction of the civil courts will disappear. There is thus no question of any repugnancy between s. 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure and s. 37 of the Act. The legislature in this case had power to make a provision like s. 37 and once it did so, the last part of s. 9 will apply and the jurisdiction of the civil courts will become barred by virtue of s. 9 read with s. 37 of the Act. The decision of the Judicial Commissioner there. fore that s. 37 is ultra vires the powers of the Vindhya Pradesh legislature is not correct.
Lastly we come to el. (4) (e) of the Schedule. The Schedule provides for the method of computing compensation. Clause (3) lays down the manner in which the gross income of a jagirdar shall be arrived at. Clause (4) lays down how net income will be arrived at after making certain deductions. One of these deductions is in sub-cl. (e) of this Clause, which is as follows:-	Section
This sub-clause is in fact a contra entry to sub-cl. (b)
(i) of cl. (3). The method of calculation provided by these two clauses is that the gross income is first arrived at without taking into account the land which remains with the jagirdar under s. 7 (a). Thereafter in order to arrive at the net income for the purpose of compensation the rent for sir and khudkasht land which remains with the jagirdar is taken into account and its value determined under el. (3)
(b) (i) minus the revenue payable in respect thereof. This is then deducted from the gross income, for the reason that this land remains, with the jagirdar. The learned Judicial Commissioner thinks that the arithmetical result of this provision is that so far as these lands are concerned the landlord has lost his proprietary interest and has to pay rent to the government, but at the same time gets no compensation. it should however be noted that though the landlord may have to pay rent in future for the land remaining with him, he does not pay any revenue which was payable by him so far with respect to such land. In the circumstances, it cannot be said that he has been deprived of the proprietary interest without any compensation, for he is relieved of the charge of paying land revenue which has also been taken into account in arriving at the net assets for that purpose, and that is all that he can expect considering that the land remains in his possession for all other purposes. We are therefore of opinion that there is nothing unconstitutional in el. (4) (e) of the Schedule. We therefore dismiss Appeal No. 110 but order parties to bear their own costs. We allow Appeals Nos. 40 to 109 and hold that s. 22 (1), s. 37 and cl. (4) (e) of the Schedule are valid and constitutional. As the respondents in these appeals have not seriously contested them we order parties to bear their own costs.
Appeal No. 110 dissmissed.
Appeals Nos. 40 to 109 allowed.	Conclusion
