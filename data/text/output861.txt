CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 213 of 1956. Appeal from the judgment and decree dated Septem. ber 22, 1954, of the Allahabad High Court in Special Appeal No. 8 of 1954 arising out of the judgment and decree dated January 6, 1954 of the said High Court in Civil Miscellaneous Writ Petition No. 651 of 1953.

and also ordered the payment of his wages for the period during which he "remained dismissed". An appeal was taken by the appellant company to the Labour Appellate Tribunal, who by its ,order dated February 24, 1953, affirmed the order of the Tribunal with costs. The appellant company then moved a petition in the Allahabad High Court under Art. 226 of the Constitution but this was dismissed by Bhargava J. on January 6, 1954, and a Special appeal against this judgment was also dismissed. The appellant company has come up in appeal with a certificate under Art. 133 (1) (c) of the Constitution.	Facts
The controversy between the parties arose in the following circumstances:
The use of the word workman in the singular in rr. 4, 5 and 15 forms the basis of the argument for the inclusion of an individual dispute in the expression industrial dispute. But this suffers from more infirmities than one. Rule 4 authorises a workman to (1) 3 Co. Rep. 58: 76 E. R. 764.
I In our opinion therefore rules- 4, 5 and 15 of the Rules cannot be a valid foundation for sustaining the argument raised that an individual dispute was within the definition of 'industrial dispute'. Ordinarily, an award of a tribunal binds or affects the rights of parties to the proceedings but awards of Industrial Tribunals have extended implications and may affect the rights of all workmen of a concern or undertaking end even the future entrants. This doctrine of representation which enlarges the meaning of 'parties' in the U.P. & Central Acts is an essential idea associated with industrial disputes and support-, collectiveness as opposed to individualism. See Latham C. J. in Metal Trades Employers Association v. Amalgamated Engineering Union(1). Then there is the prohibition under r. 26 of the U.P. Act and s. 33 of the Central Act against any change in conditions of service during the pendency of the proceedings the object of which is to ensure discipline and industrial truce during that period which also supports the basic idea of collectiveness in 'industrial disputes'. In Central Provinces Transport Services Ltd. V. Raghunath Gopal Patwardhan (2), this Court observed that decided cases in India disclose three views as to the meaning of 'industrial dispute'
(i) a dispute between an employer and a single workman cannot be an 'industrial dispute';
(ii) it can be an industrial dispute; and
This Court discussed the scope of industrial dispute as defined in s. 2(k), of the Central Act, and after referring to the conflict of judicial opinion as to its applicability to the case of a dispute between an employer and a single workman further observed:
According to English decisions an individual dispute of a workman is not included in 'trade dispute' which corresponds to 'Industrial Dispute' in the Indian Act. In the English Trade Disputes Act of 1906 and 1919 as also in Reg. 58-AA of the Defence (General) Regulation, 1939, 'trade dispute' was defined in language very similar to 'industrial dispute' in the Indian Statute. Dealing with a trade dispute, Lord Shaw in Conway v, Wade (2) said,:
necessarily includes accordingly every case of person al difference between any one workman and one or more of his fellows. It is true that after a, certain stage even such a dispute, although originally grounded, (1) [1953] S.C.R. 302, 310.
(2) [1909] A.C, 596, 520.
it may be, upon personal animosity, may come to be a subject in which sides are taken, and may develop into a situation of a general aspect containing the characteristics of a trade dispute; but until it reaches that stage I cannot hold that a trade dispute necessarily exists." Lord Wright observed in National Association of Local Government Officers v. Bolton Corporation (1) " I think the same may be said of the Industrial Courts Act and of reg. 58-AA, in both of which the word 'trade' is used in the very wide connotation which it bears in the modem legislation dealing with conditions of employment, particularly in relation to matters of collective bargaining and the like.."
Ex parte Keable Press Ltd.(2) was an instance of an individual dispute developing into a 'trade dispute' because. of the strike by a union to enforce the rein- statement of dismissed workman. That was how this term (trade dispute) was interpreted by the Court of Appeal in R. v. National Arbitration Tribunal(3) after taking into consideration the definition of the word 'dispute'. In Australian cases also, without specific reference to any definition of the phrase the courts have excluded individual disputes from the scope of industrial disputes. In Jumbunna Coal Mine v. Victorian Coal Miners Association (4), Griffths C.J. observed:
Similarly in Federated Saw Mills & Co. Employees of Australasia v. James Moore & Son Proprietory Ltd. (5), Griffths C.J. gave the characteristics of an industrial dispute as follows:
connotes a, real and substantial difference having some element of persistency, and likely, if not adjusted, to endanger the industrial peace of the community". Vide Federated Saw Mills Case(2) at p. 488. The same meaning was attached to the expression by Latham C.J. in Metal Traders Employers Association v. Amwlgamated Engineering Union(3) at p. 403:
individual workman if taken up by the worker's union makes such a dispute an industrial dispute. In that case 1 1 items of difference were referred to the Industrial Tribunal., One of the items in dispute was the wrongful removal of a workman, Sundaram by name. In the', High Court an objection was taken to the legality of the award on the ground that no industrial dispute existed and that there was no material before the Government on the basis of which it could make a reference. It was held that the dispute as to a single workman was not an industrial dispute. Kandan Textile Ltd. case (1) was followed in United Commercial Bank, Ltd. v. The Commissioner of Labour, Madras (2) which was a case under s. 41 of the Madras Shops and Establishments Act and the right of appeal given to an individual employee against the order of the employer dispensing with his services under s. 41(2) of Madras Shops and Establishments Act was challenged on the ground that it had been taken away by the Central Act. It was held that an individual worker had the right to appeal. Vishwanatha Sastri J. in his judgment referred with approval to the distinction made between an individual dispute and an industrial dispute in Kandan Textile Ltd. v. Industrial Tribunal, Madras (supra).
The second view that such a dispute falls within the definition of the word "industrial dispute" is supported by a decision of a Full Bench of the Labour Appellate Tribunal- Swadeshi Cotton Mills Co. Ltd. v. Their Workmen (3) There the question was mainly decided on the- basis of s. 33-A of the Central Act (introduced in 1950) which gives the right to an individual workman dismissed or dealt with contrary to s. 33 of the Act during an industrial dispute to raise the matter before a tribunal. The introduction of s. 33-A would not alter the construction to be placed on the phrase 'industrial dispute'. On the contrary it supports the view that an individual dispute is not comprised in that phrase. In view of what has been said above, we are of the opinion that in so far as that case lay& down (3) [1953] 1 L.L.J. 757.
that a dispute raised by an individual workman as to his personal grievance is within an industrial dispute, it cannot be said to have been correctly decided. The cases which support the third view are the following:
'(6) [1956] 2 L.L.J. 89, Taking into consideration the whole tenor of the Act and the decisions of this Court the decided cases to the extent that they take a contrary view, i.e., an individual dispute is comprised in an 'industrial dispute' must unless there is something peculiar- as to facts, be In spite of the fact that the making of a reference by the Government under the Industrial Disputes Act is the exercise of its administrative powers, that is not destructive of the rights of an aggrieved party to show that what was referred was not an 'industrial dispute' at all and therefore the jurisdiction of the Industrial Tribunal to make the award can be questioned, even though the factual existence of a dispute may not be subject to a party's challenge. State of Madras v. C. P. Sarathy (1), It may also be noted that the notification issued by the U. P. Government on January 3, 1953, already quoted proceeds on the assumption that a dispute exists between the "employer and his workmen". The points of dispute in the reference, however, comprise the wrongful termination of the service of only Tajammul Hussain, a lino operator. The words used in the first part of the notification show that the Government was labouring under the misapprehension that this dispute was between the employer on the one hand and his workmen on the other, which, in fact it was not. Tajammul Hussain could not be termed work-, men (in the plural) nor could the U. P. Working Journalists Union be called "his workmen" nor is there any indication that the individual dispute had got transformed into an industrial dispute. The very basis, therefore, of the reference was bad and must be held to be so.	Precedent
1957. March 20. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR J.-The ground on which the appellant company seeks to have the order of the Industrial Tribunal set aside is that no industrial 'dispute existed within the meaning of the expression as used in the U.P. Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (XXVIII of 1947) (hereinafter called the U.P. Act) and consequently the U.P. Government had no power to make the reference in question. I Industrial Dispute' is defined in s. 2 of the U.P. Act as having the same meaning assigned to it as in s. 2 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (here- inafter termed the Central Act). There this expression has been defined in s. 2 (k) to mean :
The controversy which arises in this case is whether a dispute between an employer and a single workman falls within the definition of I industrial dispute' as used in the U.P. Act. In order to resolve this controversy, it is necessary to refer to the scheme of the U.P. Act and the relevant rules made thereunder. The preamble of the Act runs: " to provide for powers to prevent strikes and look- outs, and for the settlement of industrial disputes and other incidental matters ". Section 3 of the Act confers certain powers on the State Government for the purpose of prevention of strikes, lock-outs, etc.- The portion of this section relevant for the purpose of this appeal reads as follows:
Rule 5 deals with proceedings and the power of inclusion of other undertakings. The proviso to this rule is:
Rules 7 to 11-A deal with Industrial Tribunals. Rule 10 gives power to the Government to make a reference of any dispute to the Industrial Tribunal either on its own motion or after considering the Report of the Conciliation Board made under r. 6.
Rule 15(1) which deals with the representation of parties to the dispute provides:
The language of section 36(1) of the Central Act is almost identical.
Rule 27 prohibits strikes and look-outs; and r. 28 gives finality and conclusiveness to the orders made or directions given.
The use of the word 'workmen' in the plural in the definition of industrial dispute' does not by itself exclude the applicability of the Act to an individual dispute because under a. 13(2) of the General Clauses Act subject.............
(2) words in the singular shall include the plural and vice versa,"
So construed the provisions of the U.P. Act show that the machinery of the Act has been devised with the object of maintaining industrial peace so as to prevent interference with public safety or public order or with the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the life of the community or of employment. The Act is based on the necessity of achieving collective amity between labour and capital by means of conciliation, mediation and adjudication. The object of the Act is the prevention of industrial strife, strikes and lock-outs and the promotion of industrial peace and not to take the place of the ordinary tribunals of the land for the enforcement of contracts between an employer and an individual workman. Thus viewed the provisions of the Act lead to the conclusion that its applicability to an individual dispute as opposed to dispute involving a group of workmen is excluded unless it acquires the general characteristics of an industrial dispute, viz., the workmen as a body or a considerable section of them make common cause with the individual workman and thus create conditions contemplated by s. 3 of the U.P. Act which is the foundation of State Governmental action under that Act. The other provisions which follow that section only subserve the carrying out of the objects of the Acts specified therein.
apply to a Conciliation Officer for the settlement of an industrial dispute. The meaning sought to be given to this word is inconsistent with the language of the latter part of that rule;
or where no registered trade union of workmen exists in any concern or industry, the representatives not more than 5 in number of the workmen............ duly elected." The first proviso to r. 5 is no surer foundation for the argument because in the context it can only be interpreted to mean that, should there be an industrial dispute then all workmen who may individually be the cause of the dispute or are to be affected by its decision should get notices of the proceedings. Similarly, r. 15 only provides for the representation of " a workman " even if he is only one by an officer of a trade union or other person mentioned in the rule. Besides, s. 13(2) of the General Clauses Act as to the interpretation of the singular and the plural consider- ably reduces the efficacy of the argument, which altogether loses its force in view of r. 26 which is as follows :
The use of the words " workmen" and " workman in the above rule is indicative of the intention of the Act being applicable to collective disputes and not to individual ones, and this is fortified by the finality and the binding effect to awards by r. 28 and more speciall.v by a. 18 of the Central Act which makes awards binding not only on the individuals present or represented but on all the workmen employed in the establishment and even on future entrants. Another objection to reading these rules in the manner above suggested is that it would be tantamount to enlarging the scope of the expression 'industrial dispute' and the powers conferred on the State Government under s. 3 of the U. P. Act. The executive cannot under the power of framing rules and regulations clothe itself with powers which the Statute itself does not give and which are inconsistent with the interpretation put on the expression 'industrial dispute'. The cardinal rule in regard to promulgation of bye-laws or making rules is that they must be legi fidei rationi consona, and therefore all regulations which are contrary or repugnant to statutes under which they are made are ineffective. If the expression I industrial dispute' as ordinarily understood and, construed conveys a dispute between an employer on the one hand and the workmen acting collectively on the other, then the definition of those words cannot be widened by a statutory rule or regulation promulgated under the Statute or by Executive fiat. I The notification in the present case was under s. 3(c),
(d) and (g) and under s. 8 which deal with (c) the appointment of industrial Courts, (d) referring any industrial disputes and (g) incidental or supplementary matters. The Executive may in the exercise of these powers make such regulations which are necessary but under that garb it cannot extend the definition of the term industrial disputes, nor is this extended meaning necessary to subserve the objects of the Act.

We would, therefore, allow this appeal with costs. Appeal allowed.

CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 213 of 1956.

1957. March 20. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR J.-The ground on which the appellant company seeks to have the order of the Industrial Tribunal set aside is that no industrial 'dispute existed within the meaning of the expression as used in the U.P.

This doctrine of representation which enlarges the meaning of 'parties' in the U.P. & Central Acts is an essential idea associated with industrial disputes and support-, collectiveness as opposed to individualism. See Latham C. J. in Metal Trades Employers Association v. Amalgamated Engineering Union(1). Then there is the prohibition under r. 26 of the U.P. Act and s. 33 of the Central Act against any change in conditions of service during the pendency of the proceedings the object of which is to ensure discipline and industrial truce during that period which also supports the basic idea of collectiveness in 'industrial disputes'. In Central Provinces Transport Services Ltd. V. Raghunath Gopal Patwardhan (2), this Court observed that decided cases in India disclose three views as to the meaning of 'industrial dispute'
(i) a dispute between an employer and a single workman cannot be an 'industrial dispute';
(ii) it can be an industrial dispute; and
(iii) it can not per se be an industrial dispute but may become one if taken up by a trade union or a number of workmen.
This Court discussed the scope of industrial dispute as defined in s. 2(k), of the Central Act, and after referring to the conflict of judicial opinion as to its applicability to the case of a dispute between an employer and a single workman further observed:
Although the question did not directly arise, this Court in D . N. Banerji v. P. R. Mukherjee and others(1) discussed the meaning of the expression 'industrial dispute' and was of the opinion that it "conveys the meaning to the ordinary mind that the dispute must be such as would affect large groups of workmen and employers ranged on opposite sides...... But at the same time, having regard to the modern conditions of society where capital an labour have organised themselves into groups for the purpose of fighting their disputes and settling them on the basis of the theory that in union is strength, and collective bargaining has come to stay, a single employee's. case might develop into an industrial dispute, when as often happens, it is taken up by the trade union of which he is a member and there is a concerted demand by the employees for redress". This view is in consonance with the basic idea underlying modern industrial legislation. The interpretation given to the corresponding phrase "trade dispute" in English law and "industrial dispute" in Australian Law also accords with this view and in the absence of an express provision to the contrary or necessary intendment there is no reason to give a different interpretation to the expression in the Indian Statute.
According to English decisions an individual dispute of a workman is not included in 'trade dispute' which corresponds to 'Industrial Dispute' in the Indian Act. In the English Trade Disputes Act of 1906 and 1919 as also in Reg. 58-AA of the Defence (General) Regulation, 1939, 'trade dispute' was defined in language very similar to 'industrial dispute' in the Indian Statute. Dealing with a trade dispute, Lord Shaw in Conway v, Wade (2) said,:
necessarily includes accordingly every case of person al difference between any one workman and one or more of his fellows. It is true that after a, certain stage even such a dispute, although originally grounded, (1) [1953] S.C.R. 302, 310.
(2) [1909] A.C, 596, 520.
it may be, upon personal animosity, may come to be a subject in which sides are taken, and may develop into a situation of a general aspect containing the characteristics of a trade dispute; but until it reaches that stage I cannot hold that a trade dispute necessarily exists." Lord Wright observed in National Association of Local Government Officers v. Bolton Corporation (1) " I think the same may be said of the Industrial Courts Act and of reg. 58-AA, in both of which the word 'trade' is used in the very wide connotation which it bears in the modem legislation dealing with conditions of employment, particularly in relation to matters of collective bargaining and the like.."
Ex parte Keable Press Ltd.(2) was an instance of an individual dispute developing into a 'trade dispute' because. of the strike by a union to enforce the rein- statement of dismissed workman. That was how this term (trade dispute) was interpreted by the Court of Appeal in R. v. National Arbitration Tribunal(3) after taking into consideration the definition of the word 'dispute'. In Australian cases also, without specific reference to any definition of the phrase the courts have excluded individual disputes from the scope of industrial disputes. In Jumbunna Coal Mine v. Victorian Coal Miners Association (4), Griffths C.J. observed:
Similarly in Federated Saw Mills & Co. Employees of Australasia v. James Moore & Son Proprietory Ltd. (5), Griffths C.J. gave the characteristics of an industrial dispute as follows:
in 1900 to the, minds of persons conversant with the English language.....................
connotes a, real and substantial difference having some element of persistency, and likely, if not adjusted, to endanger the industrial peace of the community". Vide Federated Saw Mills Case(2) at p. 488. The same meaning was attached to the expression by Latham C.J. in Metal Traders Employers Association v. Amwlgamated Engineering Union(3) at p. 403:
individual workman if taken up by the worker's union makes such a dispute an industrial dispute. In that case 1 1 items of difference were referred to the Industrial Tribunal., One of the items in dispute was the wrongful removal of a workman, Sundaram by name. In the', High Court an objection was taken to the legality of the award on the ground that no industrial dispute existed and that there was no material before the Government on the basis of which it could make a reference. It was held that the dispute as to a single workman was not an industrial dispute. Kandan Textile Ltd. case (1) was followed in United Commercial Bank, Ltd. v. The Commissioner of Labour, Madras (2) which was a case under s. 41 of the Madras Shops and Establishments Act and the right of appeal given to an individual employee against the order of the employer dispensing with his services under s. 41(2) of Madras Shops and Establishments Act was challenged on the ground that it had been taken away by the Central Act. It was held that an individual worker had the right to appeal. Vishwanatha Sastri J. in his judgment referred with approval to the distinction made between an individual dispute and an industrial dispute in Kandan Textile Ltd. v. Industrial Tribunal, Madras (supra).
The second view that such a dispute falls within the definition of the word "industrial dispute" is supported by a decision of a Full Bench of the Labour Appellate Tribunal- Swadeshi Cotton Mills Co. Ltd. v. Their Workmen (3) There the question was mainly decided on the- basis of s. 33-A of the Central Act (introduced in 1950) which gives the right to an individual workman dismissed or dealt with contrary to s. 33 of the Act during an industrial dispute to raise the matter before a tribunal. The introduction of s. 33-A would not alter the construction to be placed on the phrase 'industrial dispute'. On the contrary it supports the view that an individual dispute is not comprised in that phrase. In view of what has been said above, we are of the opinion that in so far as that case lay& down (3) [1953] 1 L.L.J. 757.
that a dispute raised by an individual workman as to his personal grievance is within an industrial dispute, it cannot be said to have been correctly decided. The cases which support the third view are the following:
'(6) [1956] 2 L.L.J. 89, Taking into consideration the whole tenor of the Act and the decisions of this Court the decided cases to the extent that they take a contrary view, i.e., an individual dispute is comprised in an 'industrial dispute' must unless there is something peculiar- as to facts, be In spite of the fact that the making of a reference by the Government under the Industrial Disputes Act is the exercise of its administrative powers, that is not destructive of the rights of an aggrieved party to show that what was referred was not an 'industrial dispute' at all and therefore the jurisdiction of the Industrial Tribunal to make the award can be questioned, even though the factual existence of a dispute may not be subject to a party's challenge. State of Madras v. C. P. Sarathy (1), It may also be noted that the notification issued by the U. P. Government on January 3, 1953, already quoted proceeds on the assumption that a dispute exists between the "employer and his workmen". The points of dispute in the reference, however, comprise the wrongful termination of the service of only Tajammul Hussain, a lino operator. The words used in the first part of the notification show that the Government was labouring under the misapprehension that this dispute was between the employer on the one hand and his workmen on the other, which, in fact it was not. Tajammul Hussain could not be termed work-, men (in the plural) nor could the U. P. Working Journalists Union be called "his workmen" nor is there any indication that the individual dispute had got transformed into an industrial dispute. The very basis, therefore, of the reference was bad and must be held to be so.
We would, therefore, allow this appeal with costs. Appeal allowed.
