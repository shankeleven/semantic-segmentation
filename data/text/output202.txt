1952. February 25. The Judgment of the court was deliv- ered by FAZL ALI J.--This is an appeal by special leave against the judgment of the Punjab High Court upholding the decision of a Subordinate Judge of Delhi relating to a petition filed by the appellant-company under section 33 of the Indian Arbitration Act against the respondents, The material facts are these. On the 22nd April, 1947, the appellant company insured a car belonging to the first respondent and issued a policy which fully sets out the terms and conditions of the agreement relating to the insur- ance. The first respondent left his car in a garage at Lahore and came away to India on the 31st July, 1947. Subsequently, he learned about the loss of his car, and sent a legal notice dated the 18th March, 1948, through his advocate Mr. A.R. Kapur to the Head Office of the company at Calcutta, claiming a sum of Rs. 7,000 for the loss of the car. On the 10th April, 1948, Mr. Kapur received a letter from the Branch Manager of the Company's office at Amrit- sar asking for information regarding certain matters stated in the letter. This information appears to have been sup- plied on the 30th April, 1948. On the 26th May, 1948, the company's Branch Manager at Amritsar wrote to the first respondent repudiating the liability of the company for the loss of the car on the ground that the loss was "due to communal riots which were going on in the whole of Punjab"
Upon this petition, notice was issued to the respond- ents, and an injunction was issued directing them not to file any award till the date of the next hearing, which was fixed for 31st January, 1950. On the 4th February, 1930, the first respondent wrote to the second respondent (the arbitrator) that since no arbitrator had been appointed by the company and since the company had refused to appoint any arbitrator, he (Mr. Chopra) was to act as the sole arbitra- tor. On the 6th February, 1950, Mr. Chopra wrote to inform the insurance company that he had been appointed sole arbi- trator and asked the company to send the statement of its case and to produce all the evidence on the 14th February, 1950. On the 10th February, 1950, the insurance company filed a petition before the Subordinate Judge, Delhi, pray- ing that the respondents be stopped from proceeding further in the matter so that its application under section 33 may not become infructuous. On the 11th February, the Subordi- nate Judge issued notice to the respondents fixing the 17th February as the date of hearing and passed the following order:
On the 24th March, 1950, the Subordinate Judge passed an order on the company's application under section 33, dis- missing it and holding that the terms of clause 7 of the agreement "were comprehensive enough to include the points of disputes between the parties now and as such are triable by the arbitrator and not by the court." The Subordinate Judge concluded his order by observing:	Facts
The judgment of the Subordinate Judge was upheld in revision by the Punjab High Court and the company has now preferred an appeal to this court by special leave. The points that were urged on behalf of the appellant in this appeal are these: --	PetArg
Som Nath Chopra for the respondent.
The main contention put forward on behalf of the appel- lant is that the points in dispute fall outside the juris- diction of the arbitrator, firstly because the existence of the arbitration agreement is challenged, and secondly, because the sole object of the application under section 33 of the Arbitration Act is tO have the effect of the arbitration agreement determined. In our opinion, neither of these objections is sound. How can it be held that the existence of the arbitration agreement is challenged, when both parties admit that the clause in the policy which contains that agreement binds them. It is neither party's case that there is no arbitration agreement in the policy. On the ,:other hand, both parties admit that such agreement exists, and each of them relies on it to support its case. It is true that the appellant contends that the arbitration agreement has ceased to be applicable, but that contention cannot be sustained without having recourse to the arbitration agreement. It is said that the agreement no longer subsists,but that is very different from saying that the agreement never existed or was void ab initio and therefore is to be treated as non-existent. Again, no question of determining the effect of the arbitration agreement arises, because there is no dispute between the parties as to what it means. The language of the arbitration clause is quite clear, and both,parties construe it in the same way. The real question between them is whether the first respondent has or has not complied with the conditions of the agreement. But this question does not turn on the effect of the agreement. This is the view which has substantially been taken by the High Court, and in our opinion it is correct.
The second point urged before us is that the award is invalid, since it was made in spite of the court's injunc- tion directing the arbitrator not to pronounce any award. This point however does not, in our opinion, fall within the scope of this appeal. The application under section 33 of the Arbitration Act, which is the subject of this appeal, was filed before the award was pronounced. In that applica- tion, there is no reference to the award; nor is there any reference to the circumstances which are now stated to invalidate the award and which happened after the applica- tion was filed. The learned counsel for the appellant made an application before us praying for the amendment of the petition under section 38 by introducing certain additional facts and adding a prayer for declaring the award to be invalid, but it was rejected/by us. It should be stated that as early as the 24th March, 1950, the Subordi- nate Judge in dismissing the appellant's petition under section 33, made the following observations :--	RespArg
He made a further note at the end of the award to this effect :--
In Macaura v. Northern Assurance Co. (1), the appellant had insured a large quantity of timber against fire and the greater part of the timber having been de- stroyed by fire, he sued the insurance company to recover the loss but the action was stayed and the matter was re- ferred to arbitration in pursuance of the conditions con- tained in the policy. The arbitrator held that the claimant had no insurable interest in the goods insured and disal- lowed the claim. One of the points raised in the case was that the arbitrator had no jurisdiction to decide the mat- ter, but that contention was rejected by Lord Sumner in these words:-
In Stebbing v. Liverpool and London and Globe Insurance Company Limited(2), to which reference was made by Lord Summer, the policy of insurance contained a clause referring to the decision of an arbitrator "all differences arising out of this policy ". It also (1) [1925] A.C. 619. (3) [1919] 1 K.B. 593, (2) [1917] 2 K.B. 433, contained a recital that the assured had made a proposal and declaration as the basis of the contract, and a clause to the effect that compliance with the conditions indorsed upon the policy should be a condition precedent to any liability on the part of the insurers. One of the conditions provided that if any false declaration should be made or used in support of a claim all benefit under the policy should be forfeited. In answer to a claim by the assured, the insurers alleged that statements in the proposal and declaration were false. When the matter came before the arbitrator, the assured objected that this was not a difference in the arbitration and that the arbitrator had no power to deter- mine whether the answers were true or not, or to determine any matters which called in question the validity of the policy. In holding that the arbitrator had jurisdiction to decide the matter, Viscount Reading C.J. observed as fol- lows:-	Precedent
ent No. 2 from making any award.
Clause 7 of the policy of insurance rims as follows :---	Section
In our opinion, the Subordinate Judge correctly indi- cated the course which it was open to the appellant in law to adopt for the purpose of questioning the validity of the award, but not having taken that course and not having made any application in the courts below for amending the petition under section 33, the company cannot ask this court to go into the validity of the award by widening the scope of the original petition. This court is always in favour of shortening litigation, but it would be a very unusual step to allow the petition under section 33 to be amended now and to decide a question involving investigation of facts with- out having the benefit of the judgments of the courts below. In the result, the appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.

1952. February 25. The Judgment of the court was deliv- ered by FAZL ALI J.--This is an appeal by special leave against the judgment of the Punjab High Court upholding the decision of a Subordinate Judge of Delhi relating to a petition filed by the appellant-company under section 33 of the Indian Arbitration Act against the respondents, The material facts are these.

ent No. 2 from making any award.
Upon this petition, notice was issued to the respond- ents, and an injunction was issued directing them not to file any award till the date of the next hearing, which was fixed for 31st January, 1950. On the 4th February, 1930, the first respondent wrote to the second respondent (the arbitrator) that since no arbitrator had been appointed by the company and since the company had refused to appoint any arbitrator, he (Mr. Chopra) was to act as the sole arbitra- tor.

On the 10th February, 1950, the insurance company filed a petition before the Subordinate Judge, Delhi, pray- ing that the respondents be stopped from proceeding further in the matter so that its application under section 33 may not become infructuous. On the 11th February, the Subordi- nate Judge issued notice to the respondents fixing the 17th February as the date of hearing and passed the following order:
On the 14th February, 1950, the second respondent pronounced his award after making a note to the following effect:-
He made a further note at the end of the award to this effect :--
On the 24th March, 1950, the Subordinate Judge passed an order on the company's application under section 33, dis- missing it and holding that the terms of clause 7 of the agreement "were comprehensive enough to include the points of disputes between the parties now and as such are triable by the arbitrator and not by the court." The Subordinate Judge concluded his order by observing:
The judgment of the Subordinate Judge was upheld in revision by the Punjab High Court and the company has now preferred an appeal to this court by special leave. The points that were urged on behalf of the appellant in this appeal are these: --
tive and the question as to the existence and validity of the arbitration agreement was triable by the court under section 33 of the Arbitration Act and not by the arbitrator; and (2) that the award was invalid and not binding on the appellant, because it was pronounced in spite of the order of the court dated the 11th February, 1950, directing the arbitrator not to pronounce his award.
Clause 7 of the policy of insurance rims as follows :---
It will be noticed that this clause provides among other things that if the company disclaimed liability to the insured for any claim under the policy and such claim was not within twelve calender months from the date of such disclaimer referred to arbitration, then the claim should be deemed to have been abandoned and was not recoverable. The case of the company is that it disclaimed liability for the loss of the car on three successive occasions, namely, on the 26th May, 1948, the 3rd July, 1948, and the 1st August, 1948. The first respondent however did not take any action in regard to the appointment of an arbitrator until the 21st November, 1949, i.e, until more than 12 months after even the last disclaimer by the company. For this reason, the claim put forward by the first respondent must be deemed to have been abandoned and he cannot recover anything from the company. On the other hand. the case of the first respond- ent, which is set out in. his affidavit dated the 17th February, 1950, is that there was never any valid disclaimer by the company of its liability. The position that he took up was that the Branch Manager of the company had no authority to disclaim the liability, and it could have been disclaimed only by a resolution of the company. Now these being the respective contentions of the parties, the question is whether the point in dispute fell to be decided by the arbitrator or by the court under section 33 of the Arbitration Act. Section 33 is to the following effect:--
The question to be decided is whether the point on which the parties are in dispute is a difference "arising out of the policy" in terms of clause 7 of the policy. The test for determining such a question has been laid down in a series of cases and is a simple one. The test is whether recourse to the contract by which the parties are bound is necessary for the purpose of determining the matter in dispute between them. If such recourse to the contract is necessary. then the matter must come within the scope of the arbitrator's jurisdiction. In the present case, both the parties admit the contract and state that they are bound by it. Indeed, the appellant-company, in order to make good its contention, is obliged to rely and does rely on that part of clause 7 of the policy which states that if the company should disclaim liability and the claim be not referred to arbitration within 12 months of such disclaimer, the claim shall be deemed to have been abandoned. Evidently, the company cannot succeed without calling in aid this clause and relying on it. Again, the first respondent does not say that he is not bound by the clause but states that the matter was referred to arbitration before any valid disclaimer was made. The position therefore is that one party relying upon the arbitration clause says that there has been a breach of its terms and the other party, also relying on that clause, says that there has been no breach but on the other hand the requirements of that clause have been fulfilled. Thus, the point in dispute between the parties is one for the decision of which the appellant is compelled to invoke to his aid one of the terms of the insurance agreement. It is thus clear that the difference between the parties is a difference arising out of the policy and the arbitrator had jurisdic- tion to decide it, the parties having made him the sole judge of all differences arising out of the policy. A large number of cases were cited before us on behalf of the parties, but it is unnecessary to refer to them, since the question which arises in this appeal is a simple one and is covered by the statement of law which is to be found in the decision of this Court in A.M. Mair & Co. v. Gordhandass Sagarmull C), and in a series of English author- ities, some of which only may be referred to. In Heyman v. Darwins, Ltd. (2) the law on the subject has been very clearly stated in the following passage :-
If. however, the parties are at one in asserting that they entered into a binding contract, but a difference has arisen between them as to whether there has been a breach by one side or the other, or as to whether circumstances have arisen which have discharged one or both parties from fur- ther performance, such differences should be regarded as differences which have arisen 'in respect of,' or 'with regard to,' or 'under' the contract, and an arbitration clause which uses these, or similar expressions, should be construed accordingly."
In Macaura v. Northern Assurance Co. (1), the appellant had insured a large quantity of timber against fire and the greater part of the timber having been de- stroyed by fire, he sued the insurance company to recover the loss but the action was stayed and the matter was re- ferred to arbitration in pursuance of the conditions con- tained in the policy. The arbitrator held that the claimant had no insurable interest in the goods insured and disal- lowed the claim. One of the points raised in the case was that the arbitrator had no jurisdiction to decide the mat- ter, but that contention was rejected by Lord Sumner in these words:-
