Appeal from the judgment and order dated August 31, 1954, of the Calcutta High Court in Income-tax Ref. No. 57 of 1953. N. C. Chatterjee and B. P. Maheshwari, for the appellant. K. N. Rajagopala Sastri, R. H. Dhebar and D. Gupta, for the respondent.	Issue
1959. March 26. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by HIDAYATULLAH, J.-Messrs. Howrah Trading Company, Ltd., Calcutta (hereinafter called the assessee) obtained on April 28, 1955, a certificate under s. 66A(2) of the Indian Income-tax Act from the Calcutta High Court, to appeal to this Court against the judgment dated August 31, 1954, in Income-tax Reference No. 57 of 1953. The Divisional Bench (Chakravarti, C. J., and Lahiri, J.) in the judgment under appeal merely followed their earlier judgment delivered the same day in Income-tax Reference No. 22 of 1953, since reported as Hindustan Investment Corporation v. Commissioner of Income-tax (1). It is the latter judgment which gives the reasons for the decision.
The facts of the case have been stated with sufficient fulness, yet briefly, in the statement of the case submitted by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal (Calcutta Bench) and may be conveniently set out in its own words:	Facts
The assessee contends that the decision of the High Court is erroneous, and that it is entitled to have the dividend income I grossed up' under s. 16(2) and also to claim credit for tax deducted at source, under s.18(5) of the Income-tax Act.
Learned counsel for the assessee cited a number of authorities in which the ownership of the dividend was in question, and it was held that the transferee whose name was not registered, was entitled to the dividend after transfer had been made. These cases are Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Sir John Oakley (6), Spence v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue (7) (1) [1948] 16 I.T.R. 187.	PetArg
The Income-tax Officer did not accept this claim, and the appeals of the assessee were rejected by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner of Income-tax, Calcutta, " A " Range and by the Appellate Tribunal. The Tribunal, however, on being moved, referred the following question to the High Court:
The High Court answered the question in the negative, thus affirming the decisions of the Department and the Appellate Tribunal.
When the company pays its own income-tax and declares a dividend from the balance of its profits, it deducts from such dividend a proportionate part of the amount of the tax paid by it. This principle is explained in another English case, and it is substantially also the law in this country. In Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Blott (2), Viscount Cave stated the law in these words:
A glance at the scheme of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, shows that the words " member ", " shareholder " and "
share " as " share in the share capital of the company Section 5 deals with the mode of forming incorporated companies, and in the case of companies limited by shares, the liability of the members is limited to the amounts, if any, unpaid on the shares respectively held by them. By s. 18, Table A is made applicable to companies, unless by the Articles of any company the terms of Table A have been excluded or modified. Regulation 18 of Table A reads as follows:
The words " holder of a share " are really equal to the word shareholder and the expression " holder of a share denotes, in so far as the company is concerned, only a person who, as a shareholder, has his name entered on the register of members. A similar view of the Companies Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, was taken in Nanney v. Morgan(1). The learned Lord Justices held that under s. 15 of that Act, the transferee bad not the benefit of a legal title till certain things were done, which were indicated by Lopes, L.J., in the following passage:
The same position obtains in India, though the completion of the transaction by having the name entered in the register of members relates it back to the time when the transfer was first made. See Nagabushanam v. Ramachandra Rao (1). During the period that the transfer exists between the transferor and the transferee without emerging as a binding document upon the company, equities exist between them, but not between the transferee and the company. The transferee can call upon the transferor to attend the meeting, vote according to his directions, sign documents in relation to the issuance of fresh capital, call for emergent meetings and inter alia, also compel the transferor to pay such dividend as he may have received. See E. D. Sassoon & Co. Ltd. v. Patch-(2) approved in Mathalone v. Bombay Life Assurance Co. Ltd. (3 ). But these rights though they, no doubt, clothe the transferee with an equitable ownership-, are not sufficient to make the transferee a full owner, since the legal interest vis-a-vis the company still outstands in the transferor; so much so, that the company credits the dividends only to the transferor and also calls upon him to make payment of any unpaid capital, which may be needed. The cases in Black v. Homersham (4) or Wimbush, In re Richards v. Wimbush (5) hardly advance the matter further than this. The position, therefore, under the Indian Com- panies Act, 1913, is quite clear that the expression "

The question that falls for consideration is whether the meaning given to the expression "shareholder" used in s. 18(5) of the Act by these cases is correct. No valid reason exists why " shareholder " as used in s. 18(5) should mean a person other than the one denoted by the same expression in the Indian Companies Act, 1913. In In re Wala Wynaad Indian Gold Mining Company (5), Chitty, J., observed:
and others cited at page 367 in Multipar Syndicate, Ltd. v. Devitt (1).
No one can doubt the correctness of the proposition in these cases, but from an equitable right to compel the transferor to give up the dividend to the transferee, to a claim to the dividend by him as a " shareholder " against the company is a wide jump. In so far as the company is concerned, it does not even issue the certificate under s. 20 of the Income-tax Act in the name of an unregistered transferee but only in the name of the transferor whom it recognises, because his name is borne on its books. Section 20 lays down:	Precedent
The relevant sections are as follows:
It was contended in the High Court that inasmuch as s. 16(2) referred to an I assessee, the assessee company was entitled to have the dividend 'grossed up' by the addition of income- tax paid by the various companies at source and consequently to have the benefit of the credit allowed under the two remaining sections. In the opinion of the High Court, an assessee whose name was not in the register of members of the companies was not entitled to the benefit of these provisions. The learned Judges of the High Court were of the opinion that the word " shareholder " in s.18(5) had the same signification as the word " member "
The share-holders, however, get the benefit of the payment of the tax by the company. Though under (1) [1940] A.C. 51, 56 ; (1939) 22 Tax Cas. 603, 636. (2) [1921] 2 A.C. 171, 201.
s.16(2) of the Act their dividend is increased by a proportionate amount of tax paid by the company, the payment of the tax by the company is deemed tinder ss. 18(5) and 49B(1) to be payment by the shareholders. The rates of income-tax applicable to the company are, in most instances, higher than the rates applicable to the individual shareholders, and by this process of 'grossing up', as it is commonly called, the recipient of the dividend gets some benefit.
The meaning of s. 20 as also of s. 18(5) is clear if they are read with s. 19A, under which information regarding dividends has to be supplied by the company when demanded by the Income-tax Officer. It lays down:
is no separate register of " shareholders " such as the assessee claims to be but only a register of " members ". This takes us immediately to the register of members, and demonstrates that even for the purpose of the Indian Income- tax Act, the words ',member and " shareholder " can be read as synonymous.

other hand, says that the dividend can be increased under s. 16(2) and credit allowed under s. 18(5) if the assessee is a 'shareholder', because the benefit of s. 18(5) can go only to the shareholder, i. e., a person with his name on the register of members, and not to a person holding an equity against such shareholder. The assessee contends that the word " shareholder " includes even a person who holds a share as a result of a blank transfer, and does not necessarily mean a member of the company, whose name is on the register of members.
Authorities on this point are not wanting, and indeed, in the judgment of the Calcutta High Court they have all been referred to. They are all against the assessee. See Shree Shakti Mills Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax (1), Jaluram Bhikulal v. Commissioner of Income-tax (2), Arvind N. Mafatlal v. Incometax Officer (3) and Bikaner Trading Co. v. Commissioner of Income-tax (4).

CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 65 of 1956.
Appeal from the judgment and order dated August 31, 1954, of the Calcutta High Court in Income-tax Ref. No. 57 of 1953. N. C. Chatterjee and B. P. Maheshwari, for the appellant. K. N. Rajagopala Sastri, R. H. Dhebar and D. Gupta, for the respondent.
1959. March 26. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by HIDAYATULLAH, J.-Messrs. Howrah Trading Company, Ltd., Calcutta (hereinafter called the assessee) obtained on April 28, 1955, a certificate under s. 66A(2) of the Indian Income-tax Act from the Calcutta High Court, to appeal to this Court against the judgment dated August 31, 1954, in Income-tax Reference No. 57 of 1953. The Divisional Bench (Chakravarti, C. J., and Lahiri, J.) in the judgment under appeal merely followed their earlier judgment delivered the same day in Income-tax Reference No. 22 of 1953, since reported as Hindustan Investment Corporation v. Commissioner of Income-tax (1). It is the latter judgment which gives the reasons for the decision.
The facts of the case have been stated with sufficient fulness, yet briefly, in the statement of the case submitted by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal (Calcutta Bench) and may be conveniently set out in its own words:
The Income-tax Officer did not accept this claim, and the appeals of the assessee were rejected by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner of Income-tax, Calcutta, " A " Range and by the Appellate Tribunal. The Tribunal, however, on being moved, referred the following question to the High Court:
The High Court answered the question in the negative, thus affirming the decisions of the Department and the Appellate Tribunal.
The assessee contends that the decision of the High Court is erroneous, and that it is entitled to have the dividend income I grossed up' under s. 16(2) and also to claim credit for tax deducted at source, under s.18(5) of the Income-tax Act.
The relevant sections are as follows:

The learned Judges of the High Court were of the opinion that the word " shareholder " in s.18(5) had the same signification as the word " member "
When the company pays its own income-tax and declares a dividend from the balance of its profits, it deducts from such dividend a proportionate part of the amount of the tax paid by it. This principle is explained in another English case, and it is substantially also the law in this country. In Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Blott (2), Viscount Cave stated the law in these words:
The share-holders, however, get the benefit of the payment of the tax by the company. Though under (1) [1940] A.C. 51, 56 ; (1939) 22 Tax Cas. 603, 636. (2) [1921] 2 A.C. 171, 201.
s.16(2) of the Act their dividend is increased by a proportionate amount of tax paid by the company, the payment of the tax by the company is deemed tinder ss. 18(5) and 49B(1) to be payment by the shareholders. The rates of income-tax applicable to the company are, in most instances, higher than the rates applicable to the individual shareholders, and by this process of 'grossing up', as it is commonly called, the recipient of the dividend gets some benefit.
The position of a shareholder who gets dividend when his name stands in the register of members of the company causes no difficulty whatever. But transfers of shares are common, and they take place either by a fully executed document such as was contemplated by Regulation 18 of Table A of the Indian Companies Act 1913, or by what are known as blank transfers'. In such blank transfers, the name of the transferor is entered, and the transfer deed signed by the transferor is handed over with the share scrip to the trans- feree, who, if he so chooses, completes the transfer by entering his name and then applying to the company to register his name in place of the previous holder of the share. The company recognises no person except one whose name is on the register of members, upon whom alone calls for unpaid capital can be made and to whom only the dividend declared by the company is legally payable. Of course, between the transferor and the transferee, certain equities arise even on the execution and handing over of 'a blank transfer', and among these equities is the right of the transferee to claim the dividend declared and paid to the transferor who is treated as a trustee on behalf of the transferee. These equities, however, do not touch the company, and no claim by the transferee whose name is not in the register of members can be made against the company, if the tranferor retains the money in his own hands and fails to pay it to him.
A glance at the scheme of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, shows that the words " member ", " shareholder " and "
share " as " share in the share capital of the company Section 5 deals with the mode of forming incorporated companies, and in the case of companies limited by shares, the liability of the members is limited to the amounts, if any, unpaid on the shares respectively held by them. By s. 18, Table A is made applicable to companies, unless by the Articles of any company the terms of Table A have been excluded or modified. Regulation 18 of Table A reads as follows:

The question that arises in the present case is whether by reason of ss. 16(2) and 18(5) the assessee, who was a transferee on a blank transfer' is entitled to the benefits of the grossing up of the dividend income. Learned counsel for the assessee strenuously contends that the assessee being an owner in equity of the shares and thus also of the dividend is entitled to this benefit. He refers to the use of the word I assessee in s. 16(2). The Department, on the (1) (1922) I.L.R. 45 Mad. 537.

other hand, says that the dividend can be increased under s. 16(2) and credit allowed under s. 18(5) if the assessee is a 'shareholder', because the benefit of s. 18(5) can go only to the shareholder, i. e., a person with his name on the register of members, and not to a person holding an equity against such shareholder. The assessee contends that the word " shareholder " includes even a person who holds a share as a result of a blank transfer, and does not necessarily mean a member of the company, whose name is on the register of members.
Authorities on this point are not wanting, and indeed, in the judgment of the Calcutta High Court they have all been referred to. They are all against the assessee. See Shree Shakti Mills Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax (1), Jaluram Bhikulal v. Commissioner of Income-tax (2), Arvind N. Mafatlal v. Incometax Officer (3) and Bikaner Trading Co. v. Commissioner of Income-tax (4).
The question that falls for consideration is whether the meaning given to the expression "shareholder" used in s. 18(5) of the Act by these cases is correct. No valid reason exists why " shareholder " as used in s. 18(5) should mean a person other than the one denoted by the same expression in the Indian Companies Act, 1913. In In re Wala Wynaad Indian Gold Mining Company (5), Chitty, J., observed:

This takes us immediately to the register of members, and demonstrates that even for the purpose of the Indian Income- tax Act, the words ',member and " shareholder " can be read as synonymous.
The words of s. 18(5) must accordingly be read in the light in which the word " shareholder " has been used in the subsequent sections, and read in that manner, the present assessee, notwithstanding the equitable right to the dividend, was not entitled to be regarded as a "shareholder" for the purpose of s. 18(5) of the Act. That benefit can only go to the person who, both in law and in equity, is to be regarded as the owner of the shares and between whom and the company exists the bond of membership and ownership of a share in the share capital of the company. In view of this, we are satisfied that the answer given by the Calcutta High Court on the question posed by the Tribunal was correct.
The appeal fails, and is dismissed with costs. Appeal dismissed.	Total Judgement
