Burmah Shell Oil Storage And ... vs Commercial Tax Officer And Others on 27 September, 1960	Case Title
JUDGMENT 1961 (1) SCR 902 and Civil Appeal No. 10 of 1958 The Judgment was delivered by HIDAYATULLAH, J.
These two appeals on a certificate under Article 132(1) of the Constitution have been filed respectively by the Burmah Shell Oil Storage and Distributing Co., of India Ltd., and the Standard Vacuum Oil Company (in this judgment referred to as the appellant-companies) against a common judgment of the High Court of Calcutta dated December 7, 1956. The High Court was moved for writs of mandamus, prohibition and certiorari under Article 226, but the petition was dismissed by D. N. Sinha, J. The matter arises out of assessment to sales tax on sale of motor spirit for aviation purposes (shortly, aviation spirit) supplied by the appellant-companies to aircraft bound for countries abroad, under the Bengal Motor Spirit Taxation Act, 1941, as amended by section 2(a)(i) of the Bengal Motor Spirit Sales Taxation (Second Amendment) Act, 1954. The Commercial Tax Officer, the Commissioner of Commercial Taxes and the State of West Bengal have been joined as respondents in this Court, as they had previously been joined in the High Court.
.
By the Bengal Motor Spirit Sales Taxation (Amendment) Act, 1955, the original Act was further amended. To the definition of "motor spirit"	Issue
The appellant-companies deal in petroleum and petroleum products, and carry on business at Calcutta. They maintain supply depots at Dum Dum Airport from which aviation spirit is sold and delivered to aircraft proceeding aboard and belonging to several companies. It appears that such sales were treated by the Sales Tax Authorities in the State of Bombay as not falling within the taxing Acts in force in the Bombay State by reason of the provisions of Article 286 of the Constitution. The Sales Tax Authorities in West Bengal, however, took a different view of the matter, and after sundry procedure resulting in assessment of tax, presented a demand notice for the tax assessed which was paid under protest by the appellant-companies. The appellant-companies files petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution in the High Court of Calcutta questioning the legality of the imposition but without success. They have now filed these appeals after obtaining a certificate, as already stated.The contentions in this Court, as they were also before the High Court, are that such sales are made in the course of export of such aviation spirit out of the territory of India, that they take place outside the State of West Bengal, that inasmuch as aviation spirit is delivered for consumption outside West Bengal the sales cannot fall within the Explanation to sub-clause (a) of the first clause of Article 286, and that unless they can be said to become "Explanation sales", the power to tax does not exist. It is argued in support of the last contention that there is not even an averment in the reply of the respondents before the High Court that aviation spirit is delivered for consumption within West Bengal.	Facts
These two arguments need to be considered separately, as they have little in common. Article 286 places restrictions upon the power of the States to tax sales and purchases of goods, and cuts down the amplitude of Entry No. 54 in the Second List of the Seventh Schedule. Other restrictions are also to be found in Part XIII of the Constitution. With those we are not concerned in these appeals. We are also not concerned with the subsequent amendment of Article 286, nor with the ban imposed by the second clause of the Article on taxes on sales in the course of inter-State trade and commerce. We are concerned with the first clause only, as it stood before the amendment. That clause is divided into two sub-clauses. The first sub- clause prohibits the imposition of tax on the sale or purchase of goods where the sale or purchase takes place outside the State. An Explanation is added to this sub-clause, which has been quoted by us earlier. This Explanation has led to a long controversy in this Court during which somewhat conflicting views have been expressed about its meaning. This conflict has further been accentuated when the interplay between the two clauses has been considered. The view now accepted is that the bans imposed by the two clauses are independent and separate and each much separately be got over. In view of this, we are not required to travel beyond the first clause in this case.We have heard widely divergent arguments in these appeals. The learned Attorney-General who appeared on behalf of the appellant-companies read to us copious extracts from the earlier decisions of this Court, and contended that unless the sales could be said to fall within the Explanation so as to become "Explanation sales", they must be regarded as having taken place outside the State of West Bengal and for that reason, not taxable. According to him, they could only become "Explanation sales" if aviation spirit was delivered for the purpose of consumption within the State of West Bengal. The learned Advocate-General of West Bengal, on the other hand, contended that the Explanation did not apply to the facts here, and that the observations in the rulings were not relevant.
The first sub-clause in its opening portion says that no law of a State shall impose or authorise the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of goods where such sale or purchase takes place outside the State. It is thus plainly meant that a State is not to tax sales which take place outside that State. But, where does a sale take place ? Numerous elements go to make a sale, and they may take place in more than one State. Under the law relating to the sale of goods, property passes on the happening of certain events. When they happen, the sale is complete. Now, a contract for the sale of goods may be entirely within one State when all parties are within the State, the offer and acceptance also take place there, and the goods are also within the State, and there the property in the goods passes and delivery also taken place. But it may also happen that the constituent elements may be spread over two or more States, some of the elements described above falling within one State and some others falling within one or more other States. Prior to the Constitution, multiple taxation of a single transaction of sale was possible, and provincial legislation then existing clearly demonstrates that States having some connection with the sale because one or more elements took place within those States, treated this as sufficient nexus between the taxing power and the States, authorising them to tax sales even where property passed in another State. The Constituent Assembly desired to achieve certain objects in the matter of taxation, particularly in relation to sales tax. Article 286 achieves, among other objects, the avoidance of this multiple taxation.The first sub- clause of the Article is clear in its terms, when it says that a State cannot tax sales which take place outside the State. The converse is also true, that is to say, that a State can tax a sale of goods which takes place within the State. By sale here is meant a completed transaction by which property in the goods passes. Before the property in the goods passes, "the contract of sale is only executory, and the buyer has only a chose in action."
in the extract last quoted, become important. The first question to consider is whether these cases can be governed by the Explanation at all. The learned Attorney-General contends that the power to tax these transactions can only be found if the sales were "Explanation sales", in the sense that the goods were delivered as a direct result of the sale for consumption in West Bengal. In our opinion, the Explanation can apply only if more than one State is involved in the same transaction. When there is no other State in which the goods can be said to be delivered for consumption, apart from the State where the property in the goods passed, the Explanation is not needed as a key. The power to tax in those circumstances which is exercisable by virtue of transfer of title to the property, can only be taken away if there be some other State in which the goods as a direct result of the sale were delivered for consumption. But if there is no such other State, the question does not arise.
The contention is that the sales in question must be regarded as having taken place in circumstances which exempt sales under the sub-clause. This the appellant-companies argue from the following facts that aviation spirit is delivered outside the customs barrier, that aviation spirit is taken out of the territories of India, and that the sales occasion this export. They rely upon the definition of "export" in other Acts to show that the word means no more than "taking out of the country".	RespArg
The High Court of Calcutta in its judgment dealt with the points urged, and rejected them. The reasons of the High Court briefly were as follows : The learned Judges declined to draw any inference from the fact that customs duties were refunded as drawbacks on aviation spirit delivered to the aircraft. He held that he was not required to decide whether the appellant- companies were entitled to claim and receive drawbacks of customs duty. He then gave a finding that the sale was physically within the State, because both the seller and the purchaser were, at the time of sale, within the State of West Bengal, even though delivery of aviation spirit was beyond the customs barrier. He then considered the legal position in the light of Article 286 from three points of view. He first held that it was not an inter-State transaction, because both the parties were in the State of West Bengal, and aviation spirit was not delivered outside the State. Thus, he held that clause (2) of Article 286 did not apply. In this connection, he relied upon the decision of this Court in The Bengal Immunity Co., Ltd. v. State of Bihar and Others ( 1955 (2) SCR 603; 1955 (6) STC 446). He next considered the matter under the first sub-clause, and held that unless the fiction created by the Explanation applied, the sale must be treated as within the State under the law relating to sale of goods. In his opinion, the sale being completed within the State of West Bengal both as regards contract and delivery, the fiction could not be held applicable, because no "outside" State was involved, even though the aircraft might have to consume some aviation spirit which flying over the "outside" State. He, therefore, held that the Explanation and Article 286(1)(a) which it seeks to explain, were both not applicable. He then considered the matter from the point of view of Article 286(1)(b). He explained on the authority of the decision of this Court in State of Travancore-Cochin and Others v. Shanmugha Vilas Cashew-nut Factory and Others ( 1953 (4) STC 205; 1953 AIR(SC) 333), that the expression "in the course of export out of the territory of India" referred to sales which, by themselves, occasioned the export of goods out of the territory of India and not to sales for the purpose of export, even though the goods ultimately passed the customs barrier. He pointed out that there was no foreign purchaser to whom the aviation spirit could be said to have been exported, and that aviation spirit, in fact, was consumed en route and never taken to any foreign territory. He also pointed out that no bills of lading or shipping documents were drawn up, and therefore there was neither an export nor a sale in the course of export out of the territory of India.The appellant- companies claim that these sales come within the exemption of both the sub- clauses (a) and (b) of the first clause of Article 286. To claim the exemption granted by the first sub-clause, they rely upon certain decisions of this Court, and contend that unless the sale can be said to fall within the Explanation, it must be treated as a sale outside the State of West Bengal, and is thus exempt. With regard to the second sub-clause, they contend that there was an export out of the territory of India inasmuch as aviation spirit was taken abroad and any sale by which it is taken abroad is also exempt. These arguments, as has been shown above, were urged before the High Court, but were not accepted.
Starting from the basic fact that what is to be taxed under the Constitution is a sale completed by the transference of property in the goods, we have to see at what stage and where this happens. The taxable event thus cannot be found at any earlier stage when the sale is not completed by the passing of property. The critical taxable event is the passing of property in the goods as a result of a contract for their sale. The parties to the contract can agree when that event is to take place, but where it happens may be a matter of some doubt and even of difficulty. When the parties have not agreed as to the time of the passing of property, the law relating to the sale of goods furnishes the answer. There too, there may be the same difficulty as to the place of the passing of property. The place of physical delivery of the goods does not help to solve this difficulty, because delivery may precede or follow the passing of property in the goods. Delivery of goods is, thus, not always an element which determines the completion of a sale, because the sale may be completed both before and after delivery. The Constitution, however, thinks in terms of a completed sale by the passing of property and not in terms of an executory contract for the sale of goods. The essence of the matter being thus the passing of property in goods, there was always a likelihood of more than one State claiming the right to tax the same transaction. One State might claim that goods in which property passed were in that State, and hence property in the goods passed there. Another State might claim that the conditions precedent to the passing of property were fulfilled in that State and hence the sale was completed by the passing of property there. Yet another State might claim that property passed in that State according as one or more events connected with the passing of property took place within that State.It was to avoid this welter of confusion as far as possible that the Explanation was added, and it also avoided multiple taxation. The Explanation serves two purposes. It indicates the State where the tax can be levied, and also indicates that State or States where it cannot. It achieves that two purposes by excluding all considerations as to where property in the goods can be said to have passed under the law relating to the sale of goods. The purpose is achieved by the Explanation and particularly by the non obstante clause in the Explanation. Any State claiming to tax a sale of goods on the ground that it was completed by the passing of property in the goods in that State could not do so, if the goods as a direct result of the sale were delivered for the purpose of consumption in another State. The Explanation creates a fiction that the sale must be deemed to have taken place in the latter State and not in the State where the sale was completed by reason of passing of property. It thus discards the test of passing of property and adopts the test of delivery "as a direct result of such sale for the purpose of consumption in that State"
Certain reasons were given why this test was adopted, and it is these reasons and their effect on the second clause, which led to a re- examination of the sub-clause in The Bengal Immunity Company Limited v. The State of Bihar and Others ( 1955 (2) SCR 603; 1955 (6) STC 446). The majority in that case touched upon the various grounds which were advanced before this Court, but declined to express "any final opinion upon the matter." The case went on to decide that the bans imposed by the two clauses of Article 286 were independent, and needed to be separately enforced. But, on the meaning of the Explanation, no different view was expressed. Again, in Messrs Ramnarain Sons Ltd. v. Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax and Others ( 1955 (2) SCR 483, 492, 1955 (6) STC 627), it was observed as follows :
In the present cases, there is no such rival State. Where the purchaser buys goods in West Bengal for his own consumption, the test of an "inside sale" is satisfied when the property in the goods passes in the same State and all the elements of the contract of sale also take place inside it. Where the property in the goods passes to a buyer who is also the ultimate consumer, the terms of the Explanation are themselves satisfied. To exclude, thus, the powers of taxation of the State of West Bengal, the appellant-companies must be able to point out some other State where the goods can be said to have been delivered as a direct result of the sale for the purpose of consumption in that other State. Unless they can do so - and they have not so done before us - they cannot invoke the Explanation, and the cases, to borrow the language of the last quotation, cannot be said to be "within that category". In our opinion, the learned Advocate-General of West Bengal was right in his argument (which was accepted by the High Court) that the ban contained in Article 286(1)(a) and the Explanation does not apply,The appellant-companies next rely upon Article 286(1)(b), which provides that :-
This clause of the Article has been construed on previous occasions by this Court, and what is meant by the expression "in the course of" has been well-established. Indeed, in State of Mysore v. Mysore Spinning and Manufacturing Co. Ltd. ( 1958 (9) STC 188; 1958 AIR(SC) 1002), this Court observed that the point could no longer be said to be at large. Fortunately, there is less disagreement on this point than on the interpretation of the Explanation, and it is sufficient to refer to the leading decisions of this Court. The earliest case on the subject is State of Travancore-Cochin and Others v. The Bombay Co. Ltd. ( 1952 SCR 1112; 1952 (3) STC 434), where four possible meanings of the expression "in the course of" were considered. It is not necessary to refer to all of them here, and it is sufficient to point out that of the view that the clause is not restricted to the point of time at which goods are exported from India and that the series of transactions which necessarily precede export of goods also come within the purview of the clause, it was said that it was too wide. It was observed by this Court that :
The meaning of these observations was further explained in State of Travancore-Cochin and Others v. Shanmugha Vilas Cashew-nut Factory and Others ( 1954 SCR 53; 1953 (4) STC 205). It was observed (page 62) that the words "export out of" in this context did not refer to the article or commodity exported, and that the reference to "the goods" and to the "territory of India" made it clear that the words "export out of" meant the exportation out of the country. It was then added that, "The word 'course' etymologically denotes movement from one point to another, and the expression 'in the course of' not only implies a period of time during which the movement is in progress but postulates also a connected relation."	Precedent
Before we take up these two questions, we desire to refer to some provisions of certain Acts, which bear upon the matter. The Indian Aircraft Act, 1934 (22 of 1934) is an Act for the control of the manufacture, possession, use, operation, sale, import and export of aircraft. Section 16 of this Act provides that the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, declare that any or all of the provisions of the Sea Customs Act shall, with such modifications and adaptations as may be specified in the notification, apply to the import and export of goods by air. Sections 2(3) and (4) define "import" and "export" respectively as "bringing into India" and "taking out of India". A notification issued under the Indian Aircraft Act, the rules framed thereunder and the Indian Aircraft Rules, 1920, appointed the Civil Aerodrome, Dum Dum, a Customs Aerodrome, and to that Customs Aerodrome, the provisions of the Sea Customs Act mutatis mutandis were made applicable by rule 63 (Part IX) of the Indian Aircraft Rules, 1920. As a result, Dum Dum Airport became a Customs Aerodrome, and any aircraft coming into India from foreign countries or leaving for any such country has to comply with ordinary customs formalities. Section 42 of the Sea Customs Act, which allows drawback on re-export and is applicable mutatis mutandis, provides :
(Provisos omitted).Under section 51, no drawback is allowed unless the claim to receive such drawback is made and established at the time of re- export, and under section 52, the person claiming drawback has to make and sub-scribe to a declaration. The procedure which is described in an earlier portion of this judgment bears upon these matters.
Coming now to the taxing Acts with which we are concerned, it may be pointed out that the Bengal Motor Spirit Taxation Act, 1941, originally did not contemplate levy of a tax on the sale of aviation spirit. Motor spirit was defined to mean, "any liquid or admixture of liquids which is ordinarily used directly or indirectly as fuel for any form of motor vehicle or stationary internal cumbustion engine, and which has a flashing point below 76 degrees Fahrenheit"
.The original Act was again amended by the Bengal Motor Spirit Sales Taxation (Amendment) Act, 1957. This time, among other amendments involving rates of tax, the words "and which has a flashing point below 76 degrees Fahrenheit" were omitted from the definition of "motor spirit." The result of all these amendments was to make retail sales of aviation spirit liable to sales tax, and "retail sale" was defined, at all material times, as a sale "by a retail dealer for the purpose of consumption by the purchaser".
After the coming into force of the Constitution, section 22, in terms of Article 286, was added to the original Act by paragraph 3 of, and the Eleventh Schedule to, the Adaptation of Laws Order, 1950. It read :
.
Clause (a) and (b) of the first sub-section do no more than re-enact the prohibition contained in Article 286 of the Constitution with modifications to suit motor spirit, and the Explanation to sub-clause (a) of clause (1) of the said Article in the Constitution has been applied without an attempt to modify or adapt it. The Explanation to sub-clause (a) of the first clause of Article 286, the meaning of which was much in dispute in this case, may conveniently be quoted here. It reads :-
.
Property in the goods passes either by the fulfilment of the conditions of the contract, if any, or by the operation of the law relating to the sale of goods.
This inter-connection of the sale sought to be taxed with the course of export was emphasised again in clear terms thus :	Section
These sales must, therefore, be treated as made within the State of West Bengal. The customs barrier is a barrier for customs purposes, and duty drawback may be admissible if the goods once imported are taken out of the country. The customs duty drawbacks have noting to do with the sale of aviation spirit, which takes place in West Bengal. The customs barrier does not set a terminal limit to the territory of West Bengal for sales tax purposes. The sale beyond the customs barrier is still a sale, in fact, in the State of West Bengal. Both the buyer and the seller are in that State. The goods are also there. All the elements of sale including delivery, payment of price, take place within the State. The sale is thus completely within the territory of the taxing state. No outside State is involved where the goods can be aid to have been delivered for consumption as a direct result of the sale that takes place. Article 286(1)(a) and the Explanation are wholly inapplicable, and the sale cannot even, by a fiction, be said to be outside the State of West Bengal. No doubt, aviation spirit is taken out of the State and also the territory of India, but it cannot be said to have been exported or delivered for consumption in some other State. The so-called export is not occasioned by the sale, and the sale, on the authorities cited, is not in the course of "export", so as to attract Article 286(1)(b).The decision of the High Court was correct. The appeals fail, and are dismissed with costs. One hearing fee.	Conclusion
JUDGMENT 1961 (1) SCR 902 and Civil Appeal No. 10 of 1958 The Judgment was delivered by HIDAYATULLAH, J.
These two appeals on a certificate under Article 132(1) of the Constitution have been filed respectively by the Burmah Shell Oil Storage and Distributing Co., of India Ltd., and the Standard Vacuum Oil Company (in this judgment referred to as the appellant-companies) against a common judgment of the High Court of Calcutta dated December 7, 1956. The High Court was moved for writs of mandamus, prohibition and certiorari under Article 226, but the petition was dismissed by D. N. Sinha, J. The matter arises out of assessment to sales tax on sale of motor spirit for aviation purposes (shortly, aviation spirit) supplied by the appellant-companies to aircraft bound for countries abroad, under the Bengal Motor Spirit Taxation Act, 1941, as amended by section 2(a)(i) of the Bengal Motor Spirit Sales Taxation (Second Amendment) Act, 1954. The Commercial Tax Officer, the Commissioner of Commercial Taxes and the State of West Bengal have been joined as respondents in this Court, as they had previously been joined in the High Court.
The appellant-companies deal in petroleum and petroleum products, and carry on business at Calcutta. They maintain supply depots at Dum Dum Airport from which aviation spirit is sold and delivered to aircraft proceeding aboard and belonging to several companies. It appears that such sales were treated by the Sales Tax Authorities in the State of Bombay as not falling within the taxing Acts in force in the Bombay State by reason of the provisions of Article 286 of the Constitution. The Sales Tax Authorities in West Bengal, however, took a different view of the matter, and after sundry procedure resulting in assessment of tax, presented a demand notice for the tax assessed which was paid under protest by the appellant-companies. The appellant-companies files petitions under Article 226 of the Constitution in the High Court of Calcutta questioning the legality of the imposition but without success. They have now filed these appeals after obtaining a certificate, as already stated.The contentions in this Court, as they were also before the High Court, are that such sales are made in the course of export of such aviation spirit out of the territory of India, that they take place outside the State of West Bengal, that inasmuch as aviation spirit is delivered for consumption outside West Bengal the sales cannot fall within the Explanation to sub-clause (a) of the first clause of Article 286, and that unless they can be said to become "Explanation sales", the power to tax does not exist. It is argued in support of the last contention that there is not even an averment in the reply of the respondents before the High Court that aviation spirit is delivered for consumption within West Bengal.
The case in the High Court was restricted to consideration of supplies to aircraft which either proceed to foreign countries directly from Dum Dum Airport, or do so ultimately, though landing en route at some place or places in the Indian territory. The case has been similarly confined in this Court also, and we are not required to express any opinion about sales of aviation spirit to aircraft flying from one place in West Bengal to another place also within that State, or even to some place in another State in the territory of India.
The facts are fortunately not in dispute. Both parties admitted the procedure for the supply of aviation spirit to aircraft. Briefly described, it is as follows : Before the arrival of such an aircraft, a representative of the appellant-companies applies to the Airport Customs Officer to depute an officer to supervise the refuelling of the aircraft. After the aircraft lands, the captain or the ground engineer gives instruction about the quantity of aviation spirit required, and on permission being given by the Customs Authorities, the stated quantity is delivered in the presence of the Customs Officer deputed. Details of the delivery are entered in a delivery receipt, which is signed by the representative of the appellant- companies and the Customs Officer deputed. Duty drawback shipping bills are also drawn up to show the quantity of aviation spirit and are countersigned by them and also by a representative of the aircraft. Later, claims for refund of customs duty are made, and refund is granted.In the petition filed in the High Court, it was averred that such aviation spirit is required for consumption during flight and/or outside the territory of India, and is thus delivered for purposes of consumption outside West Bengal and in some cases outside the territorial limits of India as well. It was also stated that it was sold in the course of export outside the territory of India, and drawback of customs duty was obtained. In the reply of the respondents, it was stated that the refund of customs duty was an irrelevant fact for the purpose of assessment. It was further stated in the affidavit of the Commercial Tax Officer as follows :
We have mentioned this fact, because it was argued that the respondents had not averred clearly that aviation spirit was sold for consumption within West Bengal even though the appellant-companies had denied it. The respondents pointed out that at least some of the aviation spirit must be consumed in the State, and that this was also stated in the affidavit filed in reply to the petition and quoted by us. This is hardly a case for a fight on pleadings, especially as the entire procedure of the supply of aviation spirit and the use to which it is put are beyond controversy. The question that we have to consider is one of principle, and the answer depends upon broad facts and not on technicalities. Either the whole of the sale is within the taxing power of the State or it is not, and the fact that aviation spirit is consumed in taking off or in flying over the territory of West Bengal before it leaves that territory would make no difference either way to the principles applicable. Though parties entered into a debate on this part of the case, we do not propose to consider it, because, in our opinion, the question must be considered in substance and not in abstractions. The liability to sales tax, if any, is attracted when aviation sprit is sold, and immunity can only be claimed, if, as stated in Article 286(1)(a) and the Explanation, the sale can be said to take place outside the State or can be regarded under Article 286(1)(b) as having taken place "in the course of ....... export of the goods out of, the territory of India."
Before we take up these two questions, we desire to refer to some provisions of certain Acts, which bear upon the matter. The Indian Aircraft Act, 1934 (22 of 1934) is an Act for the control of the manufacture, possession, use, operation, sale, import and export of aircraft. Section 16 of this Act provides that the Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, declare that any or all of the provisions of the Sea Customs Act shall, with such modifications and adaptations as may be specified in the notification, apply to the import and export of goods by air. Sections 2(3) and (4) define "import" and "export" respectively as "bringing into India" and "taking out of India". A notification issued under the Indian Aircraft Act, the rules framed thereunder and the Indian Aircraft Rules, 1920, appointed the Civil Aerodrome, Dum Dum, a Customs Aerodrome, and to that Customs Aerodrome, the provisions of the Sea Customs Act mutatis mutandis were made applicable by rule 63 (Part IX) of the Indian Aircraft Rules, 1920. As a result, Dum Dum Airport became a Customs Aerodrome, and any aircraft coming into India from foreign countries or leaving for any such country has to comply with ordinary customs formalities. Section 42 of the Sea Customs Act, which allows drawback on re-export and is applicable mutatis mutandis, provides :
(Provisos omitted).Under section 51, no drawback is allowed unless the claim to receive such drawback is made and established at the time of re- export, and under section 52, the person claiming drawback has to make and sub-scribe to a declaration. The procedure which is described in an earlier portion of this judgment bears upon these matters.
Coming now to the taxing Acts with which we are concerned, it may be pointed out that the Bengal Motor Spirit Taxation Act, 1941, originally did not contemplate levy of a tax on the sale of aviation spirit. Motor spirit was defined to mean, "any liquid or admixture of liquids which is ordinarily used directly or indirectly as fuel for any form of motor vehicle or stationary internal cumbustion engine, and which has a flashing point below 76 degrees Fahrenheit"
.
By the Bengal Motor Spirit Sales Taxation (Amendment) Act, 1955, the original Act was further amended. To the definition of "motor spirit"
.The original Act was again amended by the Bengal Motor Spirit Sales Taxation (Amendment) Act, 1957. This time, among other amendments involving rates of tax, the words "and which has a flashing point below 76 degrees Fahrenheit" were omitted from the definition of "motor spirit." The result of all these amendments was to make retail sales of aviation spirit liable to sales tax, and "retail sale" was defined, at all material times, as a sale "by a retail dealer for the purpose of consumption by the purchaser".
After the coming into force of the Constitution, section 22, in terms of Article 286, was added to the original Act by paragraph 3 of, and the Eleventh Schedule to, the Adaptation of Laws Order, 1950. It read :
.
Clause (a) and (b) of the first sub-section do no more than re-enact the prohibition contained in Article 286 of the Constitution with modifications to suit motor spirit, and the Explanation to sub-clause (a) of clause (1) of the said Article in the Constitution has been applied without an attempt to modify or adapt it. The Explanation to sub-clause (a) of the first clause of Article 286, the meaning of which was much in dispute in this case, may conveniently be quoted here. It reads :-
.
The High Court of Calcutta in its judgment dealt with the points urged, and rejected them. The reasons of the High Court briefly were as follows : The learned Judges declined to draw any inference from the fact that customs duties were refunded as drawbacks on aviation spirit delivered to the aircraft. He held that he was not required to decide whether the appellant- companies were entitled to claim and receive drawbacks of customs duty. He then gave a finding that the sale was physically within the State, because both the seller and the purchaser were, at the time of sale, within the State of West Bengal, even though delivery of aviation spirit was beyond the customs barrier. He then considered the legal position in the light of Article 286 from three points of view. He first held that it was not an inter-State transaction, because both the parties were in the State of West Bengal, and aviation spirit was not delivered outside the State. Thus, he held that clause (2) of Article 286 did not apply. In this connection, he relied upon the decision of this Court in The Bengal Immunity Co., Ltd. v. State of Bihar and Others ( 1955 (2) SCR 603; 1955 (6) STC 446). He next considered the matter under the first sub-clause, and held that unless the fiction created by the Explanation applied, the sale must be treated as within the State under the law relating to sale of goods. In his opinion, the sale being completed within the State of West Bengal both as regards contract and delivery, the fiction could not be held applicable, because no "outside" State was involved, even though the aircraft might have to consume some aviation spirit which flying over the "outside" State. He, therefore, held that the Explanation and Article 286(1)(a) which it seeks to explain, were both not applicable. He then considered the matter from the point of view of Article 286(1)(b). He explained on the authority of the decision of this Court in State of Travancore-Cochin and Others v. Shanmugha Vilas Cashew-nut Factory and Others ( 1953 (4) STC 205; 1953 AIR(SC) 333), that the expression "in the course of export out of the territory of India" referred to sales which, by themselves, occasioned the export of goods out of the territory of India and not to sales for the purpose of export, even though the goods ultimately passed the customs barrier. He pointed out that there was no foreign purchaser to whom the aviation spirit could be said to have been exported, and that aviation spirit, in fact, was consumed en route and never taken to any foreign territory. He also pointed out that no bills of lading or shipping documents were drawn up, and therefore there was neither an export nor a sale in the course of export out of the territory of India.The appellant- companies claim that these sales come within the exemption of both the sub- clauses (a) and (b) of the first clause of Article 286. To claim the exemption granted by the first sub-clause, they rely upon certain decisions of this Court, and contend that unless the sale can be said to fall within the Explanation, it must be treated as a sale outside the State of West Bengal, and is thus exempt. With regard to the second sub-clause, they contend that there was an export out of the territory of India inasmuch as aviation spirit was taken abroad and any sale by which it is taken abroad is also exempt. These arguments, as has been shown above, were urged before the High Court, but were not accepted.
These two arguments need to be considered separately, as they have little in common. Article 286 places restrictions upon the power of the States to tax sales and purchases of goods, and cuts down the amplitude of Entry No. 54 in the Second List of the Seventh Schedule. Other restrictions are also to be found in Part XIII of the Constitution. With those we are not concerned in these appeals. We are also not concerned with the subsequent amendment of Article 286, nor with the ban imposed by the second clause of the Article on taxes on sales in the course of inter-State trade and commerce. We are concerned with the first clause only, as it stood before the amendment. That clause is divided into two sub-clauses. The first sub- clause prohibits the imposition of tax on the sale or purchase of goods where the sale or purchase takes place outside the State. An Explanation is added to this sub-clause, which has been quoted by us earlier. This Explanation has led to a long controversy in this Court during which somewhat conflicting views have been expressed about its meaning. This conflict has further been accentuated when the interplay between the two clauses has been considered. The view now accepted is that the bans imposed by the two clauses are independent and separate and each much separately be got over. In view of this, we are not required to travel beyond the first clause in this case.We have heard widely divergent arguments in these appeals. The learned Attorney-General who appeared on behalf of the appellant-companies read to us copious extracts from the earlier decisions of this Court, and contended that unless the sales could be said to fall within the Explanation so as to become "Explanation sales", they must be regarded as having taken place outside the State of West Bengal and for that reason, not taxable. According to him, they could only become "Explanation sales" if aviation spirit was delivered for the purpose of consumption within the State of West Bengal. The learned Advocate-General of West Bengal, on the other hand, contended that the Explanation did not apply to the facts here, and that the observations in the rulings were not relevant.
The first sub-clause in its opening portion says that no law of a State shall impose or authorise the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of goods where such sale or purchase takes place outside the State. It is thus plainly meant that a State is not to tax sales which take place outside that State. But, where does a sale take place ? Numerous elements go to make a sale, and they may take place in more than one State. Under the law relating to the sale of goods, property passes on the happening of certain events. When they happen, the sale is complete. Now, a contract for the sale of goods may be entirely within one State when all parties are within the State, the offer and acceptance also take place there, and the goods are also within the State, and there the property in the goods passes and delivery also taken place. But it may also happen that the constituent elements may be spread over two or more States, some of the elements described above falling within one State and some others falling within one or more other States. Prior to the Constitution, multiple taxation of a single transaction of sale was possible, and provincial legislation then existing clearly demonstrates that States having some connection with the sale because one or more elements took place within those States, treated this as sufficient nexus between the taxing power and the States, authorising them to tax sales even where property passed in another State. The Constituent Assembly desired to achieve certain objects in the matter of taxation, particularly in relation to sales tax. Article 286 achieves, among other objects, the avoidance of this multiple taxation.The first sub- clause of the Article is clear in its terms, when it says that a State cannot tax sales which take place outside the State. The converse is also true, that is to say, that a State can tax a sale of goods which takes place within the State. By sale here is meant a completed transaction by which property in the goods passes. Before the property in the goods passes, "the contract of sale is only executory, and the buyer has only a chose in action."
Property in the goods passes either by the fulfilment of the conditions of the contract, if any, or by the operation of the law relating to the sale of goods.
Starting from the basic fact that what is to be taxed under the Constitution is a sale completed by the transference of property in the goods, we have to see at what stage and where this happens. The taxable event thus cannot be found at any earlier stage when the sale is not completed by the passing of property. The critical taxable event is the passing of property in the goods as a result of a contract for their sale. The parties to the contract can agree when that event is to take place, but where it happens may be a matter of some doubt and even of difficulty. When the parties have not agreed as to the time of the passing of property, the law relating to the sale of goods furnishes the answer. There too, there may be the same difficulty as to the place of the passing of property. The place of physical delivery of the goods does not help to solve this difficulty, because delivery may precede or follow the passing of property in the goods. Delivery of goods is, thus, not always an element which determines the completion of a sale, because the sale may be completed both before and after delivery. The Constitution, however, thinks in terms of a completed sale by the passing of property and not in terms of an executory contract for the sale of goods. The essence of the matter being thus the passing of property in goods, there was always a likelihood of more than one State claiming the right to tax the same transaction. One State might claim that goods in which property passed were in that State, and hence property in the goods passed there. Another State might claim that the conditions precedent to the passing of property were fulfilled in that State and hence the sale was completed by the passing of property there. Yet another State might claim that property passed in that State according as one or more events connected with the passing of property took place within that State.It was to avoid this welter of confusion as far as possible that the Explanation was added, and it also avoided multiple taxation. The Explanation serves two purposes. It indicates the State where the tax can be levied, and also indicates that State or States where it cannot. It achieves that two purposes by excluding all considerations as to where property in the goods can be said to have passed under the law relating to the sale of goods. The purpose is achieved by the Explanation and particularly by the non obstante clause in the Explanation. Any State claiming to tax a sale of goods on the ground that it was completed by the passing of property in the goods in that State could not do so, if the goods as a direct result of the sale were delivered for the purpose of consumption in another State. The Explanation creates a fiction that the sale must be deemed to have taken place in the latter State and not in the State where the sale was completed by reason of passing of property. It thus discards the test of passing of property and adopts the test of delivery "as a direct result of such sale for the purpose of consumption in that State"
Certain reasons were given why this test was adopted, and it is these reasons and their effect on the second clause, which led to a re- examination of the sub-clause in The Bengal Immunity Company Limited v. The State of Bihar and Others ( 1955 (2) SCR 603; 1955 (6) STC 446). The majority in that case touched upon the various grounds which were advanced before this Court, but declined to express "any final opinion upon the matter." The case went on to decide that the bans imposed by the two clauses of Article 286 were independent, and needed to be separately enforced. But, on the meaning of the Explanation, no different view was expressed. Again, in Messrs Ramnarain Sons Ltd. v. Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax and Others ( 1955 (2) SCR 483, 492, 1955 (6) STC 627), it was observed as follows :
in the extract last quoted, become important. The first question to consider is whether these cases can be governed by the Explanation at all. The learned Attorney-General contends that the power to tax these transactions can only be found if the sales were "Explanation sales", in the sense that the goods were delivered as a direct result of the sale for consumption in West Bengal. In our opinion, the Explanation can apply only if more than one State is involved in the same transaction. When there is no other State in which the goods can be said to be delivered for consumption, apart from the State where the property in the goods passed, the Explanation is not needed as a key. The power to tax in those circumstances which is exercisable by virtue of transfer of title to the property, can only be taken away if there be some other State in which the goods as a direct result of the sale were delivered for consumption. But if there is no such other State, the question does not arise.
In the present cases, there is no such rival State. Where the purchaser buys goods in West Bengal for his own consumption, the test of an "inside sale" is satisfied when the property in the goods passes in the same State and all the elements of the contract of sale also take place inside it. Where the property in the goods passes to a buyer who is also the ultimate consumer, the terms of the Explanation are themselves satisfied. To exclude, thus, the powers of taxation of the State of West Bengal, the appellant-companies must be able to point out some other State where the goods can be said to have been delivered as a direct result of the sale for the purpose of consumption in that other State. Unless they can do so - and they have not so done before us - they cannot invoke the Explanation, and the cases, to borrow the language of the last quotation, cannot be said to be "within that category". In our opinion, the learned Advocate-General of West Bengal was right in his argument (which was accepted by the High Court) that the ban contained in Article 286(1)(a) and the Explanation does not apply,The appellant-companies next rely upon Article 286(1)(b), which provides that :-
The contention is that the sales in question must be regarded as having taken place in circumstances which exempt sales under the sub-clause. This the appellant-companies argue from the following facts that aviation spirit is delivered outside the customs barrier, that aviation spirit is taken out of the territories of India, and that the sales occasion this export. They rely upon the definition of "export" in other Acts to show that the word means no more than "taking out of the country".
This clause of the Article has been construed on previous occasions by this Court, and what is meant by the expression "in the course of" has been well-established. Indeed, in State of Mysore v. Mysore Spinning and Manufacturing Co. Ltd. ( 1958 (9) STC 188; 1958 AIR(SC) 1002), this Court observed that the point could no longer be said to be at large. Fortunately, there is less disagreement on this point than on the interpretation of the Explanation, and it is sufficient to refer to the leading decisions of this Court. The earliest case on the subject is State of Travancore-Cochin and Others v. The Bombay Co. Ltd. ( 1952 SCR 1112; 1952 (3) STC 434), where four possible meanings of the expression "in the course of" were considered. It is not necessary to refer to all of them here, and it is sufficient to point out that of the view that the clause is not restricted to the point of time at which goods are exported from India and that the series of transactions which necessarily precede export of goods also come within the purview of the clause, it was said that it was too wide. It was observed by this Court that :
The meaning of these observations was further explained in State of Travancore-Cochin and Others v. Shanmugha Vilas Cashew-nut Factory and Others ( 1954 SCR 53; 1953 (4) STC 205). It was observed (page 62) that the words "export out of" in this context did not refer to the article or commodity exported, and that the reference to "the goods" and to the "territory of India" made it clear that the words "export out of" meant the exportation out of the country. It was then added that, "The word 'course' etymologically denotes movement from one point to another, and the expression 'in the course of' not only implies a period of time during which the movement is in progress but postulates also a connected relation."
This inter-connection of the sale sought to be taxed with the course of export was emphasised again in clear terms thus :
In the earlier cases, it was not necessary to explain the meaning of the word "export", because there was always a foreign buyer to whom the goods were ultimately sent. In none of the cases the facts found here were present. Here, the buyer does not export the goods to a foreign country, but purchases them for his own use on the journey of the aircraft to foreign countries. This difference is vital, and makes the position of the appellant-companies, if anything, weaker. It is for this reason that the appellant-companies depend on a wide meaning of the word "export", which they illustrate from other Acts where the word is tantamount to "taking out of the country". We are of opinion that this meaning cannot be given to the word "export" in the clause. The word "export" may conceivably be used in more senses than one. In one sense, "export" may mean sending or taking out of the country, but in another sense, it may mean sending goods from one country to another. Often, the latter involves a commercial transaction but not necessarily. The country to which the goods are thus sent is said to import them, and the words "export" and "import" in this sense are complementary. An illustration will express this difference vividly. Goods cannot be said to be exported if they are ordered by the health authorities to be destroyed by dumping them in the sea, and for that purpose are taken out of the territories of India and beyond the territorial waters and dumped in the open sea. Conversely, goods put on board a steamer bound for a foreign country but jettisoned can still be said to have been "exported", even though they do not reach their destination. In the one case, there is no export, and in the other, there is, though in either case the goods go to the bottom of the sea. The first would not be within the exemption even if a sale was involved, while any sale in the course of the second taking out would be. In both, the goods were taken out of the country. The difference lies in the fact that whereas the goods, in the first example, had no foreign destination, the goods, in the second example, had. It means, therefore, that while all exports involve a taking out of the country, all goods taken out of the country cannot be said to be exported. The test is that the goods must have a foreign destination where they can be said to be imported. It matters not that there is no valuable consideration from the receiver at the destination end. If the goods are exported and there is sale or purchase in the course of that export and the sale or purchase occasions the export to a foreign destination, the exemption is earned. Purchases made by philanthropists of goods in the course of export to foreign countries to alleviate distress there, may still be exempted, even though the sending of the goods was not a commercial venture but a charitable one. The crucial fact is the sending of the goods to a foreign destination where they would be received as imports. The two notions of export and import, thus, go in pairs.Applying these several tests to the cases on hand, it is quite plain that aviation spirit loaded on board an aircraft for consumption, though taken out of the country, is not exported since it has no destination where it can be said to be imported, and so long as it does not satisfy this test, it cannot be said that the sale was in the course of export. Further, as has already been pointed out, the sales can hardly be said to "occasion" the export. The seller sells aviation spirit for the use of the aircraft, and the sale is not integrally connected with the taking out of aviation spirit. The sale is not even for the purpose of export, as explained above. It does not come within the course of export, which requires an even deeper relation. The sales, thus, do not come within Article 286(1)(b).
These sales must, therefore, be treated as made within the State of West Bengal. The customs barrier is a barrier for customs purposes, and duty drawback may be admissible if the goods once imported are taken out of the country. The customs duty drawbacks have noting to do with the sale of aviation spirit, which takes place in West Bengal. The customs barrier does not set a terminal limit to the territory of West Bengal for sales tax purposes. The sale beyond the customs barrier is still a sale, in fact, in the State of West Bengal. Both the buyer and the seller are in that State. The goods are also there. All the elements of sale including delivery, payment of price, take place within the State. The sale is thus completely within the territory of the taxing state. No outside State is involved where the goods can be aid to have been delivered for consumption as a direct result of the sale that takes place. Article 286(1)(a) and the Explanation are wholly inapplicable, and the sale cannot even, by a fiction, be said to be outside the State of West Bengal. No doubt, aviation spirit is taken out of the State and also the territory of India, but it cannot be said to have been exported or delivered for consumption in some other State. The so-called export is not occasioned by the sale, and the sale, on the authorities cited, is not in the course of "export", so as to attract Article 286(1)(b).The decision of the High Court was correct. The appeals fail, and are dismissed with costs. One hearing fee.	Total Judgement
