CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 381 of 1956.
Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated February 24, 1955, of the Bombay High Court in Income-Tax Reference No. 52/X of 1954.
H. N. Sanyal, Additional Solicitor-General of India, G. N. Joshi and R. H. Dhebar, for the respondent. 1958. May 12. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMA AIYAR J.-This is an appeal against the judgment of the High Court of Bombay in a reference under s. 66(1) of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, hereinafter referred to as the Act.	Issue
The appellant is a private limited company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, and is carrying on business as marine engineers and ship repairers. Its registered office is in Bombay and it is resident and ordinarily resident in India. Its entire share capital is beneficially owned by two British companies, the P. & 0. Steam Navigation Co. Ltd., and the British Indian Steam Navigation Co. Ltd., whose business consists in plying ships for hire. Under an agreement entered into with the two companies aforesaid, which will be referred to hereinafter as the non-resident companies; the appellant repairs their ships at cost, and charges no profits. Now, the point for determination is whether, on these facts, the appellant is chargeable to tax under s. 42(2) of the Act. That sub-section runs as follows:
The Income-tax Officer, Bombay who dealt with the matter took the view that the appellant company had so arranged its business with the non-resident companies that it did not produce any profits to it, and that was because it was those companies that really owned its share capital, and that therefore the profits which it could ordinarily have made but for their close financial connection were liable to be taxed under s. 42(2), and he computed the same at Rs. 6,80,000 for the account year 1943-1944, at Rs. 4,67,559 for the account year 1944-1945 and at Rs. 4,68,963 for the account year 1945-46. On the basis of the above findings, orders of assessment of income-tax were made for the account years 1944-1945 and 1945-1946 and of excess profits tax for the account years 1943-1944, 1944-1945 and 1945-1946. Against these five orders, the appellant preferred appeals to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, who by his order dated July 3, 1952, confirmed the same. Then there was a further appeal by the appellant to the Appellate Tribunal, and the Bench which heard the same having been divided in its opinion, the matters came up for hearing before the President, who by his order dated March 19, 1954, held that s. 42(2) was inapplicable and he accordingly set aside the orders of assessment of income-tax and excess profits tax made on the appellant. On the application of the Department, the Tribunal referred the following question for the opinion of the High Court of Bombay:
The reference was heard by Chagla C. J. and Tendolkar J. who by their judgment dated February 24, 1955, held that, on the facts found, s. 42(2) was applicable and that the appellant was liable to be assessed to income-tax and excess profits tax under that section. The appellant applied under s. 66(A) for leave to appeal against this judgment to this court, and that application was dismissed. The appellant thereafter applied for and obtained leave to appeal to this Court under Art. 136, and hence this appeal. It must be mentioned that on December 31, 1948, an order of assessment bad been made in respect of the income-tax payable by the appellant for the account year 1943-1944, and therein, the profits chargeable under s. 42(2) had not been included. But subsequently, the Income-tax Officer took action under s. 34 of the Act, and on May 29, 1953, made an order assessing the appellant to tax for that year on the profits deemed to have been made by it under s. 42(2), and against that order, an appeal is pending before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner. That order is not the subject-matter of the present proceedings, which are concerned only with the assessment of income-tax for the account years 1944-1945 and 1945-1946 and of excess profits tax for the account years 1943-1944, 1944-1945 and 1945- 1946.	Facts

The appellant also relied on the clauses in s. 42 (2) that the profits shall be chargeable to tax in the name of the resident' and that he shall be deemed to be the assessee for all purposes of the Act' as indicating that it is not the business of the resident that is really sought to be taxed. But these clauses are explainable with reference to the fact that the profits taxed are not actual profits but what are deemed to be profits. It was argued that if it was the intention of the legislature that what was not profits should be deemed to be profits, that should have been independently provided for before the tax is imposed, and that in the absence of such a provision, the word " deemed "
It was argued that the result of this arrangement was only to reduce the repairing charges and enable the non-resident Companies to thereby make a saving; that that was not profit or gains of a business liable to be taxed under the Act, and the decisions in Tennant v. Smith (1) and In re Major John(") -were cited in sup. port of this position. But, as already held by us, the subject-matter of the tax under s. 42(2) is the business of the resident and not that of the non-resident, and what we have to decide is not whether the nonresident Companies made profits in their dealings with the appellant but whether what they did was business, and for that purpose it is immaterial that the business was carried on by them in such manner that no profits could accrue to them therefrom. Vide the observations of Coleridge C. J. at p. 113 in Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Incorporated Council of Law Reporting (3 ). The fact therefore that the nonresident Companies could derive no profits from the dealings with the appellant would not detract from their character as business with the appellant. This contention must, therefore, be rejected. It was finally contended that the profits chargeable under s. 42(2) must be separately assessed and not added on to the other profits or income of the appellant. This contention is based on the assumption that s. 42(2) imposes on the appellant, a vicarious liability, the charge being in reality on the profits of the nonresident. On our finding that the charge is on the business of the appellant and not of the non-resident Companies, this contention does not survive.	RespArg
'The word business' connotes", it was observed by this Court in Narain Swadeshi Weaving Mills v. The Commissioner of Excess Profits Tax (2), "some real, substantial and systematic or organised course of activity or conduct with a set purpose." Now, it may be conceded that when a person purchases his requirements from a particular dealer, he cannot without more be said to carry on business with him. But here there is much more. The non-resident companies send their ships for repair to the appellant, not as they might to any other repairer but under a special agreement that repairs should be done at cost. And further unlike customers who purchase goods for their own consumption or use, the non-resident companies get their ships repaired for use in what is admittedly their business. These are clearly trading activities, organised and continuous in their character and it will be difficult to escape the conclusion that they constitute business. We are not even concerned in this appeal with the larger question whether the activities of the nonresident companies in connection with the repair of the ships amount to carrying on of business. What we have to decide is whether having regard to the (1) (1946) 28 Tax Cas. 250, 259.
course of dealings between the non-resident companies and the appellant it can be said of the former that they carry on business with the latter within the meaning of s. 42(2). Now, it should be observed that s. 42 speaks not of the nonresidents carrying on business in the abstract but of their carrying on business with the resident, and in the context, it must include all activities between them having relationship to their business. That is the view taken by the learned Judges in the Court below, and we are in agreement with it.
In this connection, reference may be made to s. 42(1) under which a charge is imposed on income, profits or gains accruing to a non-resident through any business connection in the taxable territories. In Commissioner of Income-tax v. Curimbhoy Ebrahim & Sons (1), it was observed by the Privy Council that business connection in s. 42(1) is different from business as defined in s. 4(2) of the Act. "	Precedent
Now, the sole point for determination in this appeal is whether on the facts found the appellant is chargeable to tax under s. 42 (2) of the Act. Mr. Palkhivala, learned counsel for the appellant, contends that it is not, and urges two grounds in support of his contention: (1) that s. 42(2) imposes a charge only on a business carried on by a nonresident, and that therefore no tax could be imposed under that provision on the business of the appellant who is a resident; and (2) that it is a condition for the levy of a charge under s.42 (2) that the non-resident must carry on business with the resident, and that in the instant case it is not satisfied. The first ground does not appear to have been put forward in the Court below, but before us it has been presented with great elaboration and pressed with considerable insistence. The argument in support of it may thus be stated: S. 42 (2) imposes a charge on profits of a business, actual or notional, when the conditions specified therein are satisfied; but the section does not, in terms, say who the person is whose business is liable to be taxed, but that that can only be the non-resident is clear from other parts of the section. Thus, the tax is imposed under s. 42 (2) on profits " derived " from business, which must mean profits actually made therein. Ex hypothesi, the resident has so arranged his business that it produces little or no profits to him. If it has produced some profits, then they are taxable in his hands even apart from this provision, and if he has made no profits, then the word " derived " would be inapplicable to his business. Therefore, the profits " derived " and taxable under the section can have reference only to the business of a non- resident. Then again, the profits are chargeable under this section in the name of the resident. If the profits chargeable under s. 42(2) accrue from a business of the resident, he would be the person who would, even apart from the section, be liable for the tax, and in that situation, the expression " in the name of the resident " would be inappropriate. It would make sense if, in fact, the profits accrued in a business carried on by a person other than the resident, and the legislature sought to tax them in his hands. The true intention behind the legislation, it is said, is that the profits of the non-resident should be taxed, but that the tax should fall on the resident by reason of his close connection with the nonresident. Support for this contention is sought in the provision in s. 42 (2) that the resident shall be deemed to be the assessee for all purposes of the Act. The word " deemed " imports, it is argued, a legal fiction, and if it was the, business of the resident that was intended to be taxed, then he is, in fact, the assessee, and it would be' inconsistent with that position that he should be treated as an assessee by a legal fiction. It is also urged that sub-ss. (1) and (3) of s. 42 deal with the profits of a nonresident and prescribe the conditions under which and the manner in which the tax could be imposed and collected, and s. 42 (2) must in this setting, be construed as referring to the business of the nonresident. There would have been considerable force in this argument, had there been any ambiguity or undertainty in the wording of s. 42 (2) as to whether it is the business of the resident that is sought to be taxed or that of the nonresident. But that is not so. The language of the enactment imposing the charge is too plain to admit of any doubt. Now, s. 42 (2) is, it may be noted, in two parts. The first part commencing with the opening words " Where a person not resident " and ending with the words " which may reasonably be deemed to have been derived therefrom "
has reference to the arrangement between the nonresident and the resident, but apart from the fact that such a construction would, on the grammar of it, be untenable, :it is impossible to conceive how an arrangement relating to the conduct of business can, as such, be the subject-matter of income-tax, apart from the business in which profits or gains are made. The language of the section is clear beyond all reasonable doubt as to what it is that is sought to be taxed under this section. That is only the business of the resident and not that of the nonresident. In this view, it is only necessary to consider whether there is anything in the wording of the other parts of s. 42 (2) relied on for the appellant, which precludes us from giving effect to the plain import of the word "
It is on the expression "profits derived" in the charging part of the enactment that the appellant leans heavily in support of his position that it is the business of the non- resident that is really intended to be taxed. But then, those words do not stand alone. They are associated with the words " or which may reasonably be deemed to have been derived ", and this association has its origin in the preceding clause produces to the resident either no profits or less than the ordinary profits which might be expected to arise in that business ". This clause contemplates two classes of cases, one where the business of the resident produces no profits and the other where it produces less than the normal profits. The charge is imposed on both these classes of cases, and the word " derived " has reference to the latter, while the words " profits which may reasonably be deemed to have been derived " relate to the former. That both these clauses relate to the business of the resident is clear from the words " to the resident "
or " would have to be read in the context as meaning " and ". Vide Maxwell's Interpretation of Statutes, Tenth Edn. pp. 238-239. But that, however, does not affect the present question which is whether the word " derived " indubitably points to the business of the nonresident as the one taxable under s. 42 (2), and for the reasons already given, the answer must be in the negative.
42(2) which is wedged in between them should therefore be interpreted as having reference to the profits of the non-resident. If the language of s. 42(2) is clear that it is the resident who is chargeable to tax, it is of no consequence that under s. 42, sub-ss. (1) and (3) it is the non-resident that is taxed. It should be remembered that s. 42 occurs in Ch. V headed "	Section

H. N. Sanyal, Additional Solicitor-General of India, G. N. Joshi and R. H. Dhebar, for the respondent. 1958. May 12. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMA AIYAR J.-This is an appeal against the judgment of the High Court of Bombay in a reference under s. 66(1) of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, hereinafter referred to as the Act.
The appellant is a private limited company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, and is carrying on business as marine engineers and ship repairers. Its registered office is in Bombay and it is resident and ordinarily resident in India. Its entire share capital is beneficially owned by two British companies, the P. & 0. Steam Navigation Co.

On the basis of the above findings, orders of assessment of income-tax were made for the account years 1944-1945 and 1945-1946 and of excess profits tax for the account years 1943-1944, 1944-1945 and 1945-1946.
