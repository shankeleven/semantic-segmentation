Civil Appeals Nos. 132, 133 and 137 of 1955 BHAGWATI J.-These 3 appeals with certificate under article 132(1) of the Constitution involve the interpretation of the proviso to article 286(2) and raise a common question as to whether that proviso also saves the transactions of sale or purchase covered by the Explanation to article 286(1) (a) from the ban imposed therein.	Issue
The Appellants in Civil Appeal No. 132 of 1955 are Messrs Ramnarain Sons Ltd., a firm registered as a As. "dealer" under the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947, and carrying on business at Amravati and at other places in Madhya Pradesh. After the Cotton Control Order, 1949, came into force on the 12th September, 1949, the Appellants entered into agreements with several mills situated outside Madhya Pradesh by which they undertook to purchase kapas in the various markets in Madhya Pradesh as their agents on their account and on their behalf The kapas after purchase was to be ginned and pressed into bales and sent to the mills. All the expenses involved in the process were to be borne by the mills which were also to be credited with the sale proceeds of the cotton seeds and the Appellants were only entitled to commission on a percentage basis. The Ap- pellants worked as such agents for the period 1st October, 1949 to 30th September, 1950. By his order dated the 30th June, 1953 the Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax, Amravati, Respondent No. 1, included the transactions valued at Rs. 72,86,454-5-10 with the said- mills in the Appellants' turnover and ordered the Appellants to pay Rs. 1,13,850-13-6 as sales tax on the said transactions. The Appellants filed an appeal to the Commissioner of Sales Tax, Madhya Pradesh, Respondent No. 2, on the 30th July, 1953. The appeal was, however, entertained by the Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax, Madhya Pradesh, Respondent No. 3, who ordered the Appellants to pay Rs. 25,000/- by the 31st August., 1953. The Appellants thereupon filed a petition under Article 226, being Misc. Petition No. 265 of 1953, in the High Court of Judicature at Nagpur, asking inter alia for the quashing of the order of 30th June, 1953, passed by Respondent No. I and for consequential reliefs. The Respondents filed a return denying the contentions of the Appellants and praying for the dismissal of the petition with costs.
The Appellants in Civil Appeal No. 133 of 1955 are the Eastern Cotton Company, a firm registered as a "dealer" under the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947, and carrying on business at Amravati and at other places in Madhya Pradesh. They also, during the period 1st October, 1949 to 30th September, 1950, worked as agents of certain mills situated outside Madhya Pradesh, procured kapas for them in Madhya Pradesh and sent it to the mills for consumption outside the State. By his order dated the 9th September, 1953, the Respondent No. I included the transactions valued at Rs. 33,47,405-5-6 with the said mills in the Appellants' turn-over and ordered the Appellants to pay Rs. 52,303-4-0 as tax on the said transactions. These Appellants also filed a petition under article 226, being Misc. Petition No. 348 of 1953, in the High Court of Judicature at Nagpur for quashing the order dated the 9th September, 1953, passed by Respondent No. 1 and for con- sequential reliefs. The Respondents filed a return denying their contentions.
The Appellants in Civil Appeal No. 137 of 1955 are the firm, Ramdas Khimji Brothers, Bombay, registered as a "dealer" under the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act., 1947 and carrying on business as cotton dealers in Madhya Pradesh. During the period 1st October, 1950 to 30th September, 1951, the Appellants sold cotton worth Rs. 6,01,949-1-9 to various persons outside Madhya Pradesh. The cotton was delivered to the buyers for consumption outside Madhya Pradesh as a direct result of such sales. By his order dated the 29th December, 1952, the Sales Tax Officer, Amravati, in the assessment of the Appellants for the same period, included the said transactions in the Appellants' turn-over and assessed sales tax thereon. The Appellants filed an appeal to Respondent No. I but the same was dismissed by an order dated the 10th July, 1953. The Appellants filed on 22nd August, 1953, a revision before the Commissioner of Sales Tax, Madhya Pradesh. The Appellants also filed a petition under Article 226, being Misc. Petition No. 274 of 1953, in the High Court of Judicature at Nagpur, asking for a writ of certiorari quashing the order of Respondent No. I passed by him in Sales Tax Appeal No. 13-A dated the 10th July, 1953, and for consequential reliefs. The Respondents filed a return denying the contentions of the Appellants and A asking that the petition be dismissed with costs.
BHAGWATI J.-This petition under article 32 of the Constitution also involves the interpretation of the proviso to article 286(2) and raises the same question as to the meaning, scope and operation of the proviso as was raised in the Civil Appeals Nos. 132, 133 and 137 of 1955 just disposed of The facts giving rise to this Petition may be shortly stated. The petitioners are a partnership firm carrying on business of manufacturing bidis at Jabalpur and registered as a "dealer" under the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947. The petitioners had their branches at Lucknow, Kanpur, Faizabad, Agra, Bombay and Bhopal. They had also their selling agents at various places in Uttar Pradesh and elsewhere outside the Stae of Madhya Pradesh. They also entered into transactions direct with merchants in Uttar Pradesh. The transactions in. question which were the subject-matter of assessment at the instance of the Sales Tax authorities were for the period of assessment 21st October, 1949 to 9th November, 1950., and spread over two periods, viz., (1) the period between 21st October, 1949 to 25th January, 1950, which may be called the pre-Constitution period, and (2) the period subsequent to the inauguration of the Constitution on the 26th January, 1950, up to the 9th November., 1950, which may be called the postConstitution period. The petitioners' gross turn-over was determined to be Rs. 49,40,140-6-9 and the amount of Sales Tax assessed on the transactions was Rs. 1,51,291-13-0 as per the order of the Deputy Commissioner, Sales Tax, Madhya Pradesh, Respondent No. 3, dated the 14th July, 1954, in Sales Tax Appeal No. 6/A-1.6.54. The petitioners preferred_a second appeal to the Respondent No. 2 against the said order. The Respondent No. 2, however, refused to admit or register the appeal unless the amount of tax assessed was paid up. The petitioners paid about Rs. 91,000/- towards the amount of tax assessed but finding it difficult to pay the balance filed this Petition against the State of Madhya Pradesh, Respondent No, 1, the Commissioner of Sales Tax, Madhya Pradesh, Respondent No. 2, and the Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax, Madhya Pradesh, Respondent No. 3, for a writ of certiorari quashing the said order dated the 14th July, 1954, made by Respondent No. 3 and for consequential reliefs. The Respondents filed a return denying the contentions of the petitioners and maintaining that the Sales Tax was lawfully assessed by them against the petitioners.
contended before either of them that the sales were purely "inside sales" and that the Explanation to article 286(1)(a) did not come into play at all under the circumstances of the case. The facts as found by the Sales Tax authorities also emphasized that these transactions fell within the definition of sale contained in the Explanation 11 to section 2(g) of the Act and that so far as the post- Constitution period was concerned they were saved from the ban of article 286 (1) (a) and the Explanation thereto by the President's order made under the proviso to article 286(2). It was, however, urged by the learned Advocate- General of Madhya Pradesh that the transactions were pure "inside sales" entered into by the petitioners in Madhya Pradesh on orders received by them from outside the State. These orders were accepted by the petitioners in the State of Madhya Pradesh and goods were appropriated to the contracts and the property in the goods passed within the State of Madhya Pradesh and that, therefore, they were pure intraState sales or "inside sales" which it was within the competence of the State of Madhya Pradesh to tax. This contention of the learned Advocate-General of Madhya Pradesh is untenable. So far as direct supplies to selling agents on orders and direct supplies to merchants on orders covered by items (a) and (b) above are concerned, it was found that these supplies were made to the merchants buying the goods on commission basis or profit on their previous orders, instructions or indents which were either in printed forms or in ordinary letters and the sale prices were realised by sending bills and railway receipts through some scheduled banks. The very fact that the bills and the railway receipts were sent through the scheduled banks went to show that the petitioners reserved the right of disposal of goods covered by those railway receipts and the property in the goods passed in the State of Uttar Pradesh only after the relative bills were either accepted or honoured by the purchasers and the railway receipts delivered by the scheduled banks to them. It is clear, therefore, that in those cases the sales were completed in the State of Uttar Pradesh and were not intra-State sales or "inside sales" qua the State of Madhya Pradesh. As regards the direct supplies to destinations other than branches or depots but accounted for against the branches or depots being item (c) above, it was found that the petitioners despatched the goods and billed them to depot managers who were responsible for the collection of the orders and then the railway receipts and bills were sent there. The managers prepared other bills adding incidental or other charges and delivered the railway receipts to the customers to whom the goods were sent from the State of Madhya Pradesh. Here also the despatches of the goods were made from the State of Madhya Pradesh by the petitioners to their depot managers and it was the depot managers who in their turn prepared and submitted their own bills and handed over the railway receipts to the respective customers appropriating the goods themselves to the contracts of sale which had been entered into by them with the latter and completing the sales in the State of Uttar Pradesh. These transactions also were, therefore, sales effected in the State of Uttar Pradesh and did not fall within the category of intra-state sales or "inside sales" qua the State of Madhya Pradesh.

It was, however, urged on behalf of the State of Madhya Pradesh that the President's order not only saved the transactions from the ban of article 286(2) but also from the ban of article 286 (1) (a), because the transactions covered by the Explanation to article 286(1)(a) were of the same category as transactions covered by article 286(2) and were all in the course of inter-State trade or commerce. It was further urged that if the transactions covered by the Expla nation to article 286 (1)	PetArg
The Appellants contended that this Explanation offended article 286(1) (a) read with the Explanation to the same and the State of Madhya Pradesh was, therefore, not entitled to tax the transactions of sale in which goods had actually been delivered as a direct result of such sale for the purpose of consumption outside Madhya Pradesh. The Respondents, on the other hand, contended that the said Explanation was protected until the 31st March, 1951, by the Sales Tax Continuation Order No. 7 of 1950 issued by the President on' the 26th January, 1950, under the proviso to article 286(2).
The learned Attorney-General appearing for the Appellants before us contended that so far as the post-Constitution period is concerned, the position is governed by our judgment in The Bengal Immunity Co. Ltd. v. The State of Bihar delivered on the 6th September, 1955. He urged that the bans imposed on the powers of the State Legislatures to levy taxes on the sale or purchase of goods in the several clauses of article 286 are independent and separate and that the transactions of sale or purchase referred to in the various clauses must be looked at from different viewpoints. Even if a transaction might fall within the category of inter-State sale or purchase and the President's order under the proviso to article 286(2) might enable the State to levy any tax on such sale or purchase which was being lawfully levied by the State immediately before the commencement of the Constitution, such transaction had also to surmount the ban imposed under article 286(1) (a) and the Explanation thereto so that, if, as a direct result of such sale, the goods were actually delivered for the purpose of consumption in another State, the exporting State ,(to use the phraseology of the Nagpur High Court) or the title-State (to use the phraseology adopted in some of the judgments in The Bengal Immunity Co.'s Appeal) would not be entitled to levy a tax on such sale the transaction being fictionally outside the State by reason of the Explanation and therefore coming within the ban of article 286(1)(a).
The learned Attorney-General who appeared for the petitioners contended that the bidis manufactured by the petitioners were all actually delivered as a direct result of the transactions of sale for the purpose of consumption in the State of Uttar Pradesh and that after the inauguration of the Constitution on the 26th January, 1950, it was only the State of Uttar Pradesh which was the delivery State that alone had the right to impose the tax on these transactions notwithstanding the fact that under the general law relating to the sale of goods the property in the goods might have passed in the State of Madhya Pradesh. He, therefore, urged that these transactions were sales outside the State of Madhya Pradesh and that the State of Madhya Pradesh was not entitled to impose a tax on such sales.
The learned Advocate-General of Madhya Pradesh on the other hand contended that these were purely intra-state transactions entered into by the petitioners within the State of Madhya Pradesh and that the Explanation to article 286(1)(a) did not come into play at all because the goods were not actually delivered as a direct result of such sales for the purpose of consumption in the State of Uttar Pradesh. He, therefore, maintained that even for the post- Constitution period there was no ban on the State of Madhya Pradesh imposing the sales tax on what were purely "inside sales".
Apart from the ban imposed on the State of Madhya Pradesh under article 286(1) (a) and the Explanation thereto, these transactions were also in the course of inter-State trade or commerce and were hit by the ban of article 286(2). The President's order no doubt lifted that ban but was not competent to lift the ban under article 286 (1) (a) and the Explanation thereto with the result that in spite of that order the State of Madhya Pradesh was not in a position to impose a tax on these transactions during the post-Constitu- tion period.

1955. September 20. The judgment. of S. R. Das,. Acting Chief Justice, Bhagwati, Jafer Imam and Chandrasekhara Aiyar JJ. was delivered by Bhagwati J. Jagannadhadas J. delivered a separate judgment.
These petitions came up for hearing and final disposal before the High Court of Judicature at Nagpur along with Misc. Petitions No. 288 of 1953 and No. 132 of 1954. A considered judgment was delivered in Miscellaneous Petition No. 132 of 1954 and the reasoning contained therein governed the decision in the connected Petitions Nos. 265, 274 and 348 of 1953. The High Court held that the Explanation II to section 2(g) of the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947, as amended by the Central Provinces and Berar Act XVI of 1949 having been declared invalid from its inception by the High Court in Messrs Shriram Gulabdas v. Board of Revenue (I.L.R. 1953 Nagpur 332) and by this Court in 1954 S.C.R. 1122, the original Explanation remained in force until the 1st April, 1951, when it was amended by the Madhya Pradesh Act IV of 1951. Explanation II originally enacted was in the terms following:-
The High Court was of the opinion that the original Explanation was validly enacted as the assent of the Governor-General to the enactment was given on the 23rd May, 1,947, and that under that Explanation the tax prior to the commencement of the Constitution was lawfully levied on the sales of goods wherever the contracts of sale took place if the goods were actually in the State at the time the contracts of sale were made. This power could be exercised by the State even if the sales took place during the course of inter-State trade or commerce and the goods were delivered as a direct result of the sales for the purpose of consumption outside the State. This was because the situs of the goods constituted a sufficient nexus between the transactions and the taxing State which was the foundation for taxation prior to the commencement of the Constitution. This position continued until the com- mencement of the Constitution and on the 26th January, 1950, the President issued the Sales Tax Continuation Order No. 7 of 1950 in exercise of the powers conferred by the proviso to article 286(2). The sales in question had taken place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce and accordingly they were covered by article 286(2) and would, therefore, be liable to tax even after the commencement of the Constitution by virtue of the President's order. Reliance was further placed on the majority judgment of this Court in The State of Bombay v. The United Motors (India) Ltd. (1953 S.C.R. 1069) where it was held that the transaction vis-a- vis the delivery State lost its inter-State character if it fell within the Explanation to article 286(1) (a) and was accordingly made liable to taxation by the delivery State. So far, however, as the exporting State was concerned, it retained its character of an inter-State transaction and would not, therefore, be liable to taxation by that State, vide article 286(2). The President's order, however, removed this ban and. the exporting State was entitled to tax the transaction by virtue of the power derived by it from the same. On a construction of the relevant provisions of article 286(1) and article 286(2) the High Court was of the opinion that it would be making the proviso to article 286(2) nugatory if it was held that article 286(1) overrides it and takes away the taxing power of all States in inter-State trade or commerce except the delivery State. The High Court accordingly dismissed the petitions with costs.
The position as regards the petitioners' turn-over for the period of assessment was as stated below:-
sactions by virtue of the provisions of article 286(1) (a) and the Explanation thereto.
It is necessary in view of these rival contentions to ascertain the true nature of the transactions in question. In paragraph 15 of the Petition,, the petitioners had averred that the bidis manufactured by the firm were all delivered in the State of Uttar Pradesh for consumption in that State and that after the 26th January, 1950, the delivery State, viz., the State of Uttar Pradesh, had alone the right to impose tax on the sales of the commodity. They had further submitted that the State of Madhya Pradesh where the bidis were manufactured and from where they were sent could not any more exercise its right to levy a tax on such transactions of sale taking place elsewhere by reason of the inhibition contained in article 286. In the return filed by the Respondents, they did not deny the allegation made by the petitioners in their Petition that the bidis manufactured by the firm were all delivered,-in the State of 'Uttar Pradesh for consumption in that State. In substance, they contended that in spite of the State of Uttar Pradesh being the delivery State within the meaning of the Explanation to article 286 (1) (a), the liability of these transactions to sales tax at the instance of the State of Madhya Pradesh was saved by the President's order made under the proviso to article 286(2) and that the imposition of such tax at the instance of the State of Madhya Pradesh was lawful and did not contravene the provisions of article 286(1)(a) read with the Explanation thereto. Both the order which was made by the Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax, Jabalpur, in the original assessment case No. 16 of 1950-51, dated the 7th August, 1953, and the order which was made in Sales Tax Appeal No. 6/A-1.6.54 by the Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax, Madhya Pradesh, Respondent No. 3, dated the 14th July, 1954, proceeded on the basis that even though the transactions in question were transactions of sale where the goods had actually been delivered as a direct result of such sales for the purpose of consumption in the State of Uttar Pradesh, the President's order made under the proviso to article 286 (2) saved the transactions also from the ban of article 286(1) (a) and the Explanation thereto and that the State of Madhya Pradesh was, therefore, entitled to impose a tax on the same. It was never.
The direct supplies to Stations or destinations having branches or depots owned by the proprietors of the firm, Kanpur, Bombay, Lucknow and Faizabad being item (d) above, also were outside sales qua the State of Madhya Pradesh inasmuch as the branch managers asked the petitioners to send stocks of goods to execute the orders which they had obtained from the customers to make their own supplies to them. As a matter of fact it was found that several consolidated indents were placed by the depot managers with the petitioners in respect of the previous orders which had been collected by them and the petitioners supplied the goods to the depots or branches in pursuance of such indents. If this was the true position qua these supplies, these sales also were completed in the State of Uttar Pradesh by the depots or branches supplying the goods in their turn to several customers. There could be no sales as such between the petitioners on the one hand and their depots or branches on the other hand and the State of Madhya Pradesh could certainly not be at all in a position to tax the same.
The whole theory, therefore, of "inside sales" falls to the ground and the only thing which we are left with is-that these transactions were inter-State transactions in which as a direct result of such sales the goods were actually delivered for the purpose of consumption in the State of Uttar Pradesh. The Explanation to article 286(1)(a) determined the State of Uttar Pradesh to be the State in which the sales took place and which alone was entitled to tax these transactions, the State of Madhya Pradesh becoming an "outside" State for the purpose.
JAGANNADHADAS J.-I regret I feel constrained to differ from the view taken by my learned brothers as regards the construction of proviso to article 286(2) and the effect of the Presidential order issued there, under. There is no dispute that the proviso has to be construed as part of article 286(2). It is meant to empower the President to keep the ban arising thereunder in temporary abeyance so that the States may continue to levy taxes on sales by virtue of their preConstitution sales-tax laws (if then lawful) for a limited period. It is urged, however, that the proviso (meaning thereby also the Presidential order thereunder) is effective to lift only the ban under article 286(2) and that the ban under article 286(1)(a) is operative nonetheless. Now, it may be correct to say that these two bans are imposed from different angles and are in that sense independent. But there can be no doubt that they are substantially overlapping in operation. A transaction which brings about an outside sale is also an inter-State transaction (barring, if at all, a few ingeniously conceived and illustrated cases). The effect of each of the bans under article 286 is to demarcate the fields within which the taxing power of the States on sales cannot operate. If, as I conceive, the two bans under articles 286(1) (a) and 286(2), are overlapping, the fact that they are imposed from different angles cannot obscure the result, viz., that they bring about the demarcation of the same-or substantially the same-field of no taxation. It appears to me that it is in this light that the proviso and the Presidential order issued thereunder have to be construed. Now, the proviso (with the Presidential order) declares the field covered by sales in the course of inter-State trade and commerce as taxable for a limited period by stating positively and emphatically that "any tax on the sale or purchase of goods which was being lawfully levied by the Government of any State, immediately before the commencement of the Constitution. shall continue to be levied until the 31st day of March, 1951". There is no doubt the non-obstante clause which will be dealt with presently, and which only emphasises the fact that this is a proviso to article 286(2). But there is no mistaking the positive and mandatory terms of the proviso. The effect of this is clearly and unequivocally to make the whole field of inter-State trade and commerce temporarily taxable in respect of the sales which take place in the course thereof.
A similar situation as that contemplated by the proviso would also arise with reference to the saving clause in article 286(2). If the proviso is to be construed in the way suggested by the learned AttorneyGeneral, it would seem to follow that when and as the Parliament lifts the ban under article 286(2), the lifting of that ban would equally become futile by virtue of article 286(1)(a). The Parliament has not in terms Veen given the power to lift the latter ban. This, therefore, will lead to the extraordinary result that though the Constitution has in terms provided that the ban on taxation of sales in the course of inter- State trade and commerce can be lifted, by the Parliament generally, and by the President for a limited period, the exercise of both these powers would become ineffective and still-born by virtue of article 286(1)(a). It appears to me unreasonable to impute any such intention as inevitably arising from the language used. It appears to me, with great respect, that, whether it is by parliamentary legislation or by the Presidential action that the ban on taxing sales in the course of inter-State trade and commerce is lifted, the principle of harmonious construction of article 286 taken as an integral whole, requires that the lifting of the ban is to be construed as laying open for taxation the entire field covered by article 286(2) and to carry with it the implication that no other overlapping ban will be operative. No doubt, it has been suggested that so far as lifting of the ban under article 286(2) by the Parliament is concerned, the same would be at least partly operative by virtue of article 286(1) (a) taken with the Explanation under which the consumption-delivery State may well be free to tax. This was the view expressed by the learned dissenting Judge in the case in The State of Bombay v. The United Motors (India) Ltd.(1). But the majority in the recent decision in the Bengal Immunity Co. Ltd. v. State of Bihar(2) including the said learned Judge, have left that question open. It is problematical whether having regard to the inevitable extra-territorial operation of the levy of such a tax and the consequent harassment to the business community which looms large, the Explanation will receive that construction again and not receive the strict construction preferred in the dissenting judgment in the case in State of Travancore-Cochin v. Shanmugha Vilas Cashew Nut Factory(3). The result, therefore, of construing the proviso and by parity of reasoning the saving clause, as merely removing the ban of a particular nature leaving another overlapping ban to operate, would be to render both the saving clause in, and the proviso to, article 286(2) virtually nugatory.	Precedent
tions Nos. 265, 348 and 275 of 1953 respectively and Petition under Article 32 of the Constitution for the enforcement of fundamental rights.
(a) were not saved from the ban by the President's order, the whole intention of the Constitution-makers in maintaining the status quo qua the taxes on sales or purchases of goods which were being lawfully levied by the State immediately before the commencement of the Constitu- tion would be frustrated, because the transactions covered by the Explanation to article 286(1) (a) being necessarily in the course of inter-State trade or commerce the President's order would be rendered nugatory and the exporting State or the title State would' be- restrained from levying tax on such transactions in spite of the ban having been lifted by the President's order. We are unable to accept this contention. As held by the majority Judges in The Bengal Immunity Co.'s Appeal, the bans imposed by article 286 on the taxing powers of the States are independent and separate and each one of them has to be got over before a State Legislature can impose tax on transactions of sale or purchase of goods. These bans have been imposed from different view-points, and, even though the transactions of sale or purchase may in conceivable cases overlap so far as these different viewpoints are concerned, each of those bans is operative and has to be enforced. So far as article 286(1) (a) is concerned, the Explanation determines by the legal fiction created therein the situs of the sale in the case of transactions coming within that category and when a transaction is thus determined to be inside a particular State it necessarily becomes a transaction outside all other States. The only relevant enquiry for the purposes of article 286(1) (a), therefore, is whether a transaction is outside the State and once it is determined by the application of the Explanation that it is outside the State it follows as a matter of course that the State with reference to which the transac- tion can thus be predicated to be outside it can never tax the transaction. This ban is effective independently of the fact that the, transaction may also have taken place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce or with reference to goods as have been declared by Parliament by law to be essential for the life of the community. The ban imposed under article 286(2) is an independent and separate one and looks at the transactions entirely from the point of view of their having taken place in the course of inter- State trade or commerce. Even if such transactions may also fall within the category of transactions covered by article 286 (1)(a) and the Explanation thereto or article 286(3), the moment article 286(2) is attracted by reason of the transactions being in the course of interState trade or commerce, the ban under article 286 (2) operates and such transactions can never be subjected to tax at the instance of a State Legislature except in so far as Parliament by law may otherwise provide or such power of taxation is saved by the President's order contemplated in the proviso. The ban under article 286(2) may be saved by the President's order but that does not affect or lift the ban under article 286 (1 (a) read with the Explanation.
Apart from the construction thus, put upon the several clauses of article 286 by the majority of the Judges in The Bengal Immunity Co.'s Appeal as above, the terms of the proviso itself make it abundantly clear that the proviso is meant only to lift the ban under article 286 (2) and no other. It is a cardinal rule of interpretation that a proviso to a particular provision of a statute only embraces the field which is covered by the main -provision. It carves out an exception to the main provision to which it has been enacted as' a proviso and to no other. Even if the non' obstante clause: "Notwithstanding that the imposition of such tax is contrary to the provisions of this clause":
-If this be so, it appears to me to be implicit therein that no other ban on such taxation can operate, for the time being, within that very field. To construe the two bans as independently and cumulatively operative is to impute to them some kind of Picturesque potency and is to miss the reality, viz., that all the bans under article 286 are meant to serve the same purpose, viz., that of imposing restrictions and thereby demarcating the fields of no taxation. The bans and the proviso are parts of the same article and have to be harmoniously construed. The un- equivocal and positive language of one part, cannot be taken to have been obliterated by the negative language of the other part so as to rsult in futility.
The argument based on the non-obstante clause in the proviso, viz. "Notwithstanding that the imposition of such tax is contrary to the provisions of this clause" remains to be considered. It is urged that this clause clearly indicates the intention that the operation of the proviso is to be confined to the sole purpose of lifting the ban arising under article 286(2). With respect, I am unable to agree. The non-obstante clause undoubtedly affirms the fact that the 'proviso is operative in respect of article 286(2). But it does not purport to limit the effect of the proviso, which a reasonable construction thereof may justify. A non- obstante clause does not normally add to or subtract from the main provision of which it is a part. It is often enough inserted by way of extra caution. But it does not have the effect of limiting the operation of the main provision. (See Aswini Kumar Ghosh v. Arabinda Bose(1) and The Dominion of India v. Shrinbai A. Irani(2)). The suggestion that the Presidential action lifts the ban only as regards the inter-State sales would be to read the phrase "notwithstanding that" as meaning "in so far as". I can see no warrant for any such reading.	Section
It was, therefore, urged that on the facts of this case the assessment was invalid in toto and that it should be set aside. The learned Deputy Advocate-General of Madhya Pradesh did not seriously contest this position and the result, therefore, is that the order of assessment dated the 30th June, 1953, in Civil Appeal No. 132 of 1955 and the order of assessment dated the 9th September, 1953, in Civil Appeal No. 133 of 1955 are liable to be set aside. The appeals will therefore be allowed, the orders of assessment will be set aside and the matters will go back to the Assessment Officer for re- assessment of the Appellants in accordance with law. The Appellants will be at liberty to urge before the Assessment Officer the-contentions -of law and fact available to them in the fresh assessment proceedings including those adverted to above. The Respondents will pay the costs of these Appellants here as well as in the Court below.
Petition No. 567 of 1954.
The assessment of these transactions to tax for the post- Constitution period, therefore, is invalid and cannot be sustained. The assessment, moreover, is a composite one covering the pre-Constitution period as well. The case, therefore, falls within our judgment in Civil Appeals Nos. 132, 133 and 137 of 1955 just delivered, and following the reasoning contained therein, we are of the opinion that the order dated the 14th July, 1954, made by the Deputy Commissioner, Sales Tax, Madhya Pradesh, Respondent No. 3, in Sales Tax Appeal No. 6/A- 1.6.54 should be set aside. We accordingly allow the Petition, set aside the said order dated the 14th July, 1954, and the matter will go back to the Assessment Officer for re-assessment of the petitioners in accordance with law. The petitioners will be at liberty to urge before the Assessment Officer the contentions of law and fact available to them in the fresh assessment proceedings. The Respondents will pay the costs of the petition.

In my view, therefore, the pre-Constitution salestax laws, if then lawful, are not hit by article 286(1) (a)-at least to the extent that the ban under article 286(1) (a) overlaps with that under article 286(2). 'In this 'view, the orders of assessment in these cases cannot be set aside and the validity of the relevant preConstitution laws will have to be considered and the further facts gone into. But it is now not necessary to do so in these cases in the view taken by my learned brothers and the order proposed by them will govern these cases.

1955. September 20. The judgment. of S. R. Das,. Acting Chief Justice, Bhagwati, Jafer Imam and Chandrasekhara Aiyar JJ. was delivered by Bhagwati J. Jagannadhadas J. delivered a separate judgment.
Civil Appeals Nos. 132, 133 and 137 of 1955 BHAGWATI J.-These 3 appeals with certificate under article 132(1) of the Constitution involve the interpretation of the proviso to article 286(2) and raise a common question as to whether that proviso also saves the transactions of sale or purchase covered by the Explanation to article 286(1) (a) from the ban imposed therein.
The Appellants in Civil Appeal No. 132 of 1955 are Messrs Ramnarain Sons Ltd., a firm registered as a As. "dealer" under the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947, and carrying on business at Amravati and at other places in Madhya Pradesh. After the Cotton Control Order, 1949, came into force on the 12th September, 1949, the Appellants entered into agreements with several mills situated outside Madhya Pradesh by which they undertook to purchase kapas in the various markets in Madhya Pradesh as their agents on their account and on their behalf The kapas after purchase was to be ginned and pressed into bales and sent to the mills. All the expenses involved in the process were to be borne by the mills which were also to be credited with the sale proceeds of the cotton seeds and the Appellants were only entitled to commission on a percentage basis. The Ap- pellants worked as such agents for the period 1st October, 1949 to 30th September, 1950. By his order dated the 30th June, 1953 the Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax, Amravati, Respondent No. 1, included the transactions valued at Rs. 72,86,454-5-10 with the said- mills in the Appellants' turnover and ordered the Appellants to pay Rs. 1,13,850-13-6 as sales tax on the said transactions. The Appellants filed an appeal to the Commissioner of Sales Tax, Madhya Pradesh, Respondent No. 2, on the 30th July, 1953. The appeal was, however, entertained by the Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax, Madhya Pradesh, Respondent No. 3, who ordered the Appellants to pay Rs. 25,000/- by the 31st August., 1953. The Appellants thereupon filed a petition under Article 226, being Misc. Petition No. 265 of 1953, in the High Court of Judicature at Nagpur, asking inter alia for the quashing of the order of 30th June, 1953, passed by Respondent No. I and for consequential reliefs. The Respondents filed a return denying the contentions of the Appellants and praying for the dismissal of the petition with costs.
The Appellants in Civil Appeal No. 133 of 1955 are the Eastern Cotton Company, a firm registered as a "dealer" under the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947, and carrying on business at Amravati and at other places in Madhya Pradesh. They also, during the period 1st October, 1949 to 30th September, 1950, worked as agents of certain mills situated outside Madhya Pradesh, procured kapas for them in Madhya Pradesh and sent it to the mills for consumption outside the State. By his order dated the 9th September, 1953, the Respondent No. I included the transactions valued at Rs. 33,47,405-5-6 with the said mills in the Appellants' turn-over and ordered the Appellants to pay Rs. 52,303-4-0 as tax on the said transactions. These Appellants also filed a petition under article 226, being Misc. Petition No. 348 of 1953, in the High Court of Judicature at Nagpur for quashing the order dated the 9th September, 1953, passed by Respondent No. 1 and for con- sequential reliefs. The Respondents filed a return denying their contentions.
The Appellants in Civil Appeal No. 137 of 1955 are the firm, Ramdas Khimji Brothers, Bombay, registered as a "dealer" under the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act., 1947 and carrying on business as cotton dealers in Madhya Pradesh. During the period 1st October, 1950 to 30th September, 1951, the Appellants sold cotton worth Rs. 6,01,949-1-9 to various persons outside Madhya Pradesh. The cotton was delivered to the buyers for consumption outside Madhya Pradesh as a direct result of such sales. By his order dated the 29th December, 1952, the Sales Tax Officer, Amravati, in the assessment of the Appellants for the same period, included the said transactions in the Appellants' turn-over and assessed sales tax thereon. The Appellants filed an appeal to Respondent No. I but the same was dismissed by an order dated the 10th July, 1953. The Appellants filed on 22nd August, 1953, a revision before the Commissioner of Sales Tax, Madhya Pradesh. The Appellants also filed a petition under Article 226, being Misc. Petition No. 274 of 1953, in the High Court of Judicature at Nagpur, asking for a writ of certiorari quashing the order of Respondent No. I passed by him in Sales Tax Appeal No. 13-A dated the 10th July, 1953, and for consequential reliefs. The Respondents filed a return denying the contentions of the Appellants and A asking that the petition be dismissed with costs.
These petitions came up for hearing and final disposal before the High Court of Judicature at Nagpur along with Misc. Petitions No. 288 of 1953 and No. 132 of 1954. A considered judgment was delivered in Miscellaneous Petition No. 132 of 1954 and the reasoning contained therein governed the decision in the connected Petitions Nos. 265, 274 and 348 of 1953. The High Court held that the Explanation II to section 2(g) of the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947, as amended by the Central Provinces and Berar Act XVI of 1949 having been declared invalid from its inception by the High Court in Messrs Shriram Gulabdas v. Board of Revenue (I.L.R. 1953 Nagpur 332) and by this Court in 1954 S.C.R. 1122, the original Explanation remained in force until the 1st April, 1951, when it was amended by the Madhya Pradesh Act IV of 1951. Explanation II originally enacted was in the terms following:-
The Appellants contended that this Explanation offended article 286(1) (a) read with the Explanation to the same and the State of Madhya Pradesh was, therefore, not entitled to tax the transactions of sale in which goods had actually been delivered as a direct result of such sale for the purpose of consumption outside Madhya Pradesh. The Respondents, on the other hand, contended that the said Explanation was protected until the 31st March, 1951, by the Sales Tax Continuation Order No. 7 of 1950 issued by the President on' the 26th January, 1950, under the proviso to article 286(2).
The High Court was of the opinion that the original Explanation was validly enacted as the assent of the Governor-General to the enactment was given on the 23rd May, 1,947, and that under that Explanation the tax prior to the commencement of the Constitution was lawfully levied on the sales of goods wherever the contracts of sale took place if the goods were actually in the State at the time the contracts of sale were made. This power could be exercised by the State even if the sales took place during the course of inter-State trade or commerce and the goods were delivered as a direct result of the sales for the purpose of consumption outside the State. This was because the situs of the goods constituted a sufficient nexus between the transactions and the taxing State which was the foundation for taxation prior to the commencement of the Constitution. This position continued until the com- mencement of the Constitution and on the 26th January, 1950, the President issued the Sales Tax Continuation Order No. 7 of 1950 in exercise of the powers conferred by the proviso to article 286(2). The sales in question had taken place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce and accordingly they were covered by article 286(2) and would, therefore, be liable to tax even after the commencement of the Constitution by virtue of the President's order. Reliance was further placed on the majority judgment of this Court in The State of Bombay v. The United Motors (India) Ltd. (1953 S.C.R. 1069) where it was held that the transaction vis-a- vis the delivery State lost its inter-State character if it fell within the Explanation to article 286(1) (a) and was accordingly made liable to taxation by the delivery State. So far, however, as the exporting State was concerned, it retained its character of an inter-State transaction and would not, therefore, be liable to taxation by that State, vide article 286(2). The President's order, however, removed this ban and. the exporting State was entitled to tax the transaction by virtue of the power derived by it from the same. On a construction of the relevant provisions of article 286(1) and article 286(2) the High Court was of the opinion that it would be making the proviso to article 286(2) nugatory if it was held that article 286(1) overrides it and takes away the taxing power of all States in inter-State trade or commerce except the delivery State. The High Court accordingly dismissed the petitions with costs.
The learned Attorney-General appearing for the Appellants before us contended that so far as the post-Constitution period is concerned, the position is governed by our judgment in The Bengal Immunity Co. Ltd. v. The State of Bihar delivered on the 6th September, 1955. He urged that the bans imposed on the powers of the State Legislatures to levy taxes on the sale or purchase of goods in the several clauses of article 286 are independent and separate and that the transactions of sale or purchase referred to in the various clauses must be looked at from different viewpoints. Even if a transaction might fall within the category of inter-State sale or purchase and the President's order under the proviso to article 286(2) might enable the State to levy any tax on such sale or purchase which was being lawfully levied by the State immediately before the commencement of the Constitution, such transaction had also to surmount the ban imposed under article 286(1) (a) and the Explanation thereto so that, if, as a direct result of such sale, the goods were actually delivered for the purpose of consumption in another State, the exporting State ,(to use the phraseology of the Nagpur High Court) or the title-State (to use the phraseology adopted in some of the judgments in The Bengal Immunity Co.'s Appeal) would not be entitled to levy a tax on such sale the transaction being fictionally outside the State by reason of the Explanation and therefore coming within the ban of article 286(1)(a).
It was, however, urged on behalf of the State of Madhya Pradesh that the President's order not only saved the transactions from the ban of article 286(2) but also from the ban of article 286 (1) (a), because the transactions covered by the Explanation to article 286(1)(a) were of the same category as transactions covered by article 286(2) and were all in the course of inter-State trade or commerce. It was further urged that if the transactions covered by the Expla nation to article 286 (1)
(a) were not saved from the ban by the President's order, the whole intention of the Constitution-makers in maintaining the status quo qua the taxes on sales or purchases of goods which were being lawfully levied by the State immediately before the commencement of the Constitu- tion would be frustrated, because the transactions covered by the Explanation to article 286(1) (a) being necessarily in the course of inter-State trade or commerce the President's order would be rendered nugatory and the exporting State or the title State would' be- restrained from levying tax on such transactions in spite of the ban having been lifted by the President's order. We are unable to accept this contention. As held by the majority Judges in The Bengal Immunity Co.'s Appeal, the bans imposed by article 286 on the taxing powers of the States are independent and separate and each one of them has to be got over before a State Legislature can impose tax on transactions of sale or purchase of goods. These bans have been imposed from different view-points, and, even though the transactions of sale or purchase may in conceivable cases overlap so far as these different viewpoints are concerned, each of those bans is operative and has to be enforced. So far as article 286(1) (a) is concerned, the Explanation determines by the legal fiction created therein the situs of the sale in the case of transactions coming within that category and when a transaction is thus determined to be inside a particular State it necessarily becomes a transaction outside all other States. The only relevant enquiry for the purposes of article 286(1) (a), therefore, is whether a transaction is outside the State and once it is determined by the application of the Explanation that it is outside the State it follows as a matter of course that the State with reference to which the transac- tion can thus be predicated to be outside it can never tax the transaction. This ban is effective independently of the fact that the, transaction may also have taken place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce or with reference to goods as have been declared by Parliament by law to be essential for the life of the community. The ban imposed under article 286(2) is an independent and separate one and looks at the transactions entirely from the point of view of their having taken place in the course of inter- State trade or commerce. Even if such transactions may also fall within the category of transactions covered by article 286 (1)(a) and the Explanation thereto or article 286(3), the moment article 286(2) is attracted by reason of the transactions being in the course of interState trade or commerce, the ban under article 286 (2) operates and such transactions can never be subjected to tax at the instance of a State Legislature except in so far as Parliament by law may otherwise provide or such power of taxation is saved by the President's order contemplated in the proviso. The ban under article 286(2) may be saved by the President's order but that does not affect or lift the ban under article 286 (1 (a) read with the Explanation.
Apart from the construction thus, put upon the several clauses of article 286 by the majority of the Judges in The Bengal Immunity Co.'s Appeal as above, the terms of the proviso itself make it abundantly clear that the proviso is meant only to lift the ban under article 286 (2) and no other. It is a cardinal rule of interpretation that a proviso to a particular provision of a statute only embraces the field which is covered by the main -provision. It carves out an exception to the main provision to which it has been enacted as' a proviso and to no other. Even if the non' obstante clause: "Notwithstanding that the imposition of such tax is contrary to the provisions of this clause":
It was, therefore, urged that on the facts of this case the assessment was invalid in toto and that it should be set aside. The learned Deputy Advocate-General of Madhya Pradesh did not seriously contest this position and the result, therefore, is that the order of assessment dated the 30th June, 1953, in Civil Appeal No. 132 of 1955 and the order of assessment dated the 9th September, 1953, in Civil Appeal No. 133 of 1955 are liable to be set aside. The appeals will therefore be allowed, the orders of assessment will be set aside and the matters will go back to the Assessment Officer for re- assessment of the Appellants in accordance with law. The Appellants will be at liberty to urge before the Assessment Officer the-contentions -of law and fact available to them in the fresh assessment proceedings including those adverted to above. The Respondents will pay the costs of these Appellants here as well as in the Court below.
Petition No. 567 of 1954.
BHAGWATI J.-This petition under article 32 of the Constitution also involves the interpretation of the proviso to article 286(2) and raises the same question as to the meaning, scope and operation of the proviso as was raised in the Civil Appeals Nos. 132, 133 and 137 of 1955 just disposed of The facts giving rise to this Petition may be shortly stated. The petitioners are a partnership firm carrying on business of manufacturing bidis at Jabalpur and registered as a "dealer" under the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947. The petitioners had their branches at Lucknow, Kanpur, Faizabad, Agra, Bombay and Bhopal. They had also their selling agents at various places in Uttar Pradesh and elsewhere outside the Stae of Madhya Pradesh. They also entered into transactions direct with merchants in Uttar Pradesh. The transactions in. question which were the subject-matter of assessment at the instance of the Sales Tax authorities were for the period of assessment 21st October, 1949 to 9th November, 1950., and spread over two periods, viz., (1) the period between 21st October, 1949 to 25th January, 1950, which may be called the pre-Constitution period, and (2) the period subsequent to the inauguration of the Constitution on the 26th January, 1950, up to the 9th November., 1950, which may be called the postConstitution period. The petitioners' gross turn-over was determined to be Rs. 49,40,140-6-9 and the amount of Sales Tax assessed on the transactions was Rs. 1,51,291-13-0 as per the order of the Deputy Commissioner, Sales Tax, Madhya Pradesh, Respondent No. 3, dated the 14th July, 1954, in Sales Tax Appeal No. 6/A-1.6.54. The petitioners preferred_a second appeal to the Respondent No. 2 against the said order. The Respondent No. 2, however, refused to admit or register the appeal unless the amount of tax assessed was paid up. The petitioners paid about Rs. 91,000/- towards the amount of tax assessed but finding it difficult to pay the balance filed this Petition against the State of Madhya Pradesh, Respondent No, 1, the Commissioner of Sales Tax, Madhya Pradesh, Respondent No. 2, and the Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax, Madhya Pradesh, Respondent No. 3, for a writ of certiorari quashing the said order dated the 14th July, 1954, made by Respondent No. 3 and for consequential reliefs. The Respondents filed a return denying the contentions of the petitioners and maintaining that the Sales Tax was lawfully assessed by them against the petitioners.
The position as regards the petitioners' turn-over for the period of assessment was as stated below:-
sactions by virtue of the provisions of article 286(1) (a) and the Explanation thereto.
The learned Attorney-General who appeared for the petitioners contended that the bidis manufactured by the petitioners were all actually delivered as a direct result of the transactions of sale for the purpose of consumption in the State of Uttar Pradesh and that after the inauguration of the Constitution on the 26th January, 1950, it was only the State of Uttar Pradesh which was the delivery State that alone had the right to impose the tax on these transactions notwithstanding the fact that under the general law relating to the sale of goods the property in the goods might have passed in the State of Madhya Pradesh. He, therefore, urged that these transactions were sales outside the State of Madhya Pradesh and that the State of Madhya Pradesh was not entitled to impose a tax on such sales.
The learned Advocate-General of Madhya Pradesh on the other hand contended that these were purely intra-state transactions entered into by the petitioners within the State of Madhya Pradesh and that the Explanation to article 286(1)(a) did not come into play at all because the goods were not actually delivered as a direct result of such sales for the purpose of consumption in the State of Uttar Pradesh. He, therefore, maintained that even for the post- Constitution period there was no ban on the State of Madhya Pradesh imposing the sales tax on what were purely "inside sales".
It is necessary in view of these rival contentions to ascertain the true nature of the transactions in question. In paragraph 15 of the Petition,, the petitioners had averred that the bidis manufactured by the firm were all delivered in the State of Uttar Pradesh for consumption in that State and that after the 26th January, 1950, the delivery State, viz., the State of Uttar Pradesh, had alone the right to impose tax on the sales of the commodity. They had further submitted that the State of Madhya Pradesh where the bidis were manufactured and from where they were sent could not any more exercise its right to levy a tax on such transactions of sale taking place elsewhere by reason of the inhibition contained in article 286. In the return filed by the Respondents, they did not deny the allegation made by the petitioners in their Petition that the bidis manufactured by the firm were all delivered,-in the State of 'Uttar Pradesh for consumption in that State. In substance, they contended that in spite of the State of Uttar Pradesh being the delivery State within the meaning of the Explanation to article 286 (1) (a), the liability of these transactions to sales tax at the instance of the State of Madhya Pradesh was saved by the President's order made under the proviso to article 286(2) and that the imposition of such tax at the instance of the State of Madhya Pradesh was lawful and did not contravene the provisions of article 286(1)(a) read with the Explanation thereto. Both the order which was made by the Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax, Jabalpur, in the original assessment case No. 16 of 1950-51, dated the 7th August, 1953, and the order which was made in Sales Tax Appeal No. 6/A-1.6.54 by the Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax, Madhya Pradesh, Respondent No. 3, dated the 14th July, 1954, proceeded on the basis that even though the transactions in question were transactions of sale where the goods had actually been delivered as a direct result of such sales for the purpose of consumption in the State of Uttar Pradesh, the President's order made under the proviso to article 286 (2) saved the transactions also from the ban of article 286(1) (a) and the Explanation thereto and that the State of Madhya Pradesh was, therefore, entitled to impose a tax on the same. It was never.
contended before either of them that the sales were purely "inside sales" and that the Explanation to article 286(1)(a) did not come into play at all under the circumstances of the case. The facts as found by the Sales Tax authorities also emphasized that these transactions fell within the definition of sale contained in the Explanation 11 to section 2(g) of the Act and that so far as the post- Constitution period was concerned they were saved from the ban of article 286 (1) (a) and the Explanation thereto by the President's order made under the proviso to article 286(2). It was, however, urged by the learned Advocate- General of Madhya Pradesh that the transactions were pure "inside sales" entered into by the petitioners in Madhya Pradesh on orders received by them from outside the State. These orders were accepted by the petitioners in the State of Madhya Pradesh and goods were appropriated to the contracts and the property in the goods passed within the State of Madhya Pradesh and that, therefore, they were pure intraState sales or "inside sales" which it was within the competence of the State of Madhya Pradesh to tax. This contention of the learned Advocate-General of Madhya Pradesh is untenable. So far as direct supplies to selling agents on orders and direct supplies to merchants on orders covered by items (a) and (b) above are concerned, it was found that these supplies were made to the merchants buying the goods on commission basis or profit on their previous orders, instructions or indents which were either in printed forms or in ordinary letters and the sale prices were realised by sending bills and railway receipts through some scheduled banks. The very fact that the bills and the railway receipts were sent through the scheduled banks went to show that the petitioners reserved the right of disposal of goods covered by those railway receipts and the property in the goods passed in the State of Uttar Pradesh only after the relative bills were either accepted or honoured by the purchasers and the railway receipts delivered by the scheduled banks to them. It is clear, therefore, that in those cases the sales were completed in the State of Uttar Pradesh and were not intra-State sales or "inside sales" qua the State of Madhya Pradesh. As regards the direct supplies to destinations other than branches or depots but accounted for against the branches or depots being item (c) above, it was found that the petitioners despatched the goods and billed them to depot managers who were responsible for the collection of the orders and then the railway receipts and bills were sent there. The managers prepared other bills adding incidental or other charges and delivered the railway receipts to the customers to whom the goods were sent from the State of Madhya Pradesh. Here also the despatches of the goods were made from the State of Madhya Pradesh by the petitioners to their depot managers and it was the depot managers who in their turn prepared and submitted their own bills and handed over the railway receipts to the respective customers appropriating the goods themselves to the contracts of sale which had been entered into by them with the latter and completing the sales in the State of Uttar Pradesh. These transactions also were, therefore, sales effected in the State of Uttar Pradesh and did not fall within the category of intra-state sales or "inside sales" qua the State of Madhya Pradesh.
The direct supplies to Stations or destinations having branches or depots owned by the proprietors of the firm, Kanpur, Bombay, Lucknow and Faizabad being item (d) above, also were outside sales qua the State of Madhya Pradesh inasmuch as the branch managers asked the petitioners to send stocks of goods to execute the orders which they had obtained from the customers to make their own supplies to them. As a matter of fact it was found that several consolidated indents were placed by the depot managers with the petitioners in respect of the previous orders which had been collected by them and the petitioners supplied the goods to the depots or branches in pursuance of such indents. If this was the true position qua these supplies, these sales also were completed in the State of Uttar Pradesh by the depots or branches supplying the goods in their turn to several customers. There could be no sales as such between the petitioners on the one hand and their depots or branches on the other hand and the State of Madhya Pradesh could certainly not be at all in a position to tax the same.
The whole theory, therefore, of "inside sales" falls to the ground and the only thing which we are left with is-that these transactions were inter-State transactions in which as a direct result of such sales the goods were actually delivered for the purpose of consumption in the State of Uttar Pradesh. The Explanation to article 286(1)(a) determined the State of Uttar Pradesh to be the State in which the sales took place and which alone was entitled to tax these transactions, the State of Madhya Pradesh becoming an "outside" State for the purpose.
Apart from the ban imposed on the State of Madhya Pradesh under article 286(1) (a) and the Explanation thereto, these transactions were also in the course of inter-State trade or commerce and were hit by the ban of article 286(2). The President's order no doubt lifted that ban but was not competent to lift the ban under article 286 (1) (a) and the Explanation thereto with the result that in spite of that order the State of Madhya Pradesh was not in a position to impose a tax on these transactions during the post-Constitu- tion period.
The assessment of these transactions to tax for the post- Constitution period, therefore, is invalid and cannot be sustained. The assessment, moreover, is a composite one covering the pre-Constitution period as well. The case, therefore, falls within our judgment in Civil Appeals Nos. 132, 133 and 137 of 1955 just delivered, and following the reasoning contained therein, we are of the opinion that the order dated the 14th July, 1954, made by the Deputy Commissioner, Sales Tax, Madhya Pradesh, Respondent No. 3, in Sales Tax Appeal No. 6/A- 1.6.54 should be set aside. We accordingly allow the Petition, set aside the said order dated the 14th July, 1954, and the matter will go back to the Assessment Officer for re-assessment of the petitioners in accordance with law. The petitioners will be at liberty to urge before the Assessment Officer the contentions of law and fact available to them in the fresh assessment proceedings. The Respondents will pay the costs of the petition.
JAGANNADHADAS J.-I regret I feel constrained to differ from the view taken by my learned brothers as regards the construction of proviso to article 286(2) and the effect of the Presidential order issued there, under. There is no dispute that the proviso has to be construed as part of article 286(2). It is meant to empower the President to keep the ban arising thereunder in temporary abeyance so that the States may continue to levy taxes on sales by virtue of their preConstitution sales-tax laws (if then lawful) for a limited period. It is urged, however, that the proviso (meaning thereby also the Presidential order thereunder) is effective to lift only the ban under article 286(2) and that the ban under article 286(1)(a) is operative nonetheless. Now, it may be correct to say that these two bans are imposed from different angles and are in that sense independent. But there can be no doubt that they are substantially overlapping in operation. A transaction which brings about an outside sale is also an inter-State transaction (barring, if at all, a few ingeniously conceived and illustrated cases). The effect of each of the bans under article 286 is to demarcate the fields within which the taxing power of the States on sales cannot operate. If, as I conceive, the two bans under articles 286(1) (a) and 286(2), are overlapping, the fact that they are imposed from different angles cannot obscure the result, viz., that they bring about the demarcation of the same-or substantially the same-field of no taxation. It appears to me that it is in this light that the proviso and the Presidential order issued thereunder have to be construed. Now, the proviso (with the Presidential order) declares the field covered by sales in the course of inter-State trade and commerce as taxable for a limited period by stating positively and emphatically that "any tax on the sale or purchase of goods which was being lawfully levied by the Government of any State, immediately before the commencement of the Constitution. shall continue to be levied until the 31st day of March, 1951". There is no doubt the non-obstante clause which will be dealt with presently, and which only emphasises the fact that this is a proviso to article 286(2). But there is no mistaking the positive and mandatory terms of the proviso. The effect of this is clearly and unequivocally to make the whole field of inter-State trade and commerce temporarily taxable in respect of the sales which take place in the course thereof.
-If this be so, it appears to me to be implicit therein that no other ban on such taxation can operate, for the time being, within that very field. To construe the two bans as independently and cumulatively operative is to impute to them some kind of Picturesque potency and is to miss the reality, viz., that all the bans under article 286 are meant to serve the same purpose, viz., that of imposing restrictions and thereby demarcating the fields of no taxation. The bans and the proviso are parts of the same article and have to be harmoniously construed. The un- equivocal and positive language of one part, cannot be taken to have been obliterated by the negative language of the other part so as to rsult in futility.
A similar situation as that contemplated by the proviso would also arise with reference to the saving clause in article 286(2). If the proviso is to be construed in the way suggested by the learned AttorneyGeneral, it would seem to follow that when and as the Parliament lifts the ban under article 286(2), the lifting of that ban would equally become futile by virtue of article 286(1)(a). The Parliament has not in terms Veen given the power to lift the latter ban. This, therefore, will lead to the extraordinary result that though the Constitution has in terms provided that the ban on taxation of sales in the course of inter- State trade and commerce can be lifted, by the Parliament generally, and by the President for a limited period, the exercise of both these powers would become ineffective and still-born by virtue of article 286(1)(a). It appears to me unreasonable to impute any such intention as inevitably arising from the language used. It appears to me, with great respect, that, whether it is by parliamentary legislation or by the Presidential action that the ban on taxing sales in the course of inter-State trade and commerce is lifted, the principle of harmonious construction of article 286 taken as an integral whole, requires that the lifting of the ban is to be construed as laying open for taxation the entire field covered by article 286(2) and to carry with it the implication that no other overlapping ban will be operative. No doubt, it has been suggested that so far as lifting of the ban under article 286(2) by the Parliament is concerned, the same would be at least partly operative by virtue of article 286(1) (a) taken with the Explanation under which the consumption-delivery State may well be free to tax. This was the view expressed by the learned dissenting Judge in the case in The State of Bombay v. The United Motors (India) Ltd.(1). But the majority in the recent decision in the Bengal Immunity Co. Ltd. v. State of Bihar(2) including the said learned Judge, have left that question open. It is problematical whether having regard to the inevitable extra-territorial operation of the levy of such a tax and the consequent harassment to the business community which looms large, the Explanation will receive that construction again and not receive the strict construction preferred in the dissenting judgment in the case in State of Travancore-Cochin v. Shanmugha Vilas Cashew Nut Factory(3). The result, therefore, of construing the proviso and by parity of reasoning the saving clause, as merely removing the ban of a particular nature leaving another overlapping ban to operate, would be to render both the saving clause in, and the proviso to, article 286(2) virtually nugatory.

The argument based on the non-obstante clause in the proviso, viz. "Notwithstanding that the imposition of such tax is contrary to the provisions of this clause" remains to be considered. It is urged that this clause clearly indicates the intention that the operation of the proviso is to be confined to the sole purpose of lifting the ban arising under article 286(2). With respect, I am unable to agree. The non-obstante clause undoubtedly affirms the fact that the 'proviso is operative in respect of article 286(2). But it does not purport to limit the effect of the proviso, which a reasonable construction thereof may justify. A non- obstante clause does not normally add to or subtract from the main provision of which it is a part. It is often enough inserted by way of extra caution. But it does not have the effect of limiting the operation of the main provision. (See Aswini Kumar Ghosh v. Arabinda Bose(1) and The Dominion of India v. Shrinbai A. Irani(2)). The suggestion that the Presidential action lifts the ban only as regards the inter-State sales would be to read the phrase "notwithstanding that" as meaning "in so far as". I can see no warrant for any such reading.
In my view, therefore, the pre-Constitution salestax laws, if then lawful, are not hit by article 286(1) (a)-at least to the extent that the ban under article 286(1) (a) overlaps with that under article 286(2). 'In this 'view, the orders of assessment in these cases cannot be set aside and the validity of the relevant preConstitution laws will have to be considered and the further facts gone into. But it is now not necessary to do so in these cases in the view taken by my learned brothers and the order proposed by them will govern these cases.
