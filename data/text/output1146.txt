Purshottam Tricumdas, K. K. Desai and I. N. Shroff, for the respondents.
1958. March 31. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI J.-This appeal with a certificate of fitness is directed against the judgment and decree passed by the High Court,of Judicature at Bombay in appeal from its ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction confirming, though on different grounds, the judgment and decree passed by a single Judge of that High Court in Suit No. 468 of 1951 instituted by the appellants (Original Plaintiffs) to recover from the respon- dents (Original Defendants) a sum of Rs. 1,80,099-8-0 with interest and costs.
By-law 80 of the Association:-
By-law: 139.
By-law: 141.	Issue
Since the year 1932 the first appellant has been a member of the East India Cotton Association Ltd., (hereinafter referred to as " the Association " ) as the sole 'proprietor of the firm of Messrs. Narrondass Manordass There in after referred to as "the member firm"). The first appellant along with other partners carried on business in partnership in Bombay inter alia as Cotton Merchants and Commission Agents in the name and style of Messrs. Narrondass Manordass, the 2nd appellant (hereinafter referred to as "
A further sum of Rs. 350 being the amount of penalty for the alleged failure to tender the aforesaid 700 bales of the said contracts of Broach/Vijay March/April 1948 Delivery, was also paid by the partnership firm to the respondents on June 6, 1948, without prejudice to their aforesaid contentions.
The said Ramanlal Nagindas had entered into similar transactions with several other merchants and some of them claimed arbitration under by-law 38-A of the Association. Petitions were thereupon filed by the member firm in the High Court at Bombay being Petitions Nos. A/51, A/52, A/55 and A/56 of 1949 under s. 33 of the Indian Arbitration Act inter alia for a declaration that there existed no valid and enforceable arbitration agreement between the parties. Mr. Justice Shah delivered judgment in the said petitions on August 20, 1950, holding inter alia that the said contracts were void as being not in accordance with the by- laws of the Association and allowed those petitions. The respondents to the petitions thereupon filed petitions under Art. 136 of the Constitution for special leave to appeal to this Court against the said judgment of Mr. Justice Shah. These petitions were, however, dismissed by this Court on or about April 6, 1951.
The appellants thereafter by their attorney's letter dated May 2, 1951, called upon the respondents to return the said sum of I-Is. 1,80,099-8-0 (being the aggregate of the said two sums of Rs. 1,79,749-8-0 and Rs. 350.) with interest thereon at the rate of 6 per cent. per annum. The respondents failed and neglected to pay to the appellants the said sum or any part thereof with the result that on May 7, 1951, the appellants filed the suit against the respondents for repayment to them of the said sum with interest and costs.
They also contended that at all material times there was no by law which required any person to agree upon any specific measurements in respect of the bales agreed to be purchased inasmuch as the operation of by-law 101 in regard thereto had been suspended by the Board since November 30, 1942. After the suit reached hearing the appellants amended the plaint by averring that by reason of the said payments having been made by them and accepted by the respondents without prejudice to the rights and contentions of both the parties there was an implied agreement between them that in the event of the appellant's establishing that they were not bound to pay the said sums to the respondents and that the respondents were not entitled to the payment thereof the respondents would repay or return the same to the appellants. This plea was traversed by the respondents in the supplemental written statement which they filed. The learned trial Judge followed the judgment of Mr. Justice Shah and held that the omission of the clause regarding measurement in the contract notes did not alter the character or legal effect of the contracts. He similarly held that the omission of any reference in the contracts to the amount of difference above or below the settlement rate of hedge contracts in the last term of the contract notes rendered the contracts void. He however was of the opinion that there was no implied agreement between the parties of the nature alleged by the appellants and that the payment made by appellants to the respondents was voluntary and therefore dismissed the appellants' suit with costs. The appellants preferred ail, appeal against this decision and the appellate Court dismissed the appeal and confirmed the decree passed by the learned trial Judge, though on different grounds. The appellate Court agreed with the learned trial Judge that the omission of the term regarding measurement in the contract notes did not affect the character or legal affect of the contracts. In regard to the omission to fill-up the difference above or below the settlement rate fixed for the hedge contracts in the last clause of the contract notes, however, the appellate Court was of the opinion that there was no obligation on the parties to agree to add or deduct the difference above or below the settlement rate as contended by the appellants. If the parties did agree then the contract form provided that the agreement should be set out therein. If, however, they did not agree then the first part of cl. (2) of by law 141 would come into play and the settlement of the delivery contract would go through on the basis of the settlement rate of the hedge contract. The omission to fill-up the difference was thus of no consequence and did not invalidate the contracts. The appellate Court also differed from the trial Judge on the question of the implied agreement and held that if the appellants succeeded in establishing that the respondents were not entitled to receive the payments the respondents were bound to repay the sums paid by the appellants to them. In view, however, of the conclusion reached that the contracts were not void, the appellate Court dismissed the appeal.	Facts

In the plaint as filed the appellants averred that the said contracts were void under the Bombay Cotton Contracts Act, 1932, as being not in accordance with the by-laws of the Association inter alia in the following respects: (1) The contract notes produced by the respondents omitted to state the difference of Rs......... above or below the settlement rate of hedge contracts for the purpose of periodical settlements as required by by-laws 139 and 141; and (2) no provision was made in any of the aforesaid contract notes with regard to the measurement of bales as required by the official form for delivery contracts prescribed in bylaw 80. The respondents in their written statement contended that there was no by-law which required any person to agree upon any difference above or below the settlement rate of hedge contracts for the purpose of periodical settlements and to state the same. They further contended that the relative provisions contained in the official contract form had become obsolete as at all material times there were no hedge contracts bearing different numbers and in practice the said contracts were not put through periodical settlements.	PetArg
The Board shall have power from time to time and at any time to suspend the operation of this Bylaw as regards measurements.	RespArg
arrived, sales in respect of 700 bales remained outstanding and the member firm was liable to give delivery of 700 bales to the respondents. As however, the member firm failed to give delivery of the said 700 bales to the respondents, under the relevant by-laws of the Association, the respondents " Invoiced Back " these 700 bales to the member firm on May 3, 1948, and as a result of this " Invoicing Back " a sum of Rs. 1,07,530-8-0 became due and payable by the member firm to the respondents and with regard to the transactions of all the 2,300 bales taken together an aggregate sum of Rs. 1,79,749-8-0 became due and payable by the member firm to the respondents. In respect of this sum of Rs. 1,79,749-8-0, the respondents sent to the member firm eight separate " Debit Notes " in respect of varying amounts and finally a consolidated debit note for Rs. 1,79,749-8-0. It appears that the contract notes in respect of these transactions had been signed by one Ramanlal Nagindas who had been employed as a salesman in the Ready Cotton Department of the partnership firm. The appellants contended that the said Ramanlal Nagindas had no authority to enter into the said transactions or to sign contract notes in respect thereof on behalf of the appellants and also that the said contracts were not in accordance with the by-laws of the Association and they therefore denied their liability in respect of the said transactions. The partnership firm, however, as the beneficiary under the said contracts decided to pay the amounts claimed by the respon- dents without prejudice to the rights and contentions of both the parties. On May 7, 1948, the said sum of Rs. 1,79,748-8-0 was paid by the partnership firm and was received by the respondents in terms of the letter addressed by the respondents on the said date:-
(2)In the case of Delivery Contracts, the settlement price of the Hedge Contract shall be the basis for the periodical settlement. Such allowances as shall be agreed upon by the parties in their contract to cover any difference, between the cotton contracted -for and the cotton which is the basis of the Hedge Contract shall be added to or deducted from the said settlement price. In the case of contracts for descriptions which are not tenderable against the Hedge Contract the parties may either agree in their contract upon an allowance above or below the Hedge Contract for the purpose of their periodical settlement or may apply to the Board to fix settlement rates.	Precedent
The -provisions of the Bombay Cotton Contracts Act, 1932 (Bom. IV of 1932) and the by-laws of the Association which fall to be considered by us may now be referred to:-
Settlement rates.-(1) For the purpose of these settlements, settlement prices for all positions of the Hedge Contract shall be fixed by the Board on or about the third working day immediately preceding Settlement Day. The prices so fixed shall be I P. M. prices on the day of fixation.
The position as it obtained at the time when the suit contracts were entered into was that by-law 101 as regards measurement had been suspended and there was no necessity so far as the by-laws went to make any mention in the contracts in regard to the same. If the claim for excess measurement had not to be entertained, it was not at all necessary to mention the measurement in the contract forms and there would be substantial compliance with the contract form, even though no measurement was mentioned therein, the very basis for the mention of such measurement having disappeared. It was, however, urged on behalf of the appellants that measurement was an essential part of the description of the goods sold and the suspension of by-law 101 made it all the more necessary that the measurement should be specified in the contract form itself. The standard measurement which had been mentioned in by-law 101 had disappeared and it would therefore be necessary to mention in the contract form what was the measurement on the basis of which the price of the contract had been fixed by and between the parties. If the bales actually tendered measured more in weight than what was actually agreed upon, the purchaser would be entitled to obtain from the seller an allowance for such excess measurement and that was the reason why it was necessary after the suspension of by-law 101 to mention the agreed measurement between the parties.	Section
........................................................... The only question for our determination in this appeal is whether the contracts between the parties were not in accordance with the by-laws of the Association and therefore void. There is no doubt that all the contracts were subject to the by-laws of the Association. The question still remains whether they were in accordance with the by-laws because if they were not in accordance with those by-laws they would be void. The expression " not in accordance with " has been the subject of judicial interpretation in Radhakisson Gopikisson v. Balmukund Ramchandra (1). Their Lordships of the Privy Council there held that the form prescribed was not a stereotyped one and that literal compliance with it was not essential. The only thing required was that the contract notes must contain all the terms and conditions set out in the form in order to comply with it. Their Lordships were of the opinion that substantial compliance with the form would be enough and if such sufficient compliance with the by-laws was found in a particular case that would save the contracts from being declared void as not being in accordance with the by-laws. It was, however, urged on behalf of the appellants that by- law 80 prescribes the form in which the contracts were to be entered into and all the terms and (1) (1932) L.R. 60 I.A. 63.
The result therefore is that this appeal fails and must stand dismissed with costs throughout.
Appeal dismissed.	Conclusion

1958. March 31. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI J.-This appeal with a certificate of fitness is directed against the judgment and decree passed by the High Court,of Judicature at Bombay in appeal from its ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction confirming, though on different grounds, the judgment and decree passed by a single Judge of that High Court in Suit No. 468 of 1951 instituted by the appellants (Original Plaintiffs) to recover from the respon- dents (Original Defendants) a sum of Rs. 1,80,099-8-0 with interest and costs.

The -provisions of the Bombay Cotton Contracts Act, 1932 (Bom. IV of 1932) and the by-laws of the Association which fall to be considered by us may now be referred to:-
By-law 80 of the Association:-
The Board shall have power from time to time and at any time to suspend the operation of this Bylaw as regards measurements.
By-law: 139.
By-law: 141.
Settlement rates.-(1) For the purpose of these settlements, settlement prices for all positions of the Hedge Contract shall be fixed by the Board on or about the third working day immediately preceding Settlement Day. The prices so fixed shall be I P. M. prices on the day of fixation.
(2)In the case of Delivery Contracts, the settlement price of the Hedge Contract shall be the basis for the periodical settlement. Such allowances as shall be agreed upon by the parties in their contract to cover any difference, between the cotton contracted -for and the cotton which is the basis of the Hedge Contract shall be added to or deducted from the said settlement price. In the case of contracts for descriptions which are not tenderable against the Hedge Contract the parties may either agree in their contract upon an allowance above or below the Hedge Contract for the purpose of their periodical settlement or may apply to the Board to fix settlement rates.
........................................................... The only question for our determination in this appeal is whether the contracts between the parties were not in accordance with the by-laws of the Association and therefore void. There is no doubt that all the contracts were subject to the by-laws of the Association. The question still remains whether they were in accordance with the by-laws because if they were not in accordance with those by-laws they would be void. The expression " not in accordance with " has been the subject of judicial interpretation in Radhakisson Gopikisson v. Balmukund Ramchandra (1). Their Lordships of the Privy Council there held that the form prescribed was not a stereotyped one and that literal compliance with it was not essential. The only thing required was that the contract notes must contain all the terms and conditions set out in the form in order to comply with it. Their Lordships were of the opinion that substantial compliance with the form would be enough and if such sufficient compliance with the by-laws was found in a particular case that would save the contracts from being declared void as not being in accordance with the by-laws. It was, however, urged on behalf of the appellants that by- law 80 prescribes the form in which the contracts were to be entered into and all the terms and (1) (1932) L.R. 60 I.A. 63.
conditions incorporated in the official contract form had to be strictly complied with, that the omission of the term as to measurement as also the omission to fill in the blanks in regard to difference of Rs...... above or below the settlement rate of hedge contract No. .................. were such departures from the form prescribed as would render the contracts void because it could not be then said that there was sufficient compliance with the statutory form. Reliance was placed in support of this contention on Burchell v. Thompson (1), Ex-parte Stanford, In re Barber (2), Thomas v. Kelly (3) and Parsons v. Brand & Cols v. Dickson (4). The principle emerging from these decisions was enunciated to be that if the document executed by and between the parties departed from a characteristic part of the form prescribed or made a difference in the legal effect of the instrument, it would not be in accordance with the form and would therefore be void. It would all depend upon the materiality of the -particular term which is incorporated in the form. If the non-compliance with the requirements of the form were such as to make the document something else by reason of a characteristic part of the form not being followed or the document would lose some legal effect which it would have had if the proper words had been inserted therein, it cannot be said that there is sub- stantial compliance with the statutory form. Considering the term as to measurement in this light, it appears that the same had its basis in the requirements of the trade in regard to the pressing of the bales. The bales which were the subject-matter of these forward delivery contracts were either meant for transport within the country or export outside the country. The bales were to be fully pressed so as to occupy the minimum space either in transport by rail or by steamer and initially they were bound with hoops. The baling hoops were however difficult to obtain from Japan and therefore the bales came to be bound with ropes made of cotton, jute coir and hemp. The bales thus bound otherwise than with hoops (1) [1920] 2 K. B. 80.
(3) (1888) 13 App. Cas. 506.(2) (1886) 17 Q.B.D. 259. (4) (1890) 25 Q.B.D. 110, occupied more space and difficulties were encountered by the merchants because of their being obliged to pay -extra insurance and freight charges in respect of such bales. Not only did the railways charge more for the transport of such bales, the shipping companies also did so and the insurance companies charged higher rates for insurance because the bales were not pressed in a manner which would minimise the risks of insurance. All these factors brought about a situation creating difficulties between the purchasers and the sellers of cotton and these difficulties had to be resolved by the Association. by law 101 had proceeded on the basis of cotton bales being bound with hoops, the approximate measurement in tons as agreed and understood in the trade being, 13-1/2 tons per 50 bales. That was the standard measurement. It was open however to the parties to agree upon any other measurement. If any measurement other than the standard measurement was agreed to, an adjustment had to be made by reason of such difference in measurement and by-law 101 provided that certain amount therein specified had got to be paid by the seller to the purchaser as and by way of allowance for such excess measurement. Towards October, 1942, the situation in regard to the baling hoops deteriorated so much that it was thought desirable that bales bound with ropes should be permitted to be tendered under the by-laws of the Association and that the operation of by-law 101 as regards measurements should be suspended. There were heavy fluctuations in the prices of the materials permitted to be used, and it was therefore thought advisable to fix certain allowances from time to time or before the beginning of the delivery periods taking into consideration the extra insurance and freight charges, if any, in respect of such bales. A sub-committee appointed by the Association made a report in this behalf on October 29, 1942, and on November 20 1942, the Board of Directors of the Association passed a resolution approving the recommendations of the subcommittee with this modification that the allowance to be prescribed in the price of bales bound with ropes as against the price of bales bound with hoops as provided in by-laws 96 and 119, be fixed before the commencement of the season and not be altered from time to time. The Board of Directors issued a notice on November 30, 1942, suspending the operation of bylaw 101 as regards the measurement until further notice.
The position as it obtained at the time when the suit contracts were entered into was that by-law 101 as regards measurement had been suspended and there was no necessity so far as the by-laws went to make any mention in the contracts in regard to the same. If the claim for excess measurement had not to be entertained, it was not at all necessary to mention the measurement in the contract forms and there would be substantial compliance with the contract form, even though no measurement was mentioned therein, the very basis for the mention of such measurement having disappeared. It was, however, urged on behalf of the appellants that measurement was an essential part of the description of the goods sold and the suspension of by-law 101 made it all the more necessary that the measurement should be specified in the contract form itself. The standard measurement which had been mentioned in by-law 101 had disappeared and it would therefore be necessary to mention in the contract form what was the measurement on the basis of which the price of the contract had been fixed by and between the parties. If the bales actually tendered measured more in weight than what was actually agreed upon, the purchaser would be entitled to obtain from the seller an allowance for such excess measurement and that was the reason why it was necessary after the suspension of by-law 101 to mention the agreed measurement between the parties.
This argument however ignores the fact that simultaneously with the suspension of the operation of the by-law 101, by- laws 96 and 119 which referred to forward and hedge contracts respectively were altered and provision was made therein to incorporate measures consequent upon the tender of bales bound with ropes in place of bales bound with hoops. The consequences of such tenders were worked out in the by-laws as thus amended and allowances in the price of bales bound with ropes as against the price of bales bound with hoops were also provided for. These allowances were in accordance with the resolution of the Board dated November 20, 1942, to be fixed before the commencement of the season and if such allowances were provided for there was nothing further to be done in regard to the difference in measurement, if any. If the situation which obtained after November 20, 1942, provided for a tender of bales bound with ropes instead of bales bound with hoops in fulfilment of the contracts entered into between the parties, that was well known to all the members of the Association and it was open to them while fixing the prices themselves to take count of the extra charges for insurance and freight which would be payable by the purchaser in the event of bales bound with ropes being tendered instead of bales bound with hoops. It, therefore, follows that the omission to mention the measurements in the contract notes did not render the contracts not in accordance with the by-laws. There was no such by-law in operation at the time and even otherwise there was no need whatever to incorporate in the contract notes any term as to measurement. It could not therefore be said that there was any departure from an essential or a characteristic part of the contract form or that the legal effect of the contracts was changed so as to invalidate the same.
When we come to the term in regard to the differences of Rs............... above or below the settlement rate of hedge contract No............... we find that that had reference to periodical settlements of contracts through the clearing house. In accordance with bylaw 139 all delivery contracts other than those excepted under by-law 136 and hedge contracts were subject to periodical settlements through the Clearing House which settlements had to be made once weekly on days fixed by the Board. If the contracts had got to go through the clearing house in this manner it was necessary also that settlement rates should be fixed and by-law 141(1) provided that settlement prices for all positions of the hedge contract should be fixed by the Board. The settlement prices thus fixed were to be taken as the basis for the periodical settlement of delivery contracts and it was further provided in bylaw 141(2) that such allowance as shall be agreed upon by the parties in their contracts to cover any difference between the cotton contracted for and the cotton which was the basis of the hedge contract shall be added to or deducted from the said settlement prices. This was the basis of the provision contained in the relevant term of the contract form. In the case of contracts for descriptions not renderable against the hedge contract it was open to the parties either to agree upon an allowance above or below the hedge contract or they would make an application to the Board to fix the settlement rates. Whenever there was an agreement in this behalf the parties were to mention the difference thus agreed into the contract form and the periodical settlements of delivery contracts were to be effected on that basis. The question arises as to whether the parties were bound to enter into any such agreement at the time they entered into the contracts. It was contended on behalf of the appellants that such an agreement was necessary because it would otherwise involve the parties into payment of large sums of money on the settlement day next after the day of the contract. The hedge contracts appertained to cotton of the lowest average and if the quality of cotton which was the subject-matter of the contract between the parties was, as was usual, of a higher variety, it would involve the payment of large amounts by way of differences on the next settlement day, which certainly would not be within the contemplation of the contracting parties. If that was so, the parties would agree to a difference between the rates of the cotton contracted for and the cotton which was the basis of the hedge contract and this difference above or below would serve to minimize the incidence of such payment on the next settlement day. It was, therefore, submitted that it was incumbent on the parties when entering into a contract to fill-in this term as to differences. If they agreed upon such differences the blank had to be filled-in accordingly; but even though they did not agree upon any such differences, it was necessary for them to mention in the contract form that the difference above or below the rate of the hedge contract agreed upon by them was nil. It was contended on the other hand on behalf of the respondent that there was no obligation on the parties entering into the contract to fill in that term. If they agreed upon the difference all well and good but if they did not agree upon the difference, the first part of by-law 141(2) stepped in and the consequences had to be worked out as if there was no agreement and the differences had to be paid on the settlement day next ensuing on the basis of the difference between the contract rates and rates of hedge contract, even though it may involve a payment of a substantial amount all at once. According to this submission, in the case of contracts for descriptions tenderable againt the hedge contract two positions arose:
The manner in which the official contract form which had been settled when the by-laws of the Association came first to be promulgated has been retained in its pristine glory in spite of the various changes made in the operation of the by-laws and the practice of the trade only enhances the difficulties of the parties and enables the parties who are so minded to raise all sorts of disputes tenable or otherwise in order to avoid their liability in respect of the transactions effected by them in the Association. It may be hoped that the Association will take effective steps to bring the official contract form in conformity with the bylaw,% in operation from time to time and the practice of the trade prevailing in the Association.
The result therefore is that this appeal fails and must stand dismissed with costs throughout.
Appeal dismissed.	Total Judgement
