CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 230 of 1956. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated April 12, 1955, of the Orissa High Court in 0. J. C. No. 60 of 1952.
S. N. Andley, J. B. Dadachanji and Rameshuar Nath, for the respondent.
our learned Brother S. K. Das J. for reasons stated by him that the assessment orders for the three post Constitution quarters were hit by cl. (1) of Art. 286 and also s. 30 (1)	Issue
On August 14, 1947, a notification was issued by the Government of Orissa appointing September 30, 1947, as the date with effect from which that sub-section was to come into force in the then province of Orissa.
On January 1, 1948, by a covenant of merger executed by its ruler, the feudatory State of Pallahara merged into the province of Orissa. In exercise of the powers delegated to it by the Government of India under what was then known as the Extra Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947, the Government of Orissa on December 14, 1948, issued a notification under s. 4 of that Extra Provincial Jurisdiction Act, extending the Orissa Sales Tax Act to the territories of the erstwhile feudatory States, including Pallahara which had merged into the province of Orissa. On March 1, 1949, a notification under s. 1(3) was issued by the Government of Orissa bringing ss. 2 to 29 of the said Act into force in the added territories. On the same day another notification was issued under s. 4(1) of the Act, which was in the following terms:
The short facts are these. The respondent, Messrs.B. C. Patel and Co., is a partnership firm carrying on the business of collection and sale of Kendu leaves. The firm has its headquarters at Pallahara, which was formerly one of the Feudatory States of Orissa and merged in the. then province of Orissa by a merger agreement dated January 1, 1948. The Sales Tax authorities, Cuttack, in the State of Orissa, assessed the respondent to sales tax in respect of sales of Kendu leaves which took place for five quarters ending on September 30, 1949, December 31, 1949, June 30, 1950, September 30, 1950 and December 31, 1950. It should be noted that two of the aforesaid quarters related to a period prior to the commencement of the Constitution, and the remaining three quarters were post-Constitution. The facts which the Sales Tax authorities found were (I.) that the respondent collected Kendu leaves in Orissa and sold them to various merchants of Calcutta, Madras and other places on receipt of orders from them, (2) that the goods were sent either f. o. r. Talcher or f. o. r. Calcutta, and (3) the sale price was realised by sending the bills to the purchasers for payment. The admitted position was that the goods were delivered for consumption at various places out- side the State of Orissa. The Sales Tax authorities proceeded on the footing that all the sales took place in Orissa even though the goods were delivered for con sumption at places outside Orissa. By five separate assessment orders dated May 31, 1951, the Sales Tax Officer, Cuttack, held that the sales having taken place in Orissa, the respondent was clearly liable to sales tax for the pre- Constitution period and, for the post-Constitution period, though the sales came within cl. (2) of Art. 286 of the Constitution, the respondent was liable to sales tax under the Sales Tax Continuance Order, 1950, made by the President. These findings were affirmed by the Assistant Collector of Sales Tax, Orissa, on appeal, by his order dated April 12, 1952. The respondent assessee then filed a petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution in the High Court of Orissa and prayed for the issue of a writ of certiorari or other appropriate writ quashing the aforesaid orders of assessment. The case of the respondent before the High Court was that the assessment orders., both with regard to the pre-Constitution and post-Constitution periods, were invalid and without jurisdiction. The High Court accepted the case of the respondent and held that the assessment orders for the entire period were invalid and without jurisdiction. The present appeal has been brought from the aforesaid judgment and order of the High Court of Orissa dated April 12, 1955.
SARKAR J.-The respondents are a firm of merchants carrying on business in a part of the State of Orissa which was formerly the feudatory State of Pallahara. This State of Pallahara had merged in the Province of Orissa under an agreement with the Government of India, dated January 1, 1948. On December 14, 1948, the Government of Orissa under the powers conferred by s. 4 of the Extra Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947, and with the permission of the Government of India, issued a Notification applying the Orissa Sales Tax Act, 1947 (Orissa XIV of 1947), passed by the Legislature of Orissa, to the areas which previously constituted the feudatory States including Pallahara, then merged in Orissa. The respondents were assessed to sales tax under this Act in respect of their sales which took place during five quarters between July 1, 1949 and December 31, 1950. They had appealed under the provisions of the Act to higher authorities from the original orders of assessment, but were unsuccessful. They then applied to the High Court of Orissa on November 11. 1952, for an appro- priate writ directing the Sales Tax Officer the assessing authority and one of the appellants herein, to refrain from realizing the tax or from giving effect to the assessment orders in any manner whatsoever and quashing such orders and also prohibiting future assessment. By its judgment delivered on April 12, 1955, the High Court allowed the petition and cancelled the assessment orders. From that judgment the present appeal has come to this Court. The question that I propose to discuss in this judgment is whether the respondents are liable to pay tax under the provisions of the Act in the circumstances which existed in this case and to which, I shall refer a little later. The sections of the Act under which the tax is sought to be levied are set out below:	Facts

What was found was that the respondent's gross turnover exceeded Rs. 5,000 in 1948-49, that is, the year ending March 31,, 1949, which was not the year immediately preceding the commencement of the Act in the Pallahara area. Obviously, therefore, sub-s. (1) did not apply to the respondent; but he clearly came under sub-s. (2). The Act came into force in the Orissa States on March 1, 1949. By March 31, 1949, the respondent's - gross turnover exceeded Rs. 5,000. He was, therefore, liable to pay tax under sub- s. (2 ) with effect from the commencement of the year immediately following March 31, 1949, that is, from April 1, 1949. It has been argued for the respondent that the word `first' in sub-s. (2) means ` first' after the commencement of the Act. Assuming this to be correct, the respondent still comes under sub-s. (2) because even if the Act came into force on March 1, 1949, the respondent's gross turnover first exceeded Rs. 5,000 in the year ending March 31, 1949 which was after the commencement of the Act.

1958. April 15. The Judgment of Das C. J. and Venkatarama Aiyar J. was delivered by Das C. J. The Judgment of S. K. Das and Vivian Bose JJ. was delivered by S. K. Das J. Sarkar J. delivered a separate judgment. DAS C. J.-We agree that this appeal must be allowed in part but we prefer to rest our judgment on one of the material points on a ground which is different from that adopted by our learned Brother S. K. Das J. in the judgment which has just been delivered by him and which we have had the advantage of perusing.
We now turn to the post-Constitution period. The short ground on which the High Court held the assessment orders for this period to be invalid was based on the decision of this Court in The State of Bombay v. The United Motors (India) Ltd. (1) Said the High Court:
goods are delivered for consumption outside Orissa. Hence, by virtue of clause (1) of Article 286 as explained by their Lordships of the Supreme Court, the State of Orissa is not competent to tax such transactions of sale." The learned Solicitor General has rightly pointed out that in a later decision of this Court in The Bengal Immunity Company Limited v. The State of Bihar and Others (1), which was, not available to the High Court when it delivered its judgment, the view expressed in the United Motors, case (2) was departed from in so far as the earlier decision held that cl. (2) of Art. 286 of the Constitution did not affect the power of the State in which delivery of goods was made to tax inter-State sales or purchases of the kind mentioned in the Explanation to cl. (1) and the effect of the Expla- nation was that such transactions were saved from the ban imposed by Art. 286 (2). The learned Solicitor General, therefore, contends that on the basis of the later decision, the assessments made should be held to be valid under the Sales Tax Continuance Order 1950, made by the President, even though the sales took place in course of inter-State trade or commerce.
(2) The explanation to clause (1) of Article 286 of the Constitution shall apply for the interpretation of sub- clause (i) of clause (a) of sub-section (1). We are of the view that the Bengal Immunity decision (1) does not really help the learned Solicitor-General to establish his contention that the assessments for the post-Constitution period were valid. The admitted position was that the goods sold were delivered for consumption at various places outside the State of Orissa. Therefore, under cl. (1) (a) of Art. 286 read with the Explanation as also under s. 30 of the Act, the sales were outside Orissa. It is true that the Bengal Immunity decision (1) took a view different from that of the earlier decision in so far as it held that inter- State sales were converted into intra-State sales by the Ex- planation; but it -was pointed out that the States' power with respect to a sale or purchase might be hit by one or more of the bans imposed by Art. 286. With reference to the different clauses of Art. 286, it was observed in the majority judgment of the Bengal Immunity decision(1):
At p. 647 of the- report, it was further observed--
As to the President's order, it was stated at p. 656:
Obviously, therefore, even on the Bengal Immunity decision. (1) the assessments for the post-Constitution period in this case were hit by cl. (1) (a) of Art. 286 as also s. 30 (1)
assessments for the post-Constitution period were invalid. In view of the divided success of the parties we further think that they should bear their own costs in the High Court and in this Court.
S.2. In this Act, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context,-
(j) " year " means the financial year.	Precedent
The Orissa Sales Tax Act, 1947 (Orissa XIV of 1947), hereinafter referred to as the said Act received the assent of the Governor-General on April 26, 1947, when s. I of 'the Act came into force. On August 1, 1947, a Notification was issued by the Government of Orissa bringing the rest of the said Act into force in the Province of Orissa, as it was then constituted. Section 4, as it stood at all times material to this appeal, ran as follows:
(a) (1) of the Act and were rightly held by the High Court to be without jurisdiction. It is with regard to the assessment orders for the two pre-Constitution quarters that we have come to a conclusion different from that to which our learned Brother has arrived. We proceed to state our reasons.
But before we do so, it is necessary to state some facts with regard to the enactment and enforcement of the Orissa Sales Tax Act, 1947 (Orissa XlV of 1947), hereinafter referred to as the Act, in the old province of Orissa and the ex-Feudatory State of Pallahara. The Act received the assent of the Governor General on April 26, 1947, and was first published in the Orissa Gazette on May 14,1947. Section I came into force at once in the old province of Orissa and sub-s. (3) of that section said that " the rest of the Act shall come into force on such date as the Provincial Government may, by notification in the Gazette, appoint ". The Provincial Government of Orissa notified August 1, 1947, as the date on which the rest of the Act was to come into force in the province of Orissa. It is neces- sary at this stage to refer to the charging section, namely s. 4 of the Act, which is set out below as it stood at the relevant time:
Two other provisions of the Act must be referred to here. The word "dealer" is defined in s. 2(c) in these terms :
The word " year " is defined ins. 2(j) and means the financial year.
notification is an essential prerequisite, and unless the notification complies with the requirements of the subsection, no liability to tax can arise under it. The notification not only fixed the relevant date, but fixed the relevant period for determining the class of dealers who would be subject to the liability. In doing so, it made a mistake, the result of which was that the notification was not in conformity with the law. We do not think that it can be severed in the way suggested by the learned Solicitor General.
Now, we come to the second argument whether the pre- Constitution assessment orders are justified under sub-s. (2) of s. 4. The High Court held that they were not, and gave two reasons for its view: one was that, subsections (1) and (2) were mutually exclusive and the other was based on the opening words of sub-s. (2), which says that " every dealer to whom sub-section (1) does not apply etc." The High Court expressed the view that if the notification under sub- s. (1) were correctly drawn up, the subsection would have applied to the respondent ; therefore, the opening words of sub-s. (2) barred the application of the sub-section to the respondent. At first sight, there appears to be some force in this view. But on a closer examination we do not think that the view expressed by the High Court is correct. Sub- sections (1) and (2) are mutually, exclusive only in the sense that they do not operate in the same field ; that is, the relevant periods for their application are different. The relevant period for the application of sub-s. (1) is "
Sub-section (2) however does not require any notification, and under it every dealer is liable to pay tax under the Act with effect from the commencement of the year immediately following that during which his gross turnover first exceeded Rs. 5,000. Obviously, the relevant period for the application of sub-s. (2) is the year immediately following that during which the gross turnover of a dealer first exceeded Rs. 5,000. The contrast between the two subsections is this: for sub-s. (1) the crucial year is the year immediately preceding the commencement of the, Act; but for sub-s. (2) the crucial, year is the year in which the dealer's gross turnover first exceeded Rs. 5,000. We agree that for the same relevant year both sub- sections (1) and (2) cannot apply, because sub-s. (2) says-"
It is necessary to state here that by the Adaptation of Laws (Third Amendment) Order, 1951, made by the President in exercise of the power given by cl. (2) of Art. 372 of the Constitution, s. 30 was inserted in the Act to bring it into accord with the Constitution, from January 26, 1950. Section 30 which in substance reproduced Art. 286 of the Constitution, as it then stood, was in these terms-
shall not, after the 31st day of March, 1951, be imposed where such sale or purchase takes place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce except in so far as Parliament may by law otherwise provide.
Explanation to clause (1) (a), (2) it will also offend Article 286 (2) as the sale has taken place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce and (3)such law will also be contrary to Article 286 (3) as the goods are essential commodities and the President's assent to the law was not obtained as required by clause (3) of Article 286. This appears to us to be the general scheme of that article." (see pp. 638-639 of the report).
(a) (i) of the Act and were rightly held to be without jurisdiction.
It is conceded that the respondents are dealers within the meaning of the Act. The term " turnover " is defined in the Act but for the purpose of this judgment it can be taken in its popular sense. It is also unnecessary to consider ss. 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the Act, for nothing turns on them in this appeal.
Section I of the Act came into force in the Pallahara area on December 14, 1948, by virtue of the notification of that date mentioned earlier. Oil March 1, 1949, the Government of Orissa issued under s. 1 (3) of the Act a notification, being Notification No. 2267/F appointing that date as the date on which the, rest of the Act would come into force in the Pallahara area. It is not in dispute that March 1, 1949, has to be considered as the date of the commencement of the Act in the Pallahara area. That is the result of the definition of the commencement of an Act given in s. 2 (8) of the Orissa General Clauses Act, 1937. As will have been noticed s. 4 (1) of the Act required a date to be appointed before liability under it could arise. Such a date had been appointed by the Government of Orissa before the Act was applied to the areas previously belonging to the feudatory States and the Government felt that this appointment of a date would not be an appointment for these areas. The case before us has proceeded oil the basis that appointment was not a proper appointment under this section for these areas. In fact, the Government of Orissa had oil March 1, 1949, issued a Notification No. 2269/F, purporting to appoint a date under s. 4 (1) for the areas previously covered by the feudatory States including the Pallahara State, then merged in Orissa. That Notification is in these terms:	Section
4. This concession clearly amounts to an admission that the gross turnover of the respondents during the financial year ending on March 31, 1948, which was the year immediately preceding March 31, 1949, exceeded Rs. 5,000. We have already held that the notification' issued under s. 4(1) in so far as it appointed March 31, 1949, as the date with effect from which the liability to pay sales tax would commence was good and valid in law. That finding coupled with the concession mentioned above relieves us from the necessity of remanding the case to the sales tax authorities. Even if we assume, contrary to the aforesaid concession, that the gross turnover of the respondents during the financial year ending on March 31, 1948, did not exceed Rs. 5,000 and, therefore, s. 4 (1) did not apply to them the respondents will still be liable to pay the sales tax for the two pre-Constitution quarters under s. 4 (2). For reasons stated above we hold that the assessment orders for the three post-Constitution quarters were invalid and we accordingly agree that this appeal, in so far as it is against that part of the order of the -High Court which cancelled the assessment orders for those three post- Constitution quarters, should be dismissed. We further hold that the assessments for the two pre-Constitution quarters were valid for reasons stated above and accordingly we agree in allowing this appeal in so far as it is against that part of the order of the High Court which cancelled the assessment orders for the two pre-Constitution quarters Oil the ground that the notification issued under s. 4 (1) of the Act was wholly invalid. Under the circumstances of this case we also agree that the parties should bear their own costs in the High Court as well as in this Court. S. K. DAS J.-This appeal on behalf of the assessing authorities, Cuttack, has been brought pursuant to an order made on January 17, 1956, granting them special leave to appeal to this Court from the judgment and order of the High Court of Orissa dated April 12,1955, by which the High Court quashed certain orders of assessment of sales tax made against the respondent.
The result, therefore, is that in our view this appeal should succeed in part, as we hold that the assessments for the -two quarters of the pre-Constitution period were valid under sub-s. (2) of s. 4 of the Act and the (1) [1955] 2 S.C.R. 603.
S. 4. (1) Subject to the provisions of sections 5, 6, 7 and 8 and with effect from such date as the Provincial Government may, by notification in the Gazette, appoint, being not earlier than thirty days after the date of the said notification, every dealer whose gross turnover during the year immediately preceding the commencement of this Act exceeded Rs. 5,000 shall be liable to pay tax under the Act on sales effected after the date so notified:
Such candidate continues to be contesting candidate for the purposes of the Act, notwithstanding his retirement from the contest under s. 55A (2).
When we come to the provisions of Part VI of the Act relating to disputes regarding election, we find that there is no definition given in s. 79 of the expression "
candidate " and " returned candidate " to be found therein. An election petition calling in question any election can be presented by any candidate at such election or any elector on one, or more of the grounds specified in ss. 100 (1) and 101 to the Election Commission and a petitioner in addition to calling in question the election of the returned candidate, or candidates may further claim a declaration that he himself or any other candidate has been duly elected. Where the petitioner claims such further declaration, he must join as respondents to his petition all the contesting candidates other than the petitioner and also any other candidate against whom allegations of any corrupt practices are made in the petition. The words " other than the petitioner " are meant to exclude the petitioner when he happens to be one of the contesting candidates who has been defeated at the polls and would not apply where the petition is filed for instance by an elector. An elector filing such a petition would have to join all the contesting candidates whose names were included in the list of contesting candidates prepared and published by the returning officer in the manner prescribed under s. 38, that is to say, candidates who were included in the list of validly nominated candidates and who had not withdrawn their candidature within the period prescribed. Such contesting candidates will have to be joined as respondents to such petition irrespective of the fact that one or more of them had retired from the contest tinder s. 55A (2). If the provisions of s. 82 which prescribes who shall be joined as respondents to the petition are not complied with, the Election Commission is enjoined under s. 85 of the Act to dismiss the petition and similar are the consequences of noncompliance with the provisions of s. 117 relating to deposit of security of costs. If the Election Commission however does not do so and accepts the petition, it has to cause a copy of the petition to be published in the official gazette and a copy thereof to be served by post on each of the respondents and then refer the petition to an election tribunal for trial. Section 90 (3) similarly enjoins the Election Tribunal to dismiss an election petition which does not comply with the provisions of s. 82 or s. 117 notwithstanding that it has not been dismissed by the Election Commission under s. 85. Section 90 (3) is mandatory and the Election Tribunal is bound to dismiss such a petition if an application is made before it for the purpose.
Turning now to s. 117, we find that it is a provision relating to the deposit of security for the costs of the petition. When a petitioner presents an election petition to the Election Commission under s. 81 he is to enclose with the petition a Government Treasury receipt showing that a deposit of one thousand rupees has been made by him either in a Government Treasury or in the Reserve Bank of India in favour of the Secretary to the Election Commission as security for the costs of the petition. The Government Treasury receipt must show that such deposit has been actually made by him either in a Government Treasury or in the Reserve Bank of India; it must also show that it has been so made in favour of the Secretary to the Election Commission and it must further show that it has been made as security for the costs of the petition. These are the three requirements of the section which have to be fulfilled. The question, however, arises whether the words " in favour of the Secretary to the Election Commission " are mandatory in character so that if the deposit has not been made in favour of the Secretary to the Election Commission as therein specified the deposit even though made in a Government Treasury or in the Reserve Bank of India and as security for the costs of the petition would be invalid and of no avail. If, for instance, the petitioner made the deposit either in a Government Treasury or in the Reserve Bank of India in favour of the Election Commission itself and obtained a Government Treasury receipt in regard to the same, could it be contended that in spite of such a deposit having been made, the said Government Treasury receipt was not in conformity with the requirements of s. 117 and the petitioner could be said not to have complied with the requirements of that section so as -to involve a dismissal of his petition under s. 85 or s. 90 (3) ?
The extreme case illustrated above has been taken by us only in order to demonstrate to what lengths a literal compliance with the provisions of s. 117 can be pushed. The petition is to be presented to the Election Commission, the security for the costs of the petition has to be given to the Election Commission and s. 121 provides for an application to be made in writing to the Election Commission for payment of costs by the person in whose favour the costs have been awarded and yet, even though the deposit may have been made by a petitioner in favour of the Election Commission and a Government Treasury receipt evidencing the same be enclosed along with his petition the provisions of s. 117 of the Act can be said not to have been complied with merely because the deposit was made in favour of the Election Commission and not in favour of the Secretary to the Election Commission. The relationship between the Election Commission on the one hand and the Secretary to the Election Commission on the other need not be scrutinized for the purposes of negativing this contention. It is enough to say that such a contention has only got to be stated in order to be negatived. It would be absurd to imagine that a deposit made either in a Government Treasury or in the Reserve Bank of India in favour of the Election Commission itself would not be sufficient compliance with the provisions of s. 117 and would involve a dismissal of the petition under s. 85 or s. 90 (3). The above illustration is sufficient to demonstrate that the words " in favour of the Secretary to the Election Commission " used in s. 117 are directory and not mandatory in their character. What is of the essence of the provision contained in s. 11.7 is that the petitioner should furnish security for the costs of the petition, and should enclose along with the petition a (Government Treasury receipt showing that a deposit of one thousand rupees has been made by him either in a Government Treasury or in the Reserve Bank of India, is at the disposal of the Election Commission to be utilised by it in the manner authorised by law and is under its control and payable on a proper application being made in that behalf to the Election Commission or to any person duly authorised by it to receive the same, be he the Secretary to the Election commission or any one else. If, therefore it can be shown by evidence led before the Election Tribunal that the government Treasury receipt or the chalan which was obtained by the petitioner and enclosed by him along with his petition presented to the Election Commission was such that the Election Commission could on a necessary application in that behalf be in a position to realise the said sum of rupees one thousand for payment of the costs to the successful party it would be sufficient compliance with the requirements of s. 117. No such literal compliance with the terms of s. 117 is at, all necessary as is contended for on behalf of the appellant before us. As regards the amendment of a petition by deleting the averments and the prayer regarding the declaration that either the petitioner or an other candidate has been. duly elected, so as to cure lie defect of nonjoinder of the necessary parties as respondents, we may only refer to our judgment * about Io be delivered in Civil Appeal No. 76 of 1958, where the question is discussed at considerable length. Suffice it to say here that the Election Tribunal has no power to grant such an amendment, be it by way of withdrawal or abandonment of a part of the claim or otherwise, once, an Election Petition has been presented to the Election (commission claiming such further declaration. Considering Civil Appeal No. 763 of 1957 in the light of the observations made above, we find that sundararaja Pillai whose name was included in the list of contesting candidates prepared and published by the returning officer under s. 38 but who retired from the contest under s. 55A (2) before the commencement of the poll was included in the expression "	Conclusion

J.-We agree that this appeal must be allowed in part but we prefer to rest our judgment on one of the material points on a ground which is different from that adopted by our learned Brother S. K. Das J. in the judgment which has just been delivered by him and which we have had the advantage of perusing.
The Orissa Sales Tax Act, 1947 (Orissa XIV of 1947), hereinafter referred to as the said Act received the assent of the Governor-General on April 26, 1947, when s. I of 'the Act came into force. On August 1, 1947, a Notification was issued by the Government of Orissa bringing the rest of the said Act into force in the Province of Orissa, as it was then constituted. Section 4, as it stood at all times material to this appeal, ran as follows:
On August 14, 1947, a notification was issued by the Government of Orissa appointing September 30, 1947, as the date with effect from which that sub-section was to come into force in the then province of Orissa.
On January 1, 1948, by a covenant of merger executed by its ruler, the feudatory State of Pallahara merged into the province of Orissa. In exercise of the powers delegated to it by the Government of India under what was then known as the Extra Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947, the Government of Orissa on December 14, 1948, issued a notification under s. 4 of that Extra Provincial Jurisdiction Act, extending the Orissa Sales Tax Act to the territories of the erstwhile feudatory States, including Pallahara which had merged into the province of Orissa. On March 1, 1949, a notification under s. 1(3) was issued by the Government of Orissa bringing ss. 2 to 29 of the said Act into force in the added territories. On the same day another notification was issued under s. 4(1) of the Act, which was in the following terms:
our learned Brother S. K. Das J. for reasons stated by him that the assessment orders for the three post Constitution quarters were hit by cl. (1) of Art. 286 and also s. 30 (1)
(a) (1) of the Act and were rightly held by the High Court to be without jurisdiction. It is with regard to the assessment orders for the two pre-Constitution quarters that we have come to a conclusion different from that to which our learned Brother has arrived. We proceed to state our reasons.
The impugned notification, as hereinbefore stated, was issued on March 1, 1949, under s. 4 (1) of the said Act. Under that sub-section every dealer whose gross turnover during the year immediately preceding the commencement of the Act exceeded Rs. 5,000 would be liable to pay the tax under the Act on sales effected after the date " so notified ", that is to say, the date which the provincial Government might by notification in the Gazette appoint. It is clear, therefore, that s. 4 (1) by its own terms determined the persons on whom the tax liability would fall but left it to the provincial Government only to appoint the date with effect from which the tax liability would commence. It follows, therefore, that the only 'power conferred by s. 4 (1) on the Government was to appoint, by a notification in the Official Gazette, a date with effect from which the tax liability would attach to the dealers described and specified in the sub-section itself as the persons on whom that liability would fall. The Government of Orissa issued the notification, hereinbefore quoted, " in exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (1) of section 4 " and appointed March 31, 1949, as the date with effect from which the tax liability would commence. It was none of the business of the Government of Orissa to say on what class of dealers the tax liability would fall, for that had been already determined by the sub-section itself Therefore, by the notification the Government of Orissa properly exercised its powers under sub-s. (1) in so far as it appointed March 31, 1949, as the date, but it exceeded its powers by proceeding to say that all dealers whose gross turnover during the year ending March 31, 1949, exceeded Rs. 5,000 should be liable to pay tax under the Act. This part of the notification clearly ran counter to the sub-section itself, for under that sub- section it is only those dealers whose gross turnover exceeded Rs. 5,000 " during the year immediately preceding the commencement of this Act " that became liable to pay the tax. For the purposes of the five assessment orders it made no difference whether the Act is taken to have commenced on December 14, 1948, when it was extended to the feudatory States by notification under s. 4 of the Extra Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947, or on March 1, 1949, when the notification under s. 1 (3) was issued, for in either case the year immediately preceding the commencement of this Act was April 1, 1947, to March 31, 1948. The position, therefore, is that by the earlier part of the impugned notification the Government of Orissa properly and rightly exercised its power in appointing March 31, 1949, as the date with effect from which the liability to pay tax under the Act would commence, but by its latter part did something more which it had no business to do, i. e., to indicate, contrary to the sub-section itself, that those dealers whose gross turnover during the year ending on March 31, 1949, would be liable to pay tax under the Act. The notification in so far as it purports to determine the class of dealers on whom the tax liability would fall, was certainly invalid. The question that immediately arises is as to whether the whole notification should be adjudged invalid as has been done by the High Court and as is proposed to be done by my learned Brother S. K. Das J. or the two portions of the notification should be severed and effect should be given to the earlier part which is in conformity with s. 4(1) and the latter part which goes beyond the powers conferred by the subsection to the Government of Orissa should be rejected. Immediately the question of severability arises. Are the two portions severable ? We find no difficulty in holding that the portion of the notification which went beyond the powers conferred on the Government of Orissa is quite clearly and easily severable from that which was within its powers. It cannot possibly be said that had the Government of Orissa known that it had no power to determine the persons on whom the tax liability would fall it would not have appointed a date at all. In our view there is no question of the two parts being inextricably wound up. We, therefore, hold that the notification, in so far as it appointed March 31, 1949, as the date with effect from which liability to pay tax would commence was valid and the rest of the notification was invalid and must be treated as surplus without any legal efficacy. The result, therefore, is that the charging section was effectively brought into force and the entire charging section became operative and dealers could be properly brought to charge under the appropriate part of the charging section. It is true that the notification having also stated that the dealers, whose gross turnover exceeded 5,000 (luring the year ending March 31, 1949, would be liable to pay the tax, the sales tax authorities naturally applied their mind to the question whether during the year ending March 31, 1949, the gross turnover of the respondents exceeded the requisite amount, but did not inquire into the question whether the respondent's gross turnover exceeded Rs. 5,000 during the year immediately preceding the commencement of the Act which in this case was the financial year from April 1, 1947 to March 31, 1948. If the matter stood there, it would have been necessary to send the case back to the Sales Tax Officer to enquire into and ascertain whether the quantum of the gross turnover of the respondents during the last mentioned financial year ending on March 31, 1948, exceeded Rs. 5,000 or it did not. But a remand is not called for because it appears from the judgment under appeal that it was conceded that for the period April 1, 1949, till the commencement of the Constitution on January 26, 1950, the respondents would have been liable to pay sales tax provided a valid notification had been issued, under sub-s. (1) of s.
4. This concession clearly amounts to an admission that the gross turnover of the respondents during the financial year ending on March 31, 1948, which was the year immediately preceding March 31, 1949, exceeded Rs. 5,000. We have already held that the notification' issued under s. 4(1) in so far as it appointed March 31, 1949, as the date with effect from which the liability to pay sales tax would commence was good and valid in law. That finding coupled with the concession mentioned above relieves us from the necessity of remanding the case to the sales tax authorities. Even if we assume, contrary to the aforesaid concession, that the gross turnover of the respondents during the financial year ending on March 31, 1948, did not exceed Rs. 5,000 and, therefore, s. 4 (1) did not apply to them the respondents will still be liable to pay the sales tax for the two pre-Constitution quarters under s. 4 (2). For reasons stated above we hold that the assessment orders for the three post-Constitution quarters were invalid and we accordingly agree that this appeal, in so far as it is against that part of the order of the -High Court which cancelled the assessment orders for those three post- Constitution quarters, should be dismissed. We further hold that the assessments for the two pre-Constitution quarters were valid for reasons stated above and accordingly we agree in allowing this appeal in so far as it is against that part of the order of the High Court which cancelled the assessment orders for the two pre-Constitution quarters Oil the ground that the notification issued under s. 4 (1) of the Act was wholly invalid. Under the circumstances of this case we also agree that the parties should bear their own costs in the High Court as well as in this Court. S. K. DAS J.-This appeal on behalf of the assessing authorities, Cuttack, has been brought pursuant to an order made on January 17, 1956, granting them special leave to appeal to this Court from the judgment and order of the High Court of Orissa dated April 12,1955, by which the High Court quashed certain orders of assessment of sales tax made against the respondent.
The short facts are these. The respondent, Messrs.B. C. Patel and Co., is a partnership firm carrying on the business of collection and sale of Kendu leaves. The firm has its headquarters at Pallahara, which was formerly one of the Feudatory States of Orissa and merged in the. then province of Orissa by a merger agreement dated January 1, 1948. The Sales Tax authorities, Cuttack, in the State of Orissa, assessed the respondent to sales tax in respect of sales of Kendu leaves which took place for five quarters ending on September 30, 1949, December 31, 1949, June 30, 1950, September 30, 1950 and December 31, 1950. It should be noted that two of the aforesaid quarters related to a period prior to the commencement of the Constitution, and the remaining three quarters were post-Constitution. The facts which the Sales Tax authorities found were (I.) that the respondent collected Kendu leaves in Orissa and sold them to various merchants of Calcutta, Madras and other places on receipt of orders from them, (2) that the goods were sent either f. o. r. Talcher or f. o. r. Calcutta, and (3) the sale price was realised by sending the bills to the purchasers for payment. The admitted position was that the goods were delivered for consumption at various places out- side the State of Orissa. The Sales Tax authorities proceeded on the footing that all the sales took place in Orissa even though the goods were delivered for con sumption at places outside Orissa. By five separate assessment orders dated May 31, 1951, the Sales Tax Officer, Cuttack, held that the sales having taken place in Orissa, the respondent was clearly liable to sales tax for the pre- Constitution period and, for the post-Constitution period, though the sales came within cl. (2) of Art. 286 of the Constitution, the respondent was liable to sales tax under the Sales Tax Continuance Order, 1950, made by the President. These findings were affirmed by the Assistant Collector of Sales Tax, Orissa, on appeal, by his order dated April 12, 1952. The respondent assessee then filed a petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution in the High Court of Orissa and prayed for the issue of a writ of certiorari or other appropriate writ quashing the aforesaid orders of assessment. The case of the respondent before the High Court was that the assessment orders., both with regard to the pre-Constitution and post-Constitution periods, were invalid and without jurisdiction. The High Court accepted the case of the respondent and held that the assessment orders for the entire period were invalid and without jurisdiction. The present appeal has been brought from the aforesaid judgment and order of the High Court of Orissa dated April 12, 1955.
Though before the Sales Tax authorities and in the High Court, an attempt was made on behalf of the respondent assessee to show that there were no completed sales in Orissa and what took place in Orissa was a mere agreement to sell, that question is no longer at large before us. The Sales Tax authorities found against the respondent on that question and the High Court did not consider it necessary to decide it on the petition filed by the respondent. The High Court proceeded on certain other grounds pressed before it by the respondent, and we proceed now to consider the validity of those grounds. The grounds are different , in respect of the two periods, pre-Constitution, and post- Constitution, and it will be convenient to take these two periods separately.
But before we do so, it is necessary to state some facts with regard to the enactment and enforcement of the Orissa Sales Tax Act, 1947 (Orissa XlV of 1947), hereinafter referred to as the Act, in the old province of Orissa and the ex-Feudatory State of Pallahara. The Act received the assent of the Governor General on April 26, 1947, and was first published in the Orissa Gazette on May 14,1947. Section I came into force at once in the old province of Orissa and sub-s. (3) of that section said that " the rest of the Act shall come into force on such date as the Provincial Government may, by notification in the Gazette, appoint ". The Provincial Government of Orissa notified August 1, 1947, as the date on which the rest of the Act was to come into force in the province of Orissa. It is neces- sary at this stage to refer to the charging section, namely s. 4 of the Act, which is set out below as it stood at the relevant time:
It is to be noticed that for a liability to arise under sub- s. (1) of s. 4, a notification by the Provincial Government is necessary, and the notification must fix the date from which every dealer whose gross turnover during the year immediately preceding the commencement of the Act exceeded Rs. 5,000 shall be liable to pay tax under the Act on sales effected after the date so notified. Such a notification was issued for the old province of Orissa on August 30, 1947, and September 30,1947, was fixed as the date with effect from which every dealer whose gross turnover during the year ending March 31, 1947, exceeded Rs. 5,000 was made liable to pay tax under the Act on sales effected after the said date. This was the position in the old province of Orissa. We have already stated that the ex-Feudatory State of Pallahara was merged into the old province of Orissa by a merger agreement dated January 1, 1948. After the merger of Pallahara in the old province of Orissa, the Government of Orissa under the delegated authority of the Central Government and exercising the powers under s. 4 of the Extra Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947 (XLVII of 1947) (as it was then called) applied the Act to the former Orissa States including Pallahara by a notification dated December 14, 1948. The only modification made in applying the Act to the Orissa States was to substitute the words " Orissa States "for the words "
Two other provisions of the Act must be referred to here. The word "dealer" is defined in s. 2(c) in these terms :
The word " year " is defined ins. 2(j) and means the financial year.
Now, with regard to the pre-Constitution period the High Court has found that the notification under subs. (1) of s. 4 dated March 1, 1949, was an invalid notification and therefore the respondent was not liable to tax under that subsection in respect of the transactions which took place in the pre-Constitution period. The reason why the High Court has held that the notification in question was invalid must now be stated. The scheme of sub-s. (1) of s. 4 is, firstly, to fix a date, not earlier than thirty days after the date of the notification, from which the liability is to commence; and, secondly, to impose a liability on, every dealer whose gross turnover during the year immediately preceding the commencement of the Act exceeded Rs. 5,000. The tax liability is on transactions of sale which take place after the notified date (which must necessarily be after the commencement of the Act); but in determining on which class of dealers, the incidence of taxation will fall, the crucial period as mentioned in the sub-section itself is the year immediately preceding the commencement of the Act. Therefore, the subsection contemplates two. matters, one of which may be called the 'relevant date', and the other 'relevant period'. So far as the old province of Orissa was concerned, there was no difficulty. The notification fixed September 30, 1947, as the relevant date, and the year immediately preceding the commencement of the Act in the old province of Orissa was the relevant period, viz., the financial year 1946-47, i. e., April 1, 1946 to March 31, 1947. Therefore dealers whose gross turnover exceeded Rs. 5,000 in 1946-47, became liable under sub-s. (1) of S. 4 to tax on transactions of sale after September 30, 1947, in the old province of Orissa. The notification for the Orissa States, however, fixed March 31, 1949, as the relevant date ; but in determining the class of dealers who would be subject to the liability, it took the year ending March 31, 1949, as the relevant period. This was clearly a mistake, because under sub-s. (1) of S. 4 the crucial year is the year immediately preceding the commencement of the Act. The Act commenced in the Orissa States either on December 14, 1948, or on March 1, 1949, and the financial year immediately preceding was the year 1947-48, i. e., April 1, 1947 to March 31, 1948. The notification would have been in consonance with the subsection, if it had mentioned the year ending March 31, 1948, (instead of March 31, 1949) as the crucial year for determining the class of dealers who would be subject to the liability under sub-s. (1) of S. 4. This mistake in the notification is the ground on which the High Court held that the assessments for the two quarters of the pre-Constitution period were invalid and without jurisdiction. The learned Solicitor-General who has appeared for the appellants has conceded that a mistake was made in the notification. However, lie has argued-firstly, that the mistake was immaterial and secondly, that the assessment orders for the pre-Constitution period were justified under sub-s. (2) of s: 4. As to the first argument that the mistake was immaterial, he has submitted that the liability to tax arose tinder the sub-section and not under the notification, and any mistake in the notification did not affect such liability; lie has also submitted that the words and figures which gave rise to the mistake were mere surplusage and could be severed from the rest of the notification. We are unable to accept this argument. For a liability to arise under sub-S. (1) of S. 47 the issue of a;
notification is an essential prerequisite, and unless the notification complies with the requirements of the subsection, no liability to tax can arise under it. The notification not only fixed the relevant date, but fixed the relevant period for determining the class of dealers who would be subject to the liability. In doing so, it made a mistake, the result of which was that the notification was not in conformity with the law. We do not think that it can be severed in the way suggested by the learned Solicitor General.
Now, we come to the second argument whether the pre- Constitution assessment orders are justified under sub-s. (2) of s. 4. The High Court held that they were not, and gave two reasons for its view: one was that, subsections (1) and (2) were mutually exclusive and the other was based on the opening words of sub-s. (2), which says that " every dealer to whom sub-section (1) does not apply etc." The High Court expressed the view that if the notification under sub- s. (1) were correctly drawn up, the subsection would have applied to the respondent ; therefore, the opening words of sub-s. (2) barred the application of the sub-section to the respondent. At first sight, there appears to be some force in this view. But on a closer examination we do not think that the view expressed by the High Court is correct. Sub- sections (1) and (2) are mutually, exclusive only in the sense that they do not operate in the same field ; that is, the relevant periods for their application are different. The relevant period for the application of sub-s. (1) is "
Sub-section (2) however does not require any notification, and under it every dealer is liable to pay tax under the Act with effect from the commencement of the year immediately following that during which his gross turnover first exceeded Rs. 5,000. Obviously, the relevant period for the application of sub-s. (2) is the year immediately following that during which the gross turnover of a dealer first exceeded Rs. 5,000. The contrast between the two subsections is this: for sub-s. (1) the crucial year is the year immediately preceding the commencement of the, Act; but for sub-s. (2) the crucial, year is the year in which the dealer's gross turnover first exceeded Rs. 5,000. We agree that for the same relevant year both sub- sections (1) and (2) cannot apply, because sub-s. (2) says-"
What was found was that the respondent's gross turnover exceeded Rs. 5,000 in 1948-49, that is, the year ending March 31,, 1949, which was not the year immediately preceding the commencement of the Act in the Pallahara area. Obviously, therefore, sub-s. (1) did not apply to the respondent; but he clearly came under sub-s. (2). The Act came into force in the Orissa States on March 1, 1949. By March 31, 1949, the respondent's - gross turnover exceeded Rs. 5,000. He was, therefore, liable to pay tax under sub- s. (2 ) with effect from the commencement of the year immediately following March 31, 1949, that is, from April 1, 1949. It has been argued for the respondent that the word `first' in sub-s. (2) means ` first' after the commencement of the Act. Assuming this to be correct, the respondent still comes under sub-s. (2) because even if the Act came into force on March 1, 1949, the respondent's gross turnover first exceeded Rs. 5,000 in the year ending March 31, 1949 which was after the commencement of the Act.
We are, therefore, of the view that all the requirements of sub-s. (2) are fulfilled in this case, and the two assessment orders made against the respondent for the pre- Constitution period were validly made under sub-s. (2) of s. 4 of the Act. The effect of the invalid notification under sub-s. (1) was that there was no liability thereunder, and no dealers were liable to pay tax under that sub-section. But that did not mean that any dealer who properly came under sub-s. (2) was free to escape his liability to pay tax. Surely, the position cannot be worse than what it would have been if the Provincial Government had failed to issue a, notification under sub-s. (1).
We now turn to the post-Constitution period. The short ground on which the High Court held the assessment orders for this period to be invalid was based on the decision of this Court in The State of Bombay v. The United Motors (India) Ltd. (1) Said the High Court:
State elements inasmuch as the buyers are outside Orissa, price is paid outside Orissa and (1) [1953] S.C.R. 1069.
goods are delivered for consumption outside Orissa. Hence, by virtue of clause (1) of Article 286 as explained by their Lordships of the Supreme Court, the State of Orissa is not competent to tax such transactions of sale." The learned Solicitor General has rightly pointed out that in a later decision of this Court in The Bengal Immunity Company Limited v. The State of Bihar and Others (1), which was, not available to the High Court when it delivered its judgment, the view expressed in the United Motors, case (2) was departed from in so far as the earlier decision held that cl. (2) of Art. 286 of the Constitution did not affect the power of the State in which delivery of goods was made to tax inter-State sales or purchases of the kind mentioned in the Explanation to cl. (1) and the effect of the Expla- nation was that such transactions were saved from the ban imposed by Art. 286 (2). The learned Solicitor General, therefore, contends that on the basis of the later decision, the assessments made should be held to be valid under the Sales Tax Continuance Order 1950, made by the President, even though the sales took place in course of inter-State trade or commerce.
It is necessary to state here that by the Adaptation of Laws (Third Amendment) Order, 1951, made by the President in exercise of the power given by cl. (2) of Art. 372 of the Constitution, s. 30 was inserted in the Act to bring it into accord with the Constitution, from January 26, 1950. Section 30 which in substance reproduced Art. 286 of the Constitution, as it then stood, was in these terms-
shall not, after the 31st day of March, 1951, be imposed where such sale or purchase takes place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce except in so far as Parliament may by law otherwise provide.
(2) The explanation to clause (1) of Article 286 of the Constitution shall apply for the interpretation of sub- clause (i) of clause (a) of sub-section (1). We are of the view that the Bengal Immunity decision (1) does not really help the learned Solicitor-General to establish his contention that the assessments for the post-Constitution period were valid. The admitted position was that the goods sold were delivered for consumption at various places outside the State of Orissa. Therefore, under cl. (1) (a) of Art. 286 read with the Explanation as also under s. 30 of the Act, the sales were outside Orissa. It is true that the Bengal Immunity decision (1) took a view different from that of the earlier decision in so far as it held that inter- State sales were converted into intra-State sales by the Ex- planation; but it -was pointed out that the States' power with respect to a sale or purchase might be hit by one or more of the bans imposed by Art. 286. With reference to the different clauses of Art. 286, it was observed in the majority judgment of the Bengal Immunity decision(1):
Explanation to clause (1) (a), (2) it will also offend Article 286 (2) as the sale has taken place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce and (3)such law will also be contrary to Article 286 (3) as the goods are essential commodities and the President's assent to the law was not obtained as required by clause (3) of Article 286. This appears to us to be the general scheme of that article." (see pp. 638-639 of the report).
At p. 647 of the- report, it was further observed--
As to the President's order, it was stated at p. 656:
Obviously, therefore, even on the Bengal Immunity decision. (1) the assessments for the post-Constitution period in this case were hit by cl. (1) (a) of Art. 286 as also s. 30 (1)
(a) (i) of the Act and were rightly held to be without jurisdiction.
The result, therefore, is that in our view this appeal should succeed in part, as we hold that the assessments for the -two quarters of the pre-Constitution period were valid under sub-s. (2) of s. 4 of the Act and the (1) [1955] 2 S.C.R. 603.
assessments for the post-Constitution period were invalid. In view of the divided success of the parties we further think that they should bear their own costs in the High Court and in this Court.
SARKAR J.-The respondents are a firm of merchants carrying on business in a part of the State of Orissa which was formerly the feudatory State of Pallahara. This State of Pallahara had merged in the Province of Orissa under an agreement with the Government of India, dated January 1, 1948. On December 14, 1948, the Government of Orissa under the powers conferred by s. 4 of the Extra Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947, and with the permission of the Government of India, issued a Notification applying the Orissa Sales Tax Act, 1947 (Orissa XIV of 1947), passed by the Legislature of Orissa, to the areas which previously constituted the feudatory States including Pallahara, then merged in Orissa. The respondents were assessed to sales tax under this Act in respect of their sales which took place during five quarters between July 1, 1949 and December 31, 1950. They had appealed under the provisions of the Act to higher authorities from the original orders of assessment, but were unsuccessful. They then applied to the High Court of Orissa on November 11. 1952, for an appro- priate writ directing the Sales Tax Officer the assessing authority and one of the appellants herein, to refrain from realizing the tax or from giving effect to the assessment orders in any manner whatsoever and quashing such orders and also prohibiting future assessment. By its judgment delivered on April 12, 1955, the High Court allowed the petition and cancelled the assessment orders. From that judgment the present appeal has come to this Court. The question that I propose to discuss in this judgment is whether the respondents are liable to pay tax under the provisions of the Act in the circumstances which existed in this case and to which, I shall refer a little later. The sections of the Act under which the tax is sought to be levied are set out below:
S.2. In this Act, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context,-
(j) " year " means the financial year.
S. 4. (1) Subject to the provisions of sections 5, 6, 7 and 8 and with effect from such date as the Provincial Government may, by notification in the Gazette, appoint, being not earlier than thirty days after the date of the said notification, every dealer whose gross turnover during the year immediately preceding the commencement of this Act exceeded Rs. 5,000 shall be liable to pay tax under the Act on sales effected after the date so notified:
It is conceded that the respondents are dealers within the meaning of the Act. The term " turnover " is defined in the Act but for the purpose of this judgment it can be taken in its popular sense. It is also unnecessary to consider ss. 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the Act, for nothing turns on them in this appeal.
Section I of the Act came into force in the Pallahara area on December 14, 1948, by virtue of the notification of that date mentioned earlier. Oil March 1, 1949, the Government of Orissa issued under s. 1 (3) of the Act a notification, being Notification No. 2267/F appointing that date as the date on which the, rest of the Act would come into force in the Pallahara area. It is not in dispute that March 1, 1949, has to be considered as the date of the commencement of the Act in the Pallahara area. That is the result of the definition of the commencement of an Act given in s. 2 (8) of the Orissa General Clauses Act, 1937. As will have been noticed s. 4 (1) of the Act required a date to be appointed before liability under it could arise. Such a date had been appointed by the Government of Orissa before the Act was applied to the areas previously belonging to the feudatory States and the Government felt that this appointment of a date would not be an appointment for these areas. The case before us has proceeded oil the basis that appointment was not a proper appointment under this section for these areas. In fact, the Government of Orissa had oil March 1, 1949, issued a Notification No. 2269/F, purporting to appoint a date under s. 4 (1) for the areas previously covered by the feudatory States including the Pallahara State, then merged in Orissa. That Notification is in these terms:
Such candidate continues to be contesting candidate for the purposes of the Act, notwithstanding his retirement from the contest under s. 55A (2).
When we come to the provisions of Part VI of the Act relating to disputes regarding election, we find that there is no definition given in s. 79 of the expression "
candidate " and " returned candidate " to be found therein. An election petition calling in question any election can be presented by any candidate at such election or any elector on one, or more of the grounds specified in ss. 100 (1) and 101 to the Election Commission and a petitioner in addition to calling in question the election of the returned candidate, or candidates may further claim a declaration that he himself or any other candidate has been duly elected. Where the petitioner claims such further declaration, he must join as respondents to his petition all the contesting candidates other than the petitioner and also any other candidate against whom allegations of any corrupt practices are made in the petition. The words " other than the petitioner " are meant to exclude the petitioner when he happens to be one of the contesting candidates who has been defeated at the polls and would not apply where the petition is filed for instance by an elector. An elector filing such a petition would have to join all the contesting candidates whose names were included in the list of contesting candidates prepared and published by the returning officer in the manner prescribed under s. 38, that is to say, candidates who were included in the list of validly nominated candidates and who had not withdrawn their candidature within the period prescribed. Such contesting candidates will have to be joined as respondents to such petition irrespective of the fact that one or more of them had retired from the contest tinder s. 55A (2). If the provisions of s. 82 which prescribes who shall be joined as respondents to the petition are not complied with, the Election Commission is enjoined under s. 85 of the Act to dismiss the petition and similar are the consequences of noncompliance with the provisions of s. 117 relating to deposit of security of costs. If the Election Commission however does not do so and accepts the petition, it has to cause a copy of the petition to be published in the official gazette and a copy thereof to be served by post on each of the respondents and then refer the petition to an election tribunal for trial. Section 90 (3) similarly enjoins the Election Tribunal to dismiss an election petition which does not comply with the provisions of s. 82 or s. 117 notwithstanding that it has not been dismissed by the Election Commission under s. 85. Section 90 (3) is mandatory and the Election Tribunal is bound to dismiss such a petition if an application is made before it for the purpose.
Turning now to s. 117, we find that it is a provision relating to the deposit of security for the costs of the petition. When a petitioner presents an election petition to the Election Commission under s. 81 he is to enclose with the petition a Government Treasury receipt showing that a deposit of one thousand rupees has been made by him either in a Government Treasury or in the Reserve Bank of India in favour of the Secretary to the Election Commission as security for the costs of the petition. The Government Treasury receipt must show that such deposit has been actually made by him either in a Government Treasury or in the Reserve Bank of India; it must also show that it has been so made in favour of the Secretary to the Election Commission and it must further show that it has been made as security for the costs of the petition. These are the three requirements of the section which have to be fulfilled. The question, however, arises whether the words " in favour of the Secretary to the Election Commission " are mandatory in character so that if the deposit has not been made in favour of the Secretary to the Election Commission as therein specified the deposit even though made in a Government Treasury or in the Reserve Bank of India and as security for the costs of the petition would be invalid and of no avail. If, for instance, the petitioner made the deposit either in a Government Treasury or in the Reserve Bank of India in favour of the Election Commission itself and obtained a Government Treasury receipt in regard to the same, could it be contended that in spite of such a deposit having been made, the said Government Treasury receipt was not in conformity with the requirements of s. 117 and the petitioner could be said not to have complied with the requirements of that section so as -to involve a dismissal of his petition under s. 85 or s. 90 (3) ?
The extreme case illustrated above has been taken by us only in order to demonstrate to what lengths a literal compliance with the provisions of s. 117 can be pushed. The petition is to be presented to the Election Commission, the security for the costs of the petition has to be given to the Election Commission and s. 121 provides for an application to be made in writing to the Election Commission for payment of costs by the person in whose favour the costs have been awarded and yet, even though the deposit may have been made by a petitioner in favour of the Election Commission and a Government Treasury receipt evidencing the same be enclosed along with his petition the provisions of s. 117 of the Act can be said not to have been complied with merely because the deposit was made in favour of the Election Commission and not in favour of the Secretary to the Election Commission. The relationship between the Election Commission on the one hand and the Secretary to the Election Commission on the other need not be scrutinized for the purposes of negativing this contention. It is enough to say that such a contention has only got to be stated in order to be negatived. It would be absurd to imagine that a deposit made either in a Government Treasury or in the Reserve Bank of India in favour of the Election Commission itself would not be sufficient compliance with the provisions of s. 117 and would involve a dismissal of the petition under s. 85 or s. 90 (3). The above illustration is sufficient to demonstrate that the words " in favour of the Secretary to the Election Commission " used in s. 117 are directory and not mandatory in their character. What is of the essence of the provision contained in s. 11.7 is that the petitioner should furnish security for the costs of the petition, and should enclose along with the petition a (Government Treasury receipt showing that a deposit of one thousand rupees has been made by him either in a Government Treasury or in the Reserve Bank of India, is at the disposal of the Election Commission to be utilised by it in the manner authorised by law and is under its control and payable on a proper application being made in that behalf to the Election Commission or to any person duly authorised by it to receive the same, be he the Secretary to the Election commission or any one else. If, therefore it can be shown by evidence led before the Election Tribunal that the government Treasury receipt or the chalan which was obtained by the petitioner and enclosed by him along with his petition presented to the Election Commission was such that the Election Commission could on a necessary application in that behalf be in a position to realise the said sum of rupees one thousand for payment of the costs to the successful party it would be sufficient compliance with the requirements of s. 117. No such literal compliance with the terms of s. 117 is at, all necessary as is contended for on behalf of the appellant before us. As regards the amendment of a petition by deleting the averments and the prayer regarding the declaration that either the petitioner or an other candidate has been. duly elected, so as to cure lie defect of nonjoinder of the necessary parties as respondents, we may only refer to our judgment * about Io be delivered in Civil Appeal No. 76 of 1958, where the question is discussed at considerable length. Suffice it to say here that the Election Tribunal has no power to grant such an amendment, be it by way of withdrawal or abandonment of a part of the claim or otherwise, once, an Election Petition has been presented to the Election (commission claiming such further declaration. Considering Civil Appeal No. 763 of 1957 in the light of the observations made above, we find that sundararaja Pillai whose name was included in the list of contesting candidates prepared and published by the returning officer under s. 38 but who retired from the contest under s. 55A (2) before the commencement of the poll was included in the expression "	Total Judgement
