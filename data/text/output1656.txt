N. C. Chatterjee, S. N. Andley, J. B. Dadachanji and Rameshwar Nath, for the appellants.
In this view the High Court rejected the application. The only question for our decision is as regards the legislative competence of the State Legislature of Punjab to enact this statute. Though a reference under Entry 7 of the Concurrent List of the 7th Schedule of the Constitution was made in the respondent's written statement no reliance appears to have been placed on this entry in the High Court nor has it been relied on before us by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent and it is quite clear that the impugned Act cannot fall within Item 7 of the Concurrent List which is in these terms:" Contracts, including partnership, agency, contracts of carriage, and other special forms of contracts, but not including contracts relating to agricultural land ". It is common ground before us that the Act must be held to be within the legislative competence of the Punjab State Legislature only if in pith and substance it fell within Item 62 of the State List and if it did not so fall it must be held to be beyond the State Legislature's competence.

S. M. Sikri, Advocate-General for the State of Punjab, N. S. Bindra and D. Gupta, for the respondent. 1960. September 13. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAs GUPTA J.-This appeal is against the judgment of the High Court of Punjab rejecting the appellant's application under Art. 226 of the Constitution. In this application the appellants who had been carrying on the business of commission agents in Forward Contracts at Ludhiana alleged that the Punjab Forward Contracts Tax Act, 1951 (Punjab Act No. VII of 1951), was ultra vires the powers conferred upon the State Legislature and prayed for a declaration that the Act and the notification made and the rules promulgated thereunder by the respondent, State of Punjab, were void. There was a further prayer for directing the State of Punjab by a writ of mandamus or other appropriate writ to allow the petitioners to carry on the business of Forward Contracts or as commission agents in Forward Contracts unrestricted by the provisions of the above-mentioned Act and the rules thereunder And not to enforce the Act.
The respondent's case as made in para. 5 of its written- statement was that " the impugned Act is not ultra vires the State Legislature. It is a law with respect to the matters enumerated in& Entry 62 of the State List read with Entry No. 7 of the Concurrent List of the 7th Schedule." The High Court held that:-
Assuming however that the definition is wide enough to include wagering contracts, the question arises whether the portion of the Act which would then be valid is severable from the portion which would remain invalid. One of the rules approved by this Court in R. M. D. Chamarbaugwala v. The Union of India (1), for deciding this question was laid down in these words:-
A second rule was that if "the valid and invalid parts of a statute are independent and do not form part of a scheme but what is left after omitting the invalid portion is so thin and truncated as to be in substance different from what it was when it emerged out of the legislature, then also it will be rejected in its entirety. "
so thin and truncated as to be in substance different from what it was when it emerged out of the legislature ". The respondent's contention that the statute should be hold to be valid in respect of wagering contracts even though invalid as regards other forward contracts must therefore also be rejected.	Precedent
If the impugned Act provides for a tax on betting and gambling then and then only it can come within Item 62. The Act provides for the levy of a tax on forward contracts and it has defined " forward contract" in s. 2 in these words:
Dealer " is defined in the same section to mean " any person, firm, Hindu Joint family or limited concern, including an arhti or " chamber " or association formed for the purpose of conducting business in forward contracts, who conducts such business in the course of trade in the State either on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person, arhti, "chamber" or association". ,Sale" is defined to mean "the final, settlement in respect of an agreement to sell goods mentioned in a forward contract, and it shall be deemed to have been completed on the date originally fixed in the forward contract for this purpose or any other date on which the final settlement is made ". Section 4 is the charging section and provides for a levy on the business in forward contracts of a dealer a tax at such rates as the Government may by notification direct. Section 5 lays down that every dealer shall be liable to pay tax under this Act as long as he continues his business in forward contracts. Section 6 prohibits any dealer from carrying on business in forward contracts unless he has been registered and possesses a registration certificate. Section 7 deals with the mode of payment of the tax and for submission of returns while s. 8 provides for assessment of the tax. As the term " forward contract " has been defined in the statute itself we have to forget for the purpose of deciding the present question any other notion about what a "forward contract" means. For the purpose of this statute every agreement for sale of goods on a future date is not a "
is the intention of the legislature that.is the determining factor. The test to be applied is whether the legislature would have enacted the valid part if it had known that the rest of the statute is invalid."	Section
While it might happen in fact that an association would be formed for the purpose of conducting business in wagering contract, it is hardly likely that the Legislature would take upon itself the task of openly permitting and recognizing such associations. These, in our opinion, are good reasons for thinking that the Legislature did not contemplate wagering contracts at all in defining " forward contract" in the way it did.
Our conclusion therefore is that the impugned statute does not fall within Item 62 of the State List and that it is beyond the legislative competence of the State Legislature. The appellants were therefore entitled to appropriate reliefs as prayed for in their petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution.
We therefore allow this appeal, set aside the order of the High Court and direct that the petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution be allowed and declare that the Punjab Forward Contracts Tax Act No. VII of 1951 is void and unconstitutional as it is ultra vires the powers of the State Legislature, that the notification made under the rules promulgated by the respondent under this Act are also void and unconstitutional and that a mandamus do issue directing the respondent to allow the petitioners to carry on the business of forward contracts or as commission agents for forward contracts unrestricted by the provisions of the said Punjab Forward Contracts Tax Act No. VII of 1951 and the rules thereunder and not to enforce the provisions of this Act and the rules. The appellants will get their costs in this Court as also in the court below.
Appeal allowed.	Conclusion

As against this it is proper to note that the Constitution itself contemplated taxation on gambling " by State Legislatures. It is however one thing to tax gambling, and quite another thing for a Legislature to encourage gambling by asking persons to register themselves for-this purpose. The definition of a "
