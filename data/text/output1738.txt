CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION Civil Appeal No. 292 of 1958.
Appeal from the judgment and decree dated October 23, 1956, of the PEPSU (now Punjab) High Court in Regular Second Appeal No. 29 of 1954.
C. K. Daphtary, Solicitor-General of India, J. B.Dadachanji, Ravinder Narain and O. C. Mathur, for the appellants. S.M. Sikri, Advocate-General for the State of Punjab, N. S. Bindra and P.D. Menon, for the respondent. 1961. July 28. Judgment of the Court was delivered by HIDAYATULLAH, J.-The only question in this appeal, with certificate under Art. 133(1)(c) of the Constitution, against the judgment and decree of' the High Court of Patiala and East Punjab States Union., is whether the levy of royalty at Rs. 50 per one lakh bricks under a Robkar issued by the Ijlas-i-Khas (Council of Regency), Patiala State, on February 6, 1919, is valid.	Issue
The Appeal arises out of a suit filed by the present appellants in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Faridkot, for declaration and injunction. The, suit was dismissed by the trial Judge, but on appeal to the District Court, the decision was reversed. On. further appeal to the High Court, the decision of the Additional District Judge was set aside, and that of the trial Judge restored. In this appeal, the only point argued is whether the order of the Ijlas-i-Khas continues to be effective, after the enactment of the Finance Act, 1950. The suit was filed on May 13, 1952, for conjunction against notices of demand issued to the appellants from the Tehsil Office, Faridkot, on or about April 20, 1951. The learned Solicitor-General concedes that the appellants' claim must be confined to the period after April 1, 1950, from which date the Finance Act, 1950, began to operate. He states that prior to that date the law could not be considered to be invalid because of Art. 277, which saved taxes, duties, cesses or fees which were being levied in any State prior to the commencement of the Constitution. He also concedes that the Finance Act,, 1950, could not operate before April 1, 1950, and the question, therefore, is, what is the effect of the Finance Act, 1950, on the order impugned ? It may also be pointed out that the authority of the Regency Council to issue the impugned order and the validity,of that order, unless affected by any Indian law, are not called in question.	PetArg
The Finance Act, 1950, was passed to give effect to the financial proposals for the year commencing on April 1, 1950. Section 11 of' that Act extended, amongst others, the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944, to the whole of India including Part B States, except the State of Jammu and Kashmir. By s. 13(2), it was provided, inter alia, as follows :
39. Prior to the enactment of this consolidating Act, there were no less than 17 Acts dealing with different commodities, and in 1944, all those laws were repealed, and a consolidated Act was passed to cover all those Acts and to include certain new commodities. The effect of consolida- tion was not to codify the law in such a way as to repeal other acts, which were not specifically mentioned in the Schedule dealing with repeals. No negative provision to save other commodities from the operation of any existing local law was either expressly included or even contemplated in the Act. The result, therefore, is quite clear that the Robkar, under which the royalty was imposed cannot be said to be a law corresponding to the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944, and is, therefore, not within the repeal created by s. 13(2) of the Finance Act, 1950.
