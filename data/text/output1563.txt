The State Of Rajasthan And Ors vs Thakur Pratap Singh on 18 August, 1960	Case Title
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 231 of 1956. Appeal from the judgment and order dated September 11, 1953, of the Rajasthan High Court (Jaipur Bench) at Jaipur in Writ Application No. 141 of 1952.
1960. August 18. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by RAJAGOPALA AYYANGAR, J.-This appeal raises for consideration the constitutional validity of one paragraph of a notification issued by the State of Rajasthan under s. 15 of the Police Act, 1861 (V of 1861), under which " the Harijan " and " Muslim " inhabitants of the villages, in which an additional police force was stationed, were exempted from the obligation to bear any portion of the cost of that force.	Issue
It is stated that the inhabitants of certain villages in the district of Jhunjhunu in the State of Rajasthan, harboured dacoits and receivers of stolen property, and were besides creating trouble between landlords and tenants as a result of which there were serious riots in the locality in the course of which some persons lost their lives. The State Government therefore took action under s. 15 of the Police Act. This Section provides :	Facts
M. S. K. Sastri and T. M. Sen, for the appellants. The respondent did not appear.
The view here expressed by the learned Judges is, in our opinion, correct. Even if it be that the bulk of the members of the communities exempted or even all of them were law-abiding, it was not contended on behalf of the State that there were no peaceful and law-abiding persons in these 24 villages belonging to the other communities on whom the punitive levy had been directed to be made. In para 5(f) of the petition filed before the High Court the respondent had averred :	PetArg
The notification by which these provisions were invoked and which is impugned in these proceedings was in these terms:-
The answer to this by the State was in these terms:
It would be seen that it is not the case of the State, even at the stage of the petition before the High Court that there were no persons belonging to the other communities who were peace-loving and law-abiding, though it might very well be, that according to the State, a great majority of these other communities were inclined the other way. If so, it follows that the notification has discriminated against the law-abiding members of the other communities and in favour of the Muslim and Harijan communities, (assuming that every one of them was "peace-loving and law-abiding") on the basis only of " caste " or "religion ". If there were other grounds they ought to have been stated in the notification. It is plain that the notification is directly contrary to the terms of Art. 15(1) and that para 4 of the notification has incurred condemnation as violating a specific constitu- tional prohibition. In our opinion, the learned Judges of the High Court were clearly right in striking down this paragraph of the notification.	Precedent
Sub-section (6) is omitted as not relevant.
Then followed the names of the 24 villages. The respondent-Thakur Pratap Singh being an inhabitant of Baragaon-one of these 24 villages, moved the High Court of Rajasthan for the issue of a writ or direction under Act. 226 of the Constitution impugning the validity of s. 15 of the Police Act and in particular of sub-s. 5 thereof and of the notification and praying for appropriate reliefs. The High Court repelled the wider contentions urged regarding the invalidity of s. 15 of the Police Act in general as also of the powers conferred on the State Government to order the exemption of " any person or classes or sections of such inhabitants " from liability to bear the cost of the additional police force. But the learned Judges hold that Para 4 of the notification which exempted " Harijan and Muslim inhabitants of the villages " from the levy, was violative of the guarantee in Art. 15(1) of the Constitution against discrimination on the ground of caste or religion etc. which reads.	Section
The appeal fails and is dismissed. As the respondent has not appeared there will be no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.	Conclusion
