Shubnath Deogram vs Ram Narain Prasad & Ors on 8 October, 1959	Case Title
JUDGMENT 1960(1) SCR 953 The Judgment was delivered by SARKAR J. :
This section defines corrupt practices which invalidate an election. Being a penal section, it must be strictly construed. This hits at canvassing of votes for, or against, a candidate on grounds of religion. A may ask B to vote for him on the ground that A and B belong to the same religion. C may ask B to vote for A on the ground that both A and B profess the same religion, or C may ask B not to vote for D on the ground that D belongs to a religion different from that of B. These are direct appeals to religion as a ground of preference. But there may also be an appeal which indirectly but by necessary implication invites votes on grounds of religion. What is essential, therefore, is that the appeal should, expressly or by necessary implication, seek votes on grounds of religions affinity or religions conflict.	Issue
For the aforesaid reasons, I hold that Ex. I does not contain an appeal by the appellant for votes on grounds of religion.
In the result, the order of the High Court is set aside and the election petition is dismissed with costs.
ORDER OF COURT In accordance with the opinion of the majority this appeal is dismissed with costs.	Conclusion

This section is not obviously intended to prevent appeals in picturesque or metaphorical language drawing analogies from mythology, religion or folklore. When most of the voters are illiterate, the candidate or his agent can attract and enthuse the audience or drive home his points only by parables, similes or metaphors drawn particularly from religious lore which most of the people understand and appreciate. A distinction must, therefore, be drawn between canvassing on grounds of religion and seeking of votes in graphic or picturesque language with analogies from religious lore : to illustrate, a candidate may appeal to the electorate consisting of persons professing different religions, say Hindus, Mohammadans, Christians etc., to vote for him and say that he would sacrifice his life in the cause of his constituency just like Christ sacrificed his life to redeem the world. He may also say that like Rama, the virtuous, who killed Ravana, the rakshasa, the embodiment of evil, he would, if elected, put down corruption, nepotism and the like in Government. He may even say that he would sacrifice himself as a goat before Kali to being happiness and prosperity to his constituency. All those similes are drawn from religion, but they do not embody an appeal, directly or indirectly, to vote for the candidate on grounds of religion.Coming to the offending document, let us see whether it contains an appeal to vote on grounds of religion. The appeal was intended to be made to an electorate comprising or voters of many religions, though an appreciable part of it were Adibasis. The appeal might have been read at the meetings by persons who were not Adibasis to an audience which might or might not have contained Adibasis. The symbol of cock was allotted without objection by the Election Commissioner to Jharkhand Party, which admittedly consisted of member other than Adibasis. The appeal is couched in poetic and picturesque language. It opens with the statement that the symbol of the Jharkhand Party is the cock and the said symbol is printed on the box of the Party. It then exhorts the voters to put their votes in the said box with the cock symbol. Then there is the exhortation to the voters to open their eyes and recognize the box and its cock. Then comes the appeal by parable. The cock symbol on the box and the sacrificial cock are not kept distinct, and the address is made in a metaphorical language. If literally understood it means that the cock on the box sacrifices its life with pleasure to relieve the distress of the people, such as their stomach and head aches, and therefore it asks them to give if food in the shape of vote; and tells them that if no such food in given, the people will suffer eternal miseries. If literally understood, this part of the appeal does not convey any sense. On the other hand, if the metaphor involved in the poem is expanded, it can only mean that "I, the cock in the box", i.e., the candidate or the Party, will sacrifice his or its life for the cause of the constituency, just like the cock sacrificing its life for the happiness of the people; and, just like the people who suffer eternal miseries if the cock is not fed, the constituency will suffer if votes are not given for the candidate or the Party. It may be noticed that no specific mention of Adibasis or their religion is made in the document. At the worst the document is capable of two interpretations : the one gives it an understandable content, and the other imputes to it a confusion of ideas involving a corrupt practice. Under such circumstances, I would prefer to read the document in a way beneficial to the elected candidate and to uphold his election rather than to impute corrupt practice to him on doubtful considerations and set aside his election.There is also another aspect of the case and that is; what is the religion of the Adibasis ? They are a backward community and they do not appear to have any highly evolved religion. Presumably, they are all Hindus."
The peculiarity of the Hindu religion is its universality. Along with its worship of gods, goddesses, and even of trees and snakes, there exists vedant philosophy which raise man himself to Godhood." These Adibasis, who are Hindus, appease different spirits alleged to govern different diseases and misfortunes, by sacrifices, which range from a cock to a buffalo, depending upon the magnitude of the calamity expected to be averted. It is well-known that not only Adibasis but also many other backward communities in India sacrifice animals to appease spirits and deities. The animal which is sacrificed is not an object of veneration, but only a convenient or conventional sacrificial medium. It cannot, therefore, be said that any reference to a sacrificing bird or animal is a reference to religion. It would be rather enlarging the scope of the disqualification if we should hold that a reference to a sacrificial bird or animal is canvassing on a ground of religion of Adibasis; for, such sacrifices are common not only among the Adibasis but also among many other backward communities.
For the aforesaid reasons, I hold that Ex. I does not contain an appeal by the appellant for votes on grounds of religion.
In the result, the order of the High Court is set aside and the election petition is dismissed with costs.
