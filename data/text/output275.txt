Surendra Singh And Others vs The State Of Uttar Pradesh on 16 November, 1953	Case Title
CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 34 of 1953.	Issue
Appeal from the Judgment and Order dated the 5th January, 1953, of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad (Lucknow Bench), Lucknow (Kidwai and Bhargava JJ.) in Criminal Appeal Register No. 24 of 1952 and Capital Sentence Register No. 4 of 1952 arising out of the Judgment and Order dated the 19th January 1952, of the Court of the Sessions Judge, Sitapur, in Sessions Case No. 97 of 1951.
Jai Gopal Sethi (K. P. Gupta, with him) for the appellant. G.C. Mathur and Onkar Nath Srivastava for the respondent. 1953. November 16. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BOSE J.We have three appellants before us. All were prosecuted for the murder of one Babu Singh. Of these, Surendra Singh alone was convicted of the murder and was sentenced to death. The other two were convicted under section 225, Indian Penal Code. Each was sentenced to three years' rigorous imprisonment and to a fine of Rs.
The arguments covered a wide range but we intend to confine ourselves to the facts of this case and only deal with the narrower issues which arise here.	Facts
The rules required the judgment to be signed and dated at the time that it was pronounced. Their Lordships said:-	PetArg
We do not intend to construe these rules too technically because they are designed, as indeed are all rules, to fur- ther the ends of justice and must not be viewed too narrow- ly; nor do we desire to curtail the jurisdiction which the Privy Council point out is inherent in courts to make good inherent defects caused by accidents such as death. As this decision of the Judicial Committee was relied on in the arguments we will quote the passage which is relevant here. It is at page 295 of Firm Gokal Chand v. Firm Nand Ram(1). The facts are not the same as here because the judgment was actually delivered in open court and both the judges who constituted the Bench were present and concurred in it. But before it could be signed, one Judge went on leave. (1) A.I.R. 1938 P.C. 292.
In our opinion, a judgment within the meaning of these sections is the final decision of the court intimated to the parties and to the world at large by formal "pronouncement" or "delivery" in open court. It is a judicial act which must be performed in a judicial way. Small irregularities in the manner of pronouncement or the mode of delivery do not matter but the substance of the thing must be there :
Peacock C.J. pointed out at page 30:	Precedent
Delivery of judgment is a solemn act which carries with it serious consequences for the person or persons involved. In a criminal case it often means the difference between freedom and jail, and when there is a conviction with a sentence of imprisonment, it alters the status of a prisoner from an under-trial to that of a convict; also the term of his sentence starts from the moment judgment is delivered. It is therefore necessary to know with certainty exactly when these consequences start to take effect. For that reason rules have been drawn up to determine the manner in which and the time from when the decision is to take effect and crystal lise into an act which is thereafter final so far as the court delivering the judgment is concerned. Now these rules are not all the same though, they are designed to achieve the same result. The Criminal Procedure Code takes care of courts subordinate to the High Court. Section 366 and 424 deal with them. The High Courts have power to make their own rules. The power is now conferred, or rather continued, under article 225 of the Constitution. The Allahabad High Court framed its present set of Rules in 1952. They came into force on the 15th of September in that year. We are concerned with the following in Chapter VII dealing with the judgment and decree, namely rules 1.4. These rules provide for four different situations: (1) for judgments which are pronounced at once as soon as the case has been heard; (2) for those which are pronounced on some future date, (3) for judgments which are oral, and (4) for those which are written. These rules use the word "pro- nounced" in some places and "delivered" in others. Counsel tried to make capital out of this and said that a judgment had to be both "pronounced" and "delivered" and that they were two different things.
That was a civil case. This is a criminal one. But section 537 of the Criminal Procedure Code does much the same thing on the criminal side as sections 99 and 108 do on the civil. The principle underlying them is the same. But even after every allowance is made and every effort taken to avoid undue technicality the question still remains what is a judgment, for it is the "judgment" which decides the case and affects the rights and liberties of the parties; that is the core of the matter and, as the Privy Council say, the whole purpose of these rules is to secure certainty in the ascertainment of what the judgment was. The question as- sumes more importance than ever in a criminal case because of section 369 of the Criminal Procedure Code which provides that "Save as otherwise provided by this Code or by any other law for the time being in force or, in the case of a High Court, by the Letters Patent or other instrument constituting such High Court, no court, when it has signed its judgment, shall alter or review the same except to correct a clerical error."	Section
We do not agree with everything which fell from the learned Chief Justice and the other Judges in that case but, in our opinion, the passages given above embody the true rule and succinctly explain the reasons for it. As soon as the judgment is delivered, that becomes the operative pronouncement of the court. The law then provides for the manner in which it is to be authenticated and made certain. The rules regarding this differ but they do not form the essence of the matter and if there is irregularity in carrying them out it is curable. Thus, if a judgment happens not to be signed and is inadvertently acted on and executed, the proceedings consequent on it would be valid because the judgment, if it can be shown to have been validly delivered, would stand good despite defects in the mode of its subsequent authentication.
Our conclusion is that the judgment which Kidwa,i J. purported to deliver on 5th January, 1953, was not a valid judgment because the other member of the Bench died before it could be delivered.
The appeal is allowed and the order of the High Court which purports to be its judgment is set aside. As it is no longer possible for the Bench which heard the appeal and the confirmation proceedings to deliver a valid judgment we send the case back to the High Court for re-hearing and delivery of a proper judgment.
Appeal allowed.	Conclusion
CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 34 of 1953.
Appeal from the Judgment and Order dated the 5th January, 1953, of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad (Lucknow Bench), Lucknow (Kidwai and Bhargava JJ.) in Criminal Appeal Register No. 24 of 1952 and Capital Sentence Register No. 4 of 1952 arising out of the Judgment and Order dated the 19th January 1952, of the Court of the Sessions Judge, Sitapur, in Sessions Case No. 97 of 1951.
Jai Gopal Sethi (K. P. Gupta, with him) for the appellant. G.C. Mathur and Onkar Nath Srivastava for the respondent. 1953. November 16. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BOSE J.We have three appellants before us. All were prosecuted for the murder of one Babu Singh. Of these, Surendra Singh alone was convicted of the murder and was sentenced to death. The other two were convicted under section 225, Indian Penal Code. Each was sentenced to three years' rigorous imprisonment and to a fine of Rs.
200. All three appealed to the High Court at Allahabad (Lucknow Bench) and the appeal was heard on Filth December, 1952, by Kidwai and Bhargava JJ. Judgment was reserved. Before it could be delivered Bhargava J. was transferred to Allahabad. While there he dictated a, "judgment" purporting to do so on behalf of himself and his brother Judge, that is to say it purported to be a joint judgment : he used the pronoun "we" and not "I". He signed every page of the "judgment" as well as at the end but did not date it. He then sent this to Kidwai J. at Lucknow. He died on 24th December, 1962, before the "judgment" was delivered. After his death, on 5th January, 1953, his brother Judge Kidwai J. purported to deliver the "judgment" of the court. He signed it and dated it. The date he placed on it was 5th January, 1953, Bhargava J.'s signature was still there and anyone reading the judgment and not knowing the facts would conclude that Bhargava J. was a party to the delivery on 5th January, 1953. The appeal was dismissed and the sentence of death was confirmed. The question is whether this "judgment" could be validly delivered after the death of one of the two Judges who heard the appeal.
The arguments covered a wide range but we intend to confine ourselves to the facts of this case and only deal with the narrower issues which arise here.
Delivery of judgment is a solemn act which carries with it serious consequences for the person or persons involved. In a criminal case it often means the difference between freedom and jail, and when there is a conviction with a sentence of imprisonment, it alters the status of a prisoner from an under-trial to that of a convict; also the term of his sentence starts from the moment judgment is delivered. It is therefore necessary to know with certainty exactly when these consequences start to take effect. For that reason rules have been drawn up to determine the manner in which and the time from when the decision is to take effect and crystal lise into an act which is thereafter final so far as the court delivering the judgment is concerned. Now these rules are not all the same though, they are designed to achieve the same result. The Criminal Procedure Code takes care of courts subordinate to the High Court. Section 366 and 424 deal with them. The High Courts have power to make their own rules. The power is now conferred, or rather continued, under article 225 of the Constitution. The Allahabad High Court framed its present set of Rules in 1952. They came into force on the 15th of September in that year. We are concerned with the following in Chapter VII dealing with the judgment and decree, namely rules 1.4. These rules provide for four different situations: (1) for judgments which are pronounced at once as soon as the case has been heard; (2) for those which are pronounced on some future date, (3) for judgments which are oral, and (4) for those which are written. These rules use the word "pro- nounced" in some places and "delivered" in others. Counsel tried to make capital out of this and said that a judgment had to be both "pronounced" and "delivered" and that they were two different things.
We do not intend to construe these rules too technically because they are designed, as indeed are all rules, to fur- ther the ends of justice and must not be viewed too narrow- ly; nor do we desire to curtail the jurisdiction which the Privy Council point out is inherent in courts to make good inherent defects caused by accidents such as death. As this decision of the Judicial Committee was relied on in the arguments we will quote the passage which is relevant here. It is at page 295 of Firm Gokal Chand v. Firm Nand Ram(1). The facts are not the same as here because the judgment was actually delivered in open court and both the judges who constituted the Bench were present and concurred in it. But before it could be signed, one Judge went on leave. (1) A.I.R. 1938 P.C. 292.
The rules required the judgment to be signed and dated at the time that it was pronounced. Their Lordships said:-

Thus, if a judgment happens not to be signed and is inadvertently acted on and executed, the proceedings consequent on it would be valid because the judgment, if it can be shown to have been validly delivered, would stand good despite defects in the mode of its subsequent authentication.
After the judgment has been delivered provision is made for review. One provision is that it can be freely altered or amended or even changed completely without further formality, except notice to the parties and a rehearing on the point of change should that be necessary, provided it has not been signed. Another is that after signature L/B(D)2SCI-8 a review properly so called would lie in civil cases but none in criminal; but the review, when it lies, is only permitted on very narrow grounds. But in this case the mere fact that a Judge is dead and so cannot review his judgment does not affect the validity of the judgment which has already been delivered and has become effective. For this reason there is a distinction between judgments which have not been delivered and so have not become operative and those which have. In the former case, the alteration is out of court. It is not a judicial act. It is only part of a process of reaching a final conclusion; also there is no formal public declaration of the Judges' mind in open court and consequently there is no "judgment' which can be acted upon. But after delivery the alteration cannot be made without notice to the parties and the proceeding must take place in open court, and if there is no alteration there is something which is final and conclusive and which can at once be acted upon. The difference is this. In the one case, one cannot know, and it would be against public policy to enquire, whether the draft of a judgment is the final conclusion of the Judge or is only a tentative opinion subject to alteration and change. In the second case, the Judge has publicly declared his mind and cannot therefore change it without notice to the parties and without hearing them afresh when that is necessary; and if there is no change the judgment continues in force. By change we mean an alteration of the decision and not merely the addition or subtraction of part of the reasoning.
Our conclusion is that the judgment which Kidwa,i J. purported to deliver on 5th January, 1953, was not a valid judgment because the other member of the Bench died before it could be delivered.
The appeal is allowed and the order of the High Court which purports to be its judgment is set aside. As it is no longer possible for the Bench which heard the appeal and the confirmation proceedings to deliver a valid judgment we send the case back to the High Court for re-hearing and delivery of a proper judgment.
1953. November 23. BOSE J.The order for stay dated the 25th May, 1953, has now expended itself. The death sentence cannot be carried out as there is no valid decision of the appeal and no valid confirmation. The position regarding that is as it was when the appeal was, made to the High Court. The second and the third appellants will surrender to their bail as they are now relegated to the position which they occupied when the appeal was filed in the High Court.
Appeal allowed.	Total Judgement
