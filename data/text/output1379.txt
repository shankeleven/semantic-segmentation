Pritam Singh Safe&, for the appellant.	Issue
N. S. Bindra and T. M. Sen, for the respondent. 1959. April 21. The Judgment of the Court was delivered,by KAPUR, J.-This is an appeal by special leave against the judgment and order of the High Court of PEPSU passed in revision'. The appellant was a sub-Inspector of Police who at the relevant time was the Station House Officer in-charge Shehna police station in the erstwhile PEPSU State. He was convicted under s. 193, Indian Penal Code, by a First Class Magistrate and his appeal to the Sessions Judge, Patiala, was dismissed except as to sentence. He took a revision to the PEPSU High Court but that was also dismissed.
This appeal has arisen in the following circumstances: One Surjit Singh, s/o Risaldar Waryam Singh, was arrested on September 25, 1953, at Barnala in PEPSU State by the Police Inspector Jaswant Singh. He was kept in the lock-up at Barnala and on the following day his custody was handed over to the appellant and he was taken to Shehna and was kept in custody-it is not clear under what section-in the police station lock- up at Shehna. Surjit Singh was there kept in custody from September 26, 1953, till October 10, 1953, when at about 10 p.m., he was surreptitiously removed to Police Station Dialpur and then to Police Post Hamirgarh and from there was taken to Police Station Baga Purana in Ferozepur District, of the then Punjab. An application under s. 491 of the Criminal Procedure Code and under Art. 226 of the Constitution was made for a writ of Habeas Corpus and Mandamus in the High Court of PEPSU. In that petition it was alleged that Surjit Singh was being kept in unlawful custody without any charge being made and without obtaining a remand by a Magistrate. In reply to this, an affidavit dated October 13, 1953, was filed by the appel. lant in which he stated that Surjit Singh had association with notorious dacoits; that he, the appellant, had never taken him into custody at any time; that the said Surjit Singh was absconding and had not been arrested in spite of the best efforts of the police; that at the time of the making of the affidavit he was not in the appellant's custody and that it was incorrect that Inspector Jaswant Singh had ever entrusted Surjit Singh to his (appellant's) custody. He also stated that no petition had been brought to him nor had he received any telegram in connection with the custody of Surjit Singh. This affidavit was affirmed as follows:-
As both the parties admitted before the High Court that Surjit Singh was not in the custody of the appellant the petition was dismissed. On November 9, 1953, the brother of Surjit Singh made an application under s. 476, Criminal Procedure Code, for the prosecution of Inspector Jaswant Singh and the appellant for perjury under s. 193, Indian Penal Code, in that they had filed false affidavits. This matter was heard by another learned Judge of that Court who ordered the prosecution of the appellant and directed the Registrar of the High Court to file a complaint which was filed. The complaint was taken cognizance of by the First Class Magistrate at Patiala who convicted the appellant and sentenced him to nine months' imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 300/- and in default to undergo simple imprisonment for two months. The appellant took an appeal to the Sessions Judge, Patiala, who confirmed the order of conviction but reduced the sentence to one of three months' simple imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 50 and in default one month's simple imprisonment, a revision against this order was dismissed in limine by the Chief Justice although he gave reasons for dismissing it. The appellant then obtained special leave from this Court.	Facts
On behalf of the appellant the first contention raised was that the appellant was not bound to file an affidavit and therefore he could not be convicted under s. 193, Indian Penal Code, because his case did not fall under s. 191, Indian Penal Code. In support of his contention he relied upon the Rules of the PEPSU High Court framed for the purpose of proceedings under Art. 226 and s. 491(2), Criminal Procedure Code, for the issuing of writs of Habeas Corpus. He also referred to the Rules made by that Court for the issuing of writs of Mandamus, Prohibition, Quo Warranto and Certiorari under Art. 226 and submitted that there was no Rule in the former, i.e., for writ of Habeas Corpus requiring a return to be made on behalf of the res- pondent to be sup-ported by an affidavit whereas in the latter, i.e., issuing of writs of Mandamus etc. an affidavit was necessary and therefore it was submitted that s. 191 was inapplicable. Rule 2 of the Rules of the Court required that when a Judge was of the opinion that prima facie case had been made out for granting the application a rule nisi was to issue calling upon the person or persons against whom the order was sought, to appear before the Court and to show cause why such an order should not be made. As has been pointed out in Greene v. Home Secretary (1) which was a case under Reg. 18-B of the Defence of the (1) [1942] A.C. 284, 302.	RespArg
(2) [1942] A.C. 284, 302.	Precedent
Realm Act the whole object of proceedings for a writ of Habeas Corpus is to make them expeditious, to keep them as free from technicality as possible and to keep them as simple as possible. " The incalculable value of Habeas Corpus is that it enables the immediate determination of the right to the appellant's freedom " (Lord Wright). When there is no question of fact to be examined or determined no affidavit is needed. As soon as there emerges a fact into which the Court feels it should enquire the necessity for an affidavit arises. Ordinarily an affidavit may not be necessary in making the return if the detention is under orders of the detaining authority in exercise of its plenary discretion as in Liversidge v. Anderson (1) and in Greene's case (2) or a person is detained under the orders of a Court. But where the detention is, as it was in the present case, it becomes necessary for the detaining authority to justify its action by disclosing facts which would show to the satisfaction of the Court that the custody is not impro- per. Where the prisoner says " I do not know why I have been detained, I have done no wrong ", it is for the detaining authority to justify the custody. When issues of fact are raised and the actions of the police officers, as in the present case, are expressly challenged and facts are set out which if unrebutted and unexplained would be sufficient for the writ to issue, an affidavit becomes necessary. It cannot be said therefore that in the present case the appellant was not legally bound to place facts and circumstances before the Court to justify the detention of Surjit Singh and, this could be done by an affidavit. Section 4 of the Oaths Act lays down the authority to administer oaths and affirmations and it prescribes the courts and persons authorised to administer by themselves or by their officers empowered in that behalf oaths and affirmations in discharge of the duties or in exercise of the powers imposed upon them and they are, all courts and persons having by law the authority to receive evidence. Section 5 prescribes the persons by whom oaths or affirmations must be (1) [1942] A.C. 206.
made and they include all witnesses, i. e., all persons who' may lawfully be required to give evidence by or before any court. These two sections show that the High Court or its officers were authorised to administer the oath and as the appellant was stating facts as evidence before the High Court he had to make the oath or affirmation and was bound to state the truth. Section 14 of that Act is in the following words:	Section
In our opinion the appellant has been rightly convicted and we would therefore dismiss this appeal.
Appeal dismissed.	Conclusion
