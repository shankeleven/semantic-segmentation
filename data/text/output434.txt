Appeal by Special Leave from the Judgment and Decree dated the 27th day of January, 1949, of the High Court of Judicature at Patna in Appeal from Appellate Decree No. 690 of 1947 against the Decree dated the 13th January, 1947, of the Court of the District Judge, Bbagalpur, in Title Appeal No. 161 of 1946 arising out of the Judgment and Decree dated the 25th July, 1946, of the Court of the 1st Additional Subordinate Judge, Bhagalpur, in Title Suit No. 80 of 1945. N.C. Chatterjee, (A. N. Sinha and S. P. Verma, ,with him) for the appellant.
Murtaza Fazl Ali and Rajinder Narain, for respondent No. I. 1954. April 14. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BOSE J.-This is a plaintiff's appeal in a suit for re- demption of what the plaintiff calls a mortgage dated 15th April, 1930. The only question for determination is whether this is a mortgage by conditional sale or a sale out and out with a condition of repurchase. If the former the plaintiff succeeds. If the latter he is out of Court.
The property covered by the disputed deed belonged to one Bijai Tanti who died leaving a widow Mst. Phaguni and two sons Siban Tanti and Chander Tanti. On 25th May, 1922, Siban Tanti alone executed a simple mortgage in favour of the second defendant for Rs.
25. Then on 6th May, 1927, Siban Tanti, Chander Tanti and Mst. Phaguni mortgaged the same property to the first defendant for Rs. 250. This was also a simple mortgage. After this came the transaction in suit dated 15th April, 1930. The same three persons executed the disputed deed. This was in favour of the first defendant. The consideration mentioned in the deed is Rs. 634-10-0 due on the second mortgage and Rs. 65-6-0 taken in cash to enable the executants to meet the expenses of certain commutation proceedings under section 40 of the Bihar Tenancy Act in respect of this very land.

Murtaza Fazl Ali and Rajinder Narain, for respondent No. I. 1954. April 14. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BOSE J.-This is a plaintiff's appeal in a suit for re- demption of what the plaintiff calls a mortgage dated 15th April, 1930. The only question for determination is whether this is a mortgage by conditional sale or a sale out and out with a condition of repurchase. If the former the plaintiff succeeds. If the latter he is out of Court.
The property covered by the disputed deed belonged to one Bijai Tanti who died leaving a widow Mst. Phaguni and two sons Siban Tanti and Chander Tanti. On 25th May, 1922, Siban Tanti alone executed a simple mortgage in favour of the second defendant for Rs.

After this came the transaction in suit dated 15th April, 1930. The same three persons executed the disputed deed. This was in favour of the first defendant. The consideration mentioned in the deed is Rs. 634-10-0 due on the second mortgage and Rs. 65-6-0 taken in cash to enable the executants to meet the expenses of certain commutation proceedings under section 40 of the Bihar Tenancy Act in respect of this very land.
The second defendant sued on his mortgage of 1922 but did:
extraneous and irrelevant considerations. Difficulty only arises in the border line cases where there is ambiguity. Unfortunately, they form the bulk of this kind of transaction.
Because of the welter of confusion caused by a multitude of conflicting decisions the Legislature stepped in and amended section 58(c) of the Transfer of Property Act. Unfortunately that brought in its train a further conflict of authority. But this much is now clear. If the sale and agreement to repurchase are embodied in separate documents, then the transaction cannot be a mortgage whether the documents are, contemporaneously executed or not. But the converse does not hold good, that is to say, the mere fact that there is only one document does not necessarily mean that it must be a mortgage and cannot be a sale. If the condition of repurchase is embodied in the document that effects or purports to effect the -sale, then it is a matter for construction which was meant. The Legislature has made a clear cut classification and excluded transactions embodied in more than one document from the category of mortgages, therefore it is reasonable to suppose that persons who, after the amendment, choose not to use two documents, do not intend the transaction to be a sale, unless they displace that presumption by clear and express words; and if the conditions of section 58(c) are fulfilled, then we are of opinion that the deed should be construed as a mortgage.
The document with which we are concerned, Exhibit A, is in the following terms and our first duty is to construe the language used and see whether it is ambiguous. (We have paragraphed the document for convenience of construction and have omitted unnecessary words).
(3) " Therefore, we the executants declare.... that we sold -and vended the properties,detailed below on condition (given below) for a fair and just price of Rs. 700 "
(5) " and we put the said vendee in possession and occupation of the vended property detailed below and made him an absolute proprietor in our places." (6) " If we, the executants, shall repay the consideration money to the said vendee within two years............ the property vended under this deed of conditional sale attached shall come in exclusive possession and occupation of us the executants."
(7) " If we do not pay the same, the said vendee shall remain in possession and occupation thereof, generation after generation, and he shall appropriate the produce thereof."
(8) " We, the executants, neither have nor shall have any objection whatsoever in respect of the vended property and the consideration money. Perchance if we do so it shall be deemed null and void in Court."
(10) " Therefore we, the executants......... have executed this deed of conditional sale so that it may be of use in future."
In our opinion, this language is not free from difficulty and is ambiguous. The deed purports to be a sale and has the outward form of one but at the same time it calls itself a"conditional sale." It has,however, no clause for retransfer and instead says (clause 6) that if the executants pay the money within two yeas, the property "
is fulfilled.
We next turn to the conditions. The ones relevant to the present purpose are contained in clauses (6) and (7). Both are ambiguous, but we have already said that on a fair construction clause (6) means that if the money is paid within the two years then the possession will revert to the executants with the result that the title which is already in them will continue to reside there. The necessary consequence of that is that the ostensible sale becomes void. Similarly, clause- (7), though clumsily worded, can only mean that if the money is not paid, then the sale shall become absolute. Those are not the actual words used but, in our opinion, that is a fair construction of their meaning when the document is read as a whole. If that is what they mean, as we hold they do, then the matter falls squarely within the ambit of section 58(c).
Now, as we have already said, once a transaction is embodied in One document and not two and once its terms are covered by section 58(c) then it must be taken to be a mortgage by conditional sale unless there are express words to indicate the contrary, or, in a case of ambiguity, the attendant circumstances necessarily lead to the opposite conclusion. There are no express words here which say that this is not a mortgage but there is ambiguity, so we must probe further. The respondents, who claim that this is a sale and not a mortgage, rely on the following circumstances. They are all culled from the deed itself First, they point to clause (5) which says that the transferee has been made the absolute proprietor in place of the executants. Those, they say, are the operative words and point to an out and out transfer of title.
