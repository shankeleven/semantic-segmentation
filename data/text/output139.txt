Issue
CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 38 of 1950. Appeal from the judgment and order of the High Court of Patiala (Teja Singh C.J., and Gurnam Singh J.) dated 5th October, 1950, in Criminal Appeal No. 28 of 1950, affirming the conviction and sentence of the appellant by the Sessions Judge of Sangrur.
The prosecution story is a somewhat long and complicated one, but ignoring unnecessary details, the material facts may be shortly stated as follows :--	Facts
Gopal Singh and Kartar Singh, for the appellant. Narinder Singh, Advocate General for the Patiala and East Punjab States Union (Jindra Lal, with him) for the respond- ent.
It appears that the appellant was an Instructor in the Home Guards. and the rifle which he is said to have used had been given to him by his superior officer with 20 rounds of ammunition.
To support their version of the occurrence, the prosecu- tion examined 3 eye-witnesses whose evidence has been ac- cepted by both the courts below after careful scrutiny. The learned Sessions Judge acquitted the appellant of the second and third charges under section 307 of the Indian Penal Code, holding that there was no convincing evidence that the appellant intended to murder Jangit Singh and the other 2 persons. He however convicted him of the first charge under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to death, which sentence was later confirmed by the High Court. The learned counsel for the appellant had very little to argue on the merits of the case, but he seriously contended that there had been a misjoinder of charges which could not be tried together under the law, and the illegality so committed had vitiated the whole trial of the appellant. It appears that in the High Court, the line of argument on this point was somewhat different from the line adopted in this court. What was stressed in that court seems to have been that the three incidents in respect of which the appellant was charged not having happened in the course of the same transaction, they could not have been properly made the subject of one trial, and for this contention reliance was placed mainly on section 235 (1)of the Criminal Procedure Code, which provides that "if, in one series of acts so connected together as to form the same transaction, more offences than one are committed by the same person, he may be at one trial for, every such offence." It should be noted that that section is only one of the exceptions to the general rule laid down in section 233 of the Code that for every distinct offence, there shall be a separate charge and every such charge shall be tried separately. In this court, no reference was made to section 235, but the argument was confined to the question as to whether the present case falls within another exception of section 23'3 which is contained in section 234 (1) which runs as 'follows :-
It was argued before us that even though only 3 charges have been framed against the appellant, he has in fact been tried for 4 offences and not 3. The 4 offences are said to be these :--	PetArg
The learned counsel contended that the fact that the appellant has been acquitted of the last 3 offences and convicted only of the first offence was immaterial to the point raised by him, and we have only to see whether all the offences mentioned above could be properly tried together. In our opinion, the short reply to this contention is that the second charge which relates to the appellant firing at Kartar Singh and Jangir Singh is not a charge with respect to 2 offences but is a charge with respect to one offence only. The evidence adduced by the prosecution shows that the appellant fired only one bullet. The word "offence" has been defined in the Criminal Procedure Code as meaning "any act or omission made punishable by any law for the time being in force". There seems to be nothing wrong in law to regard the single act of firing by the appellant as one offence only. On the other hand, we think that it would be taking an extremely narrow and arti- ficial view to split it into 2 offences. There are several reported cases in which a similar view has been taken, and in our opinion they have not been incorrectly decided. In Queen Empress v. Raghu Rai(1), where a person stole several bullocks from the same herdsman at the same time, it was held that only one offence had been committed. In Promotha Nath Ray v. King Emperor(2), it was held that misappropria- tion in regard to several account books constituted only one offence. In Johan Subarna v. King EmPeror(3), it was held that when an attempt to cheat a number of men by speaking to them in a body had been committed, one joint charge was valid. In Poonit Singh v. Madho Bhot (4), it was held that only one offence had been committed by a person who gave false information in one statement to the police against 2 persons. In Sudheendrakumar Ray v. Emperor(5), a person who was chased by 2 constables had fired at them several times, but it seems to have been rightly assumed that the firing did not constitute more than one offence, though the point was not specifically raised or decided. In our opinion, there is no substance in the point raised, though we should not be understood as laying down the wide proposition that in no case can a single act constitute more than one of- fence.	Precedent
The other points urged on behalf of the appellant before us were somewhat unsubstantial points relating to the merits of the case, which it is not usual for this court to allow to be raised in appeals by special leave.
In our opinion, this appeal is without merit, and it is accordingly dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
