CIVIL APPELATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 347 of 1955. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated April 20, 1955, of the Railway Rates Tribunal, Madras, in Complaint No. 2 of 1954.
H. N. Sanyal Additional Solicitor General of India, Niren De. P. C. Chatterjee and P. K. Ghosh, for the appellant. N. C. Chatterjee, J. P. Aggarwalla, B. K. B. Naidu and I. N. Shroff, for respondent No. 1.	Issue
B. K. Khanna and R . H. Dhebar, for respondent No. 2. 1960. February 9. Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS GUPTA, J.-When total charges payable in respect of goods traffic carried by a Railway are increased by the Railway Administration on the basis of terminals fixed by the Central Government in pursuance of s. 32 of the Indian Railways Act, has the Railway Rates Tribunal jurisdiction to investigate the reasonableness of the charge as thus increased ? That is the question raised in this appeal. The first respondent, the Upper Doab Sugar Mills Ltd., manu- factures sugar in its Mills situated at Shamli. The sugarcane needed as its raw material has to be brought by the Company from different places in the neighbourhood. It is in this connection that the appellant Railway Company's services are required. The Railway Company carries the sugarcane in trucks from several stations on its line, to Shamli. As the Mills premises are situated a short distance away from the station platform the Mills had at the very time when it started functioning, a siding agreement with the Roy Company so that the trucks carrying the sugarcane are ultimately brought into the Mills siding from where the unloading takes place. The nearest point of the Mills siding from the station platform at Shamli is about 100 to 150 ft. away. Tile Rly. loco-motives bring the sugarcane trucks to this point-pt. A in the Plan-after which the Mills makes its own arrangement for taking them inside the sidings. After several increases from time to time which it is not necessary to mention, the charges payable in respect of sugarcane carried in the Railway Company's trucks and brought by the Railway Company's locomotives up to the point A stood on September 30, 1953, at the following figures:-
In spite of this however the Railway Company did not levy any terminal charges in accordance with this rate up to September, 1953 and continued to charge at the rate mentioned above.
On August 1, 1953 the Railway Company issued a Local Rate Advice the relevant portion of which was in these terms :-	Facts
It is interesting in this connection to turn to som of the English decisions which seem to have impresses the members of the Tribunal. In Foster v G. E. Railway Co. (1), the Court had to consider certain sections of the Great Eastern Railway Company (Rates and Charges) Order Confirmation Act, 1891. Section 2 thereof provided that the maximum rate for conveyance is the maximum rate which the company may charge for the conveyance of merchandise by merchandise train; and, subject to the exceptions and provisions specified in the schedule includes the provisions of locomotive power and trucks by the company, and every other expense incidental to such conveyance not hereinafter provided for. Section 3 provides that the maximum station terminal is the maximum charge which the company may make to a trader for the use of the accommodation (exclusive of coal) provided and for the duties undertaken by the company for which no other provision is made in the schedule, at the terminal station for or in dealing with merchandise, as carriers thereof, before or after conveyance. Section 5 provides that the company may charge for the services for the following, or any of them, when rendered to a trader at his request or for his convenience, a reasonable sum, by way of addition to the tonnage rate, and services rendered by the Company, at or in connection with sidings not belonging to the Company. It was in connection with this scheme of the law that the Court had to consider where conveyance should be held to end. It was held that conveyance for the purpose of rates might or might not coincide with the contractual conveyance but that it could not be said as matter of law that it did. The point at which it ended would prima facie be the point at which the goods train detached and deposited the Trucks, but if they were so detached and deposited for the convenience of the railway company at a point short of that to which as conveyers they would be bound to take them for the purposes of delivery to a (1) (1920) K.B. 574.
distributing carrier in times when such carriers existed, a charge could not be made for haulage between these points.	Precedent
In each case a surcharge of annas 2 per rupee was added. Before this, however, on February 20, 1950, the Central Govt., had made an order under s. 32 of the Indian Railways Act, the relevant portion of which is in these words:-
Six pies per maund at each end, where the owners of the goods are required to do loading and unloading......."
schedule rate." The first being defined as rate fixed according to the class given to a commodity in the classification of goods and the second as " the rate lower than the maximum or class rate applied on a commodity basis.
station to station rate " in respect of goods will mean only a, charge payable for carriage of goods as may be made specially applicable to a specific commodity booked between two specified stations for the carriage of the same. This would not include any charge made in addition to the charge for carriage. It must therefore be held that the words of the Local Advice Order stating the new station to station rate as so much plus " so much for terminal charge " are not strictly accurate. The proper way of giving information to parties concerned would be to state the station to station rate as consisting of the amount mentioned in the first party only-the charge for carriage-and to make a separate announcement as regards terminal charge. This inaccuracy in expression cannot however affect the substance of the matter. The fact that the terminal charge was mentioned as a part of the station to station rate is no reason to think that standardized terminal charges were not being applied.
(b) Wagons will be handled by the Railway to and from the lines marked A and B in Plan No. 12-A hereinbefore referred to or such other point or length as may hereafter be fixed upon by mutual consent of the Firm and the Railway Administration in writing.
Note 1. The free time referred to above will be calculated in accordance with the rules in force from time to time as published in the Goods Traffic Books of the Railway Administration and wagons detained by the Firm over and above such free time shall be subject to payment of the demurrage charges laid down in such tariffs. Note 2. The Firm will arrange to band shunt wagons to and from the said length "A" with their own labour and the Railway Administration will not be responsible for any delay, loss or damage caused in consequence of the failure of the Firm to arrange for such band shunting. It is important to notice that cl. 13 mentions in definite and categorical Ianguage that freight is charged up to and from Shamli station. It is reasonable to read the " station " here as the " station platform ". When in clause 15 it is agreed that the " wagons will be hauled by the Railway to and from the lines marked A and B " nothing is said about any charge being made therefor. It is impossible to read into the words used in el. 15(b) an implication that carriage up to point A was being charged for. On a proper reading of these clauses we think it reasonable to hold that carriage up to the station platform only was being charged for. The haulage of, the trucks from the station platform to point A was thus necessarily a service rendered by the Railway Company in addition to the carriage and so was a terminal service.
As has already been noticed our legislature has thought fit to avoid the use of the word "conveyance" and has provided for maximum and minimum being prescribed for rates as defined in s. 3(13), viz., as charges for "
It is worth considering in this connection that the definition of " terminal charges " in the Indian Act is a verbatim reproduction of the definition appearing in the English Railway and Canals Traffic Act, 1888 and that only three years before the English Parliament passed that Act an English Court had held in Hall & Co. v. London, Brighton and South Coast Rly., Co. (2), that for the purposes of interpretation of section 51 of the London, Brighton, and South Coast Rly. Act, 1863 which did not include such a definition of terminal charges, the words " any service incidental to the duty or business of a carrier", does comprise providing such station accommodation and such sidings, and such weighing, checking and labelling as is incidental to the duty which they undertake, of collecting and dealing with the goods as carriers." It is reasonable to think that the English Parliament in defining " terminal charges " in the Railway and Canals Act, 1889 intended to give effect to this view that provision of station accommodation and sidings entitled the Railway Administration to levy " terminal charges." When the. Indian Legislature adopted the same definition in its own Act it is proper to think that it also was aware of the view taken in Hall's Case (2). This consideration fortifies the conclusion which we have already reached on an examination of the scheme of our own Act, apart from authorities, that the words " in respect of " used in s. 3(14) in the definition of (2) (1885) 15 K.B. 505.

Clause 5: (a) Wagons will be made over to the Firm and returned by the Firm in the form of certificate shown in Annexure A.

When this has been done, the wagons will be considered as made over to the Firm and the free time permissible under the rules will then commence. Similarly, wagons will be considered as returned to the Railway by the Firm as soon as they are placed at the line " B " referred to and the Station Master has been advised by the Firm This will de done by presentation of the outer foil with column filled in.
terminal charges " means " for the provision of and not "
terminal charges " within the meaning of the Railways Act and the proposed levy being in accordance with Government Notification` under s. 32 of the Act was nothing more than the application of standardized terminal charges.The Tribunal had therefore no jurisdiction to investigate the reasonableness or otherwise of the same and had no jurisdiction to reduce the same. The order made by the majority of the Tribunal cannot therefore be allowed to stand.
The order made by the Tribunal is therefore set aside. The application made under s. 41 in respect of this levy of Rs. 9.6 per 4 wheeler truck in addition to the carriage is rejected. The appeal is allowed with costs. Appeal allowed.	Conclusion
CIVIL APPELATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 347 of 1955. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated April 20, 1955, of the Railway Rates Tribunal, Madras, in Complaint No. 2 of 1954.

That is the question raised in this appeal. The first respondent, the Upper Doab Sugar Mills Ltd., manu- factures sugar in its Mills situated at Shamli.

It is in this connection that the appellant Railway Company's services are required. The Railway Company carries the sugarcane in trucks from several stations on its line, to Shamli.

In each case a surcharge of annas 2 per rupee was added. Before this, however, on February 20, 1950, the Central Govt., had made an order under s. 32 of the Indian Railways Act, the relevant portion of which is in these words:-
Six pies per maund at each end, where the owners of the goods are required to do loading and unloading......."
In spite of this however the Railway Company did not levy any terminal charges in accordance with this rate up to September, 1953 and continued to charge at the rate mentioned above.
On August 1, 1953 the Railway Company issued a Local Rate Advice the relevant portion of which was in these terms :-
schedule rate." The first being defined as rate fixed according to the class given to a commodity in the classification of goods and the second as " the rate lower than the maximum or class rate applied on a commodity basis.
station to station rate " in respect of goods will mean only a, charge payable for carriage of goods as may be made specially applicable to a specific commodity booked between two specified stations for the carriage of the same. This would not include any charge made in addition to the charge for carriage. It must therefore be held that the words of the Local Advice Order stating the new station to station rate as so much plus " so much for terminal charge " are not strictly accurate. The proper way of giving information to parties concerned would be to state the station to station rate as consisting of the amount mentioned in the first party only-the charge for carriage-and to make a separate announcement as regards terminal charge. This inaccuracy in expression cannot however affect the substance of the matter. The fact that the terminal charge was mentioned as a part of the station to station rate is no reason to think that standardized terminal charges were not being applied.
More important is the argument that the Central Government Notification fixing 6 pies per maund as the , terminal charge at each end, where loading and Upper unloading is done by the owner, should be interpreted as permitting the levy of such charges only if some service in addition to the carriage is being performed. This argument is based on a view of the definition of the word " terminals " in s. 3(14) that " terminals " means charges for certain services rendered. Acceptance of that view will undoubtedly justify a conclusion that in fixing " terminals " the Central Government only authorized the charges to be levied, on certain services in addition to carriage having been rendered. If thereafter it is found that no such services were rendered the conclusion that will follow is that levy- ing of a charge at the end where no such services were rendered was not levying of a "standardized terminal charge."
Assuming for the present, that on a proper interpretation of the definition of the word " terminals ", no terminal charge can be made unless some service in addition to the carriage of the goods is rendered, it is necessary to see whether the conclusion of two members of the Tribunal who formed the majority was correct in so far as they held that no such service was performed at the Shamli end. It is important to bear in mind that in so far as such a conclusion is a pure finding of fact this Court will not ordinarily interfere therewith. If however the conclusion is apparently vitiated by an error of law it becomes proper and desirable for this Court to consider what the correct finding would be on a correct appreciation of law. Both Shri L.M. Roy and Shri Subrahmanian proceeded on the basis that " the loaded cane specials are taken to point A in the map and then pushed inside, leaving them at the assisted siding. It is here that the conveyance ends and the terminal begins. Whatever services are rendered thereafter would be as carriers and are subject to separate charges in the form of terminals." The distinction between " conveyance " and duty as a "
Clause 5: (a) Wagons will be made over to the Firm and returned by the Firm in the form of certificate shown in Annexure A.
(b) Wagons will be handled by the Railway to and from the lines marked A and B in Plan No. 12-A hereinbefore referred to or such other point or length as may hereafter be fixed upon by mutual consent of the Firm and the Railway Administration in writing.
(c) As soon as wagons are placed at the line " A referred to, the Station Master will fill in columns 1, 2 and 3 of both foils of Annexure A, and obtain the Firm's signature in column 4 of the inner foil and make over the outer foil to the firm. When this has been done, the wagons will be considered as made over to the Firm and the free time permissible under the rules will then commence. Similarly, wagons will be considered as returned to the Railway by the Firm as soon as they are placed at the line " B " referred to and the Station Master has been advised by the Firm This will de done by presentation of the outer foil with column filled in.
The Station Master will then initial in column 5 of the outer foil, and fill in columns 5, 6, 7 and 8 of the inner foil and columns 6, 7 and 8 of the outer foil and recover the demurrage due.
Note 1. The free time referred to above will be calculated in accordance with the rules in force from time to time as published in the Goods Traffic Books of the Railway Administration and wagons detained by the Firm over and above such free time shall be subject to payment of the demurrage charges laid down in such tariffs. Note 2. The Firm will arrange to band shunt wagons to and from the said length "A" with their own labour and the Railway Administration will not be responsible for any delay, loss or damage caused in consequence of the failure of the Firm to arrange for such band shunting. It is important to notice that cl. 13 mentions in definite and categorical Ianguage that freight is charged up to and from Shamli station. It is reasonable to read the " station " here as the " station platform ". When in clause 15 it is agreed that the " wagons will be hauled by the Railway to and from the lines marked A and B " nothing is said about any charge being made therefor. It is impossible to read into the words used in el. 15(b) an implication that carriage up to point A was being charged for. On a proper reading of these clauses we think it reasonable to hold that carriage up to the station platform only was being charged for. The haulage of, the trucks from the station platform to point A was thus necessarily a service rendered by the Railway Company in addition to the carriage and so was a terminal service.
It is clear therefore that even on the assumption made that on the definition of the terminals in s. 3(14) no charges are payable unless certain services in addition to carriage are performed by the Railway Company, terminals were leviable in the present case at the Shamli end also and so the foundation for the argument that Rs. 4.11 being charged at the Shamli end was not really a terminal charge but some other charge in the garb of terminal disappears.
It is interesting in this connection to turn to som of the English decisions which seem to have impresses the members of the Tribunal. In Foster v G. E. Railway Co. (1), the Court had to consider certain sections of the Great Eastern Railway Company (Rates and Charges) Order Confirmation Act, 1891.

Section 3 provides that the maximum station terminal is the maximum charge which the company may make to a trader for the use of the accommodation (exclusive of coal) provided and for the duties undertaken by the company for which no other provision is made in the schedule, at the terminal station for or in dealing with merchandise, as carriers thereof, before or after conveyance. Section 5 provides that the company may charge for the services for the following, or any of them, when rendered to a trader at his request or for his convenience, a reasonable sum, by way of addition to the tonnage rate, and services rendered by the Company, at or in connection with sidings not belonging to the Company.
