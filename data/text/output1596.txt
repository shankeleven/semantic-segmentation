provision otherwise " he will have to satisfy the court that the " provision otherwise " has been fully made and the court will be in a position to investigate into the matter. This, however, does not mean that if the insurer does not want to take advantage of s. 9 of the Act he can say without submitting to the terms of that section that he has made " provision otherwise ", because the deposit which is made under s. 7 is more than all his liabilities of the insurance business that he has closed. It is urged that it is hard, for example, on an insurer who has a large deposit and whose liabilities are small that he should not be able to fall back on his deposit for the purposes of s. 2D. We do not, however, see any hardship in a case of this kind, for if it is a fact that the deposit of the insurer is large and his liabilities are small he can always take advantage of s. 9 of the Act and submit to an investigation by the court and take back his deposit after depositing the small sum required to meet his liabilities. We are, therefore, of opinion that when s. 2D speaks of satisfaction or "	RespArg
1960. May 4. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by WANCHOO, J.-This is an appeal on a certificate granted by the Madras High Court. The appellant Company had -been carrying on various classes of insurance business other than life insurance after its incorporation in September, 1941. On October 15, 1956, an extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders of the Company passed a resolution by which all its insurance business was to cease forthwith and no further policies of insurance of any kind were to be issued thereafter. It was also resolved that no application should be made for renewal of the certificate granted under s. 3 of the Insurance Act, No. IV of 1938 (hereinafter called the Act), and that thence forward the Company should only carry on the business of money-lending as a loan-Company and also to do investment business. In consequence of these resolu- tions, the Company informed the Controller of Insurance in December, 1956, that it was not applying for renewal of its registration for carrying on the business of insurance. In May, 1957, the Controller wrote to the Company that its certificates for carrying on insurance business would be deemed to be cancelled from July 1, 1957, and the cancellation was notified in the Gazette of India. It appears that the Government of India had been receiving complaints against the Company. Consequently on July 17, 1957, the Government of India passed an order under s. 33 of the Act directing the Controller of Insurance to investigate the affairs of the Company and to submit a report. Thereupon the Controller appointed Messrs. Fraser and Ross to act as auditors to assist him in the investigation. The Company was informed of this order in September 1957. Thereupon it wrote to the Controller that no order under s. 33 of the Act could be passed against it, as it had closed its business of insurance and the order in question was without jurisdiction. The Controller sent a reply to this communication and pointed to the provisions of s. 2D of the Act in justification of the order. Thereupon the Company made an application under Art. 226 of the Constitution in the Madras High Court. Two main contentions were raised by it in the petition. In the first place it was submitted that the Company having closed all its insurance business no order could be passed against it under s. 33. as that section only applied to companies actually carrying on the business of insurance and that in any case no such order could be passed even with the help of s. 2D of the Act. In the second place it was contended that even if such an order could be passed under s. 33 read with s. 2D of the Act, it could not be done in the present case, as the Company's liabilities in respect of its insurance business did not remain unsatisfied or not otherwise provided for. Messrs. Fraser and Ross as well as the Controller were made parties to the petition. The petition was opposed on behalf of the Controller, and his contention was that the case was clearly covered by s. 2D of the Act and therefore the order under s. 33 was validly passed in this case and that it had not been shown that the liabilities had been satisfied or had been otherwise provided for.
Mr. Aggarwala appearing for the Company has urged the same two points before us. The Act was passed in 1938 to control persons carrying on the business of insurance. Section 2(9) thereof defines an ' insurer' inter alia as weaning any body corporate (not being a person specified in sub-cl. (c) of this clause) carrying on the business of insurance, which is a body corporate incorporated under any law for the time being in force in India or stands to any such body corporate in the relation of a subsidiary company within the meaning of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, as defined by sub-s. (2) of s. 2 of that Act. Section 3 provides for registration of any person carrying on the business of insurance and no such business can be carried on unless a certificate of registration for the particular class of insurance business has been obtained from the Controller. Section 3(4) gives power to the Controller to cancel the certificate for reasons specified therein and s. 3(5B) lays down that when a registration is cancelled the insurer shall not after the cancellation has taken effect, enter into new contracts of insurance, but all rights and liabilities in respect of contracts of insurance entered into by him before such cancellation takes effect shall, subject to the provisions of sub-s. (5D), continue as if the cancellation had not taken place. In order to safeguard the interest of policy- holders, s. 7 provides for deposits by the insurer for various classes of his business. Section 8 lays down that any deposit made under s. 7 shall be deemed to be part of the assets of the insurer but shall not be susceptible of any assignment or charge; nor shall it be available for the discharge of any liability other than liabilities arising out of policies of insurance issued by the insurer so long as any such liability remains undischarged ; nor shall it be liable to attachment in execution of any decree except a decree obtained by a policy-holder of the insurer in respect of a debt due upon a policy which debt the policy-holder has failed to realise in any other way. Section 9(1) lays down that where an insurer has ceased to carry on in India any class of insurance business in respect of which a deposit has been made under s. 7 and his liabilities in India in respect of business of that class have been satisfied or are other. wise provided for, the court may on the application of the insurer order the return to the insurer of so much of the deposit as does not relate to the classes of insurance., if any, which he continues to carry on. Under s. 10 an insurer who carries on business of more than one kind is required to keep a separate account of all receipts and payments in respect of each such class of insurance business. Section 33(1) with which we are directly concerned, is in these terms:-
Section 2D is in these terms:
The contention of Mr. Aggarwala is that s. 33 and s. 2D both refer to an insurer which is defined in s. 2(9) as a person carrying on the business of insurance. He, therefore, contends that as soon as the insurer who was carrying on the business of insurance closes it down completely be no longer remains an insurer and the provisions of the Act do not apply to him. Therefore, according to him, when s. 33 provides for an order of investigation by the Central Government such an order can only be made in respect of a, person who is actually carrying on the business of insurance and is thus an insurer and cannot be made against a person who was an insurer but has closed his business. Further, according to Mr. Aggarwala, s. 2D also speaks of an insurer and makes him subject to all the provisions of the Act with respect to any class of insurance business so long as his liabilities in respect of that class remain unsatisfied or not other. wise provided for and therefore s. 2D would only apply to those cases where insurance business is being carried on, though some class of insurance business might have been closed. The contention therefore is that reading ss. 33 and 2D together, no order under s. 33 can be made in case of an insurer who has completely closed his business of insurance.
The main basis of this contention is the definition of the word "insurer" in s. 2(9) of the Act. It is pointed out that definition begins with the words " insurer means" and is therefore exhaustive. It may be accepted that generally the word " insurer" has been defined for the purposes of the Act to mean a person or body corporate, etc., which is actually carrying on the business of insurance, i.e., the business of effecting contracts of insurance of whatever kind they might be. But s. 2 begins with the words " in this Act, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context " and then come the various definition clauses of which (9) is one. It is well settled that all statutory definitions or abbreviations must be read subject to the qualification variously expressed in the definition clauses which created them and it may be that even where the definition is exhaustive inasmuch as the word defined is said to mean a certain thing, it is possible for the word to have a somewhat different meaning in different sections of the Act depending upon the subject or the context. That is why all definitions in statutes generally begin with the qualifying words similar to the words used in the present case, namely, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context. Therefore in finding out the meaning of the word " insurer " in various sections of the Act, the meaning to be ordinarily given to it is that given in the definition clause. But this is not inflexible and there may be sections in the Act where the meaning may have to be departed from on account of the subject or context in which the word has been used and that will be giving effect to the opening sentence in the definition section, namely, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context. In view of this qualification, the court has not only to look at the words but also to look at the context, the collocation and the object of such words relating to such matter and interpret the meaning intended to be conveyed by the use of the words under the circumstances. Therefore, though ordinarily the word " insurer " as used in the Act would mean a person or body corporate actually carrying on the business of insurance it may be that in certain sections the word may have a somewhat different meaning.
A perusal of a few sections of the Act will illustrate this and immediately show that the word " insurer " has been used in some sections to mean not merely a person actually carrying on the business of insurance but also a person who intends to carry on the business of insurance but has not actually started it and also a person who was carrying on the business of insurance but has ceased to do so. For example, s. 3(2) which deals with an application for registration which naturally has to be made before the business of insurance actually commences, lays down in cl.
(b) that the application shall be accompanied by the name, address and the occupation, if any, of the directors where the insurer is a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act. Here the word ,insurer" has been used to indicate the company which is not actually carrying on the business of insurance but is intending to do so and is applying for registration. Further in s. 3(2) (e) which also deals with an application for registration, it is provided that an insurer having his principal place of business or domicile, outside India shall send along with the application a statement verified by an affidavit of the principal officer of the insurer setting forth various requirements. Here again, the word " insurer " has been used for an intending insurer, for the business of insurance would only begin after the registration certificate is granted on the application made under s. 3(2). Then in s. 9 it is provided that, where an insurer has ceased to carry on business, the court may on the application of the insurer order the return to him of the deposit made under s. 7. This. shows that though the, insurer is not actually carrying on the business of insurance he is still termed an insurer and on his application the deposit may be refunded to him. Again s. 55 which deals with a situation arising out, of the winding-up of an insurance company or the insolvency of any other insurer, provides that the value of the assets and liabilities of the insurer shall be ascertained in such manner and upon such basis as the liquidators or the receiver in insolvency thinks fit. The word "
insurer" as used in s. 33 not only refers to a person who is actually carrying on business but in the context of that section and taking into account the policy of the Act and the, purposes for which the control envisaged by the Act was imposed on insurers also refers to insurers who were carrying on the business of insurance but have closed it. Further if there were any doubt whether the word " insurer "
In the second place it is urged that there can be no question of satisfying or otherwise providing for liabilities unless the liabilities are ascertained and either admitted or proved. In other words the argument is that it is only those liabilities which are admitted by the insurer or which have been decreed against him and the decrees have become final which can be taken into account in deciding whether the liabilities have remained unsatisfied or not otherwise provided for. It is urged that only those liabilities which are ascertained and either undisputed or proved can be satisfied and that the same applies to their being otherwise provided for. It is true that only those liabilities, which are ascertained and either admitted or proved, can be satisfied; but it does not follow that "	Section
The learned Single Judge held that an order under s. 33 read with s. 2D could be passed against the Company and that it had not been shown that the Company's liabilities had been satisfied or otherwise provided for. He therefore dismissed the writ petition. This was followed by an appeal by the Company, which was dismissed. The Division Bench sub- stantially agreed with the view taken by the learned Single Judge. Thereupon the Company applied for a certificate to enable it to appeal to this Court and obtained it; and that is how the matter has come up before us.-	Conclusion

The Division Bench sub- stantially agreed with the view taken by the learned Single Judge. Thereupon the Company applied for a certificate to enable it to appeal to this Court and obtained it; and that is how the matter has come up before us.-
Mr. Aggarwala appearing for the Company has urged the same two points before us. The Act was passed in 1938 to control persons carrying on the business of insurance. Section 2(9) thereof defines an ' insurer' inter alia as weaning any body corporate (not being a person specified in sub-cl. (c) of this clause) carrying on the business of insurance, which is a body corporate incorporated under any law for the time being in force in India or stands to any such body corporate in the relation of a subsidiary company within the meaning of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, as defined by sub-s. (2) of s. 2 of that Act. Section 3 provides for registration of any person carrying on the business of insurance and no such business can be carried on unless a certificate of registration for the particular class of insurance business has been obtained from the Controller. Section 3(4) gives power to the Controller to cancel the certificate for reasons specified therein and s. 3(5B) lays down that when a registration is cancelled the insurer shall not after the cancellation has taken effect, enter into new contracts of insurance, but all rights and liabilities in respect of contracts of insurance entered into by him before such cancellation takes effect shall, subject to the provisions of sub-s. (5D), continue as if the cancellation had not taken place. In order to safeguard the interest of policy- holders, s. 7 provides for deposits by the insurer for various classes of his business. Section 8 lays down that any deposit made under s. 7 shall be deemed to be part of the assets of the insurer but shall not be susceptible of any assignment or charge; nor shall it be available for the discharge of any liability other than liabilities arising out of policies of insurance issued by the insurer so long as any such liability remains undischarged ; nor shall it be liable to attachment in execution of any decree except a decree obtained by a policy-holder of the insurer in respect of a debt due upon a policy which debt the policy-holder has failed to realise in any other way. Section 9(1) lays down that where an insurer has ceased to carry on in India any class of insurance business in respect of which a deposit has been made under s. 7 and his liabilities in India in respect of business of that class have been satisfied or are other. wise provided for, the court may on the application of the insurer order the return to the insurer of so much of the deposit as does not relate to the classes of insurance., if any, which he continues to carry on. Under s. 10 an insurer who carries on business of more than one kind is required to keep a separate account of all receipts and payments in respect of each such class of insurance business. Section 33(1) with which we are directly concerned, is in these terms:-
Section 2D is in these terms:
The contention of Mr. Aggarwala is that s. 33 and s. 2D both refer to an insurer which is defined in s. 2(9) as a person carrying on the business of insurance. He, therefore, contends that as soon as the insurer who was carrying on the business of insurance closes it down completely be no longer remains an insurer and the provisions of the Act do not apply to him. Therefore, according to him, when s. 33 provides for an order of investigation by the Central Government such an order can only be made in respect of a, person who is actually carrying on the business of insurance and is thus an insurer and cannot be made against a person who was an insurer but has closed his business. Further, according to Mr. Aggarwala, s. 2D also speaks of an insurer and makes him subject to all the provisions of the Act with respect to any class of insurance business so long as his liabilities in respect of that class remain unsatisfied or not other. wise provided for and therefore s. 2D would only apply to those cases where insurance business is being carried on, though some class of insurance business might have been closed. The contention therefore is that reading ss. 33 and 2D together, no order under s. 33 can be made in case of an insurer who has completely closed his business of insurance.
The main basis of this contention is the definition of the word "insurer" in s. 2(9) of the Act. It is pointed out that definition begins with the words " insurer means" and is therefore exhaustive. It may be accepted that generally the word " insurer" has been defined for the purposes of the Act to mean a person or body corporate, etc., which is actually carrying on the business of insurance, i.e., the business of effecting contracts of insurance of whatever kind they might be. But s. 2 begins with the words " in this Act, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context " and then come the various definition clauses of which (9) is one. It is well settled that all statutory definitions or abbreviations must be read subject to the qualification variously expressed in the definition clauses which created them and it may be that even where the definition is exhaustive inasmuch as the word defined is said to mean a certain thing, it is possible for the word to have a somewhat different meaning in different sections of the Act depending upon the subject or the context. That is why all definitions in statutes generally begin with the qualifying words similar to the words used in the present case, namely, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context. Therefore in finding out the meaning of the word " insurer " in various sections of the Act, the meaning to be ordinarily given to it is that given in the definition clause. But this is not inflexible and there may be sections in the Act where the meaning may have to be departed from on account of the subject or context in which the word has been used and that will be giving effect to the opening sentence in the definition section, namely, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context. In view of this qualification, the court has not only to look at the words but also to look at the context, the collocation and the object of such words relating to such matter and interpret the meaning intended to be conveyed by the use of the words under the circumstances. Therefore, though ordinarily the word " insurer " as used in the Act would mean a person or body corporate actually carrying on the business of insurance it may be that in certain sections the word may have a somewhat different meaning.
A perusal of a few sections of the Act will illustrate this and immediately show that the word " insurer " has been used in some sections to mean not merely a person actually carrying on the business of insurance but also a person who intends to carry on the business of insurance but has not actually started it and also a person who was carrying on the business of insurance but has ceased to do so. For example, s. 3(2) which deals with an application for registration which naturally has to be made before the business of insurance actually commences, lays down in cl.
(b) that the application shall be accompanied by the name, address and the occupation, if any, of the directors where the insurer is a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act. Here the word ,insurer" has been used to indicate the company which is not actually carrying on the business of insurance but is intending to do so and is applying for registration. Further in s. 3(2) (e) which also deals with an application for registration, it is provided that an insurer having his principal place of business or domicile, outside India shall send along with the application a statement verified by an affidavit of the principal officer of the insurer setting forth various requirements. Here again, the word " insurer " has been used for an intending insurer, for the business of insurance would only begin after the registration certificate is granted on the application made under s. 3(2). Then in s. 9 it is provided that, where an insurer has ceased to carry on business, the court may on the application of the insurer order the return to him of the deposit made under s. 7. This. shows that though the, insurer is not actually carrying on the business of insurance he is still termed an insurer and on his application the deposit may be refunded to him. Again s. 55 which deals with a situation arising out, of the winding-up of an insurance company or the insolvency of any other insurer, provides that the value of the assets and liabilities of the insurer shall be ascertained in such manner and upon such basis as the liquidators or the receiver in insolvency thinks fit. The word "
insurer" as used in s. 33 not only refers to a person who is actually carrying on business but in the context of that section and taking into account the policy of the Act and the, purposes for which the control envisaged by the Act was imposed on insurers also refers to insurers who were carrying on the business of insurance but have closed it. Further if there were any doubt whether the word " insurer "
prima facie " advisedly, for it seems to have been suggested in the High Court that no order could be passed under s. 33 unless it was proved to the hilt that there were liabilities which remained unsatisfied or otherwise unprovided for. It is obvious that such proof would only be available after investigation in to the affairs of the insurer. Therefore in order that s. 2D may be workable, all that is required under it is that the Central Government should be satisfied after such prima facie inquiry as it considers necessary that there are reasons to believe that the liabilities of the insurer who has closed his business remain unsatisfied or not otherwise provided for and in coming to this prima facie conclusion the Central Government may make enquiry from the insurer with respect to complaints that it may have received against him. But the fact that the order does not on the face of it show that the Central Government considered this aspect of the matter would not make it bad, if in subsequent proceedings taken to challenge it is shown that there were materials before the Central Government which would justify its coming to the prima facie conclusion that the liabilities had Dot been satisfied or otherwise provided for, and therefore an investigation into the affairs was called for. In the present case we find from the materials on the record that there were complaints before the Central Government from those who had claims against the company. Those complaints were apparently referred to the Company and it does not appear that the Company satisfied the Central Government that the complaints were unjustified. It was in this situation that the order for investigation was made in July, 1957, after the Company had closed its insurance business. Further on the materials available on the record it does appear that even now there are claims pending to the tune of about one lac of rupees against the Company. So it cannot be said that there were no liabilities of the Company outstanding which were not satisfied or otherwise provided for when the order was made in July, 1957. In the circumstances the order cannot be held to be bad because it does not show on the face of it that there were liabilities which had remained unsatisfied or not otherwise provided for.
In the second place it is urged that there can be no question of satisfying or otherwise providing for liabilities unless the liabilities are ascertained and either admitted or proved. In other words the argument is that it is only those liabilities which are admitted by the insurer or which have been decreed against him and the decrees have become final which can be taken into account in deciding whether the liabilities have remained unsatisfied or not otherwise provided for. It is urged that only those liabilities which are ascertained and either undisputed or proved can be satisfied and that the same applies to their being otherwise provided for. It is true that only those liabilities, which are ascertained and either admitted or proved, can be satisfied; but it does not follow that "
provision otherwise " he will have to satisfy the court that the " provision otherwise " has been fully made and the court will be in a position to investigate into the matter. This, however, does not mean that if the insurer does not want to take advantage of s. 9 of the Act he can say without submitting to the terms of that section that he has made " provision otherwise ", because the deposit which is made under s. 7 is more than all his liabilities of the insurance business that he has closed. It is urged that it is hard, for example, on an insurer who has a large deposit and whose liabilities are small that he should not be able to fall back on his deposit for the purposes of s. 2D. We do not, however, see any hardship in a case of this kind, for if it is a fact that the deposit of the insurer is large and his liabilities are small he can always take advantage of s. 9 of the Act and submit to an investigation by the court and take back his deposit after depositing the small sum required to meet his liabilities. We are, therefore, of opinion that when s. 2D speaks of satisfaction or "	Total Judgement
