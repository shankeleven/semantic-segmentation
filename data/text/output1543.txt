1960. November 1. The Judgment of the Court' was delivered by HIDAYATULLAH J.-The Commissioner of Incometax, Bombay Circle II, has filed this appeal after obtaining special leave, against the judgment of the High Court of Bombay in an Income-tax reference under s. 66(2) of the Income-tax Act. The National Syndicate, Bombay (referred to in this judgment as the respondent) was a firm consisting of three partners. This firm acquired on January 11, 1945, a tailoring business as a going concern from one Chambal Singh for Rs. 89,321/-. Included in this amount was the consideration paid for sewing machines (Rs. 72,000) and a motor lorry (Rs. 8,000). The assessment concerns the year of account of the respondent, January 11, 1945 to February 28, 1946. The business of the respondent was to prepare garments for Government departments, and during the war years, this appears to have been a profitable business. Immediately after the respondent acquired this business, the last war came to an end, and the respondent found it difficult to continue the business. It, therefore, closed its business in August, 1945. Between August 16, 1945 and February 14, 1946, sewing machines were sold at a loss of Rs. 41,998. The motor lorry was also sold on February 14,1946, at a loss of Rs. 3,700. The respondent closed its account books on February 28, 1946, showing the two losses and writing them off.
For the assessment year, 1946.47, the respondent claimed a deduction of Rs. 45,698 under s. 10(2)(vii) of the Indian Income-tax Act. The Income-tax Officer disallowed this deduction, holding that the loss was of a capital nature, and that inasmuch as the business of the respondent was not carried on after August 1945 s. 10(2)(vii) was not applicable. This order of assessment was confirmed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, who also held that the loss represented capital loss, as the machines and the motor lorry were sold after the closure of the business. On appeal, the Appellate Tribunal, Bombay, also confirmed the order, holding that the sales of machines and the motor lorry were made in the course of the winding up of the assessee's business after the business had been stopped, and that, therefore, the deduction could not be claimed under s. 10(2Xvii).
The respondent asked the Tribunal to refer the questions of law arising from its order, but the request was refused. It then moved the High Court, and obtained an order under s. 66(2) of the Income-tax Act, and the following two questions were referred:
The High Court answered the first question in the affirmative, holding that there was evidence on which the Tribunal could reach the conclusion that the business had, in fact, been continued only till August 28, 1945. On the second question, the High Court was of the opinion that the business having been carried on for at least a part of the account year, s. 10(2)(vii) was applicable, and that, therefore, this allowance had to be made under that clause. The High Court, therefore, answered the question in the negative. The High Court refused to grant a certificate to appeal to this Court, but the Commissioner of Income-tax applied for, and obtained special leave, and this appeal has been filed.
In The Liquidators of Pursa Limited v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Bihar (1), the year of, assessment was 1945-46, which corresponded to the accounting year, October 1, 1943 to September 30, 1944. Pursa Limited were manufacturers of sugar, and sold the business on August 9, 1943, including buildings, machinery and plant but excluding manufactured sugar worth about Rs. 6,00,000. This sugar was sold till June, 1944; but throughout the accounting period, the machinery, plant or buildings were not used. Pursa Limited went into voluntary liquidation on June 20, 1945. In the sale of the buildings, machinery and plant there was an excess, such as is described in the second proviso, and that amount of excess was sought to be taxed. This was negatived by this Court on two grounds. They were (a): " If the machinery and plant have not at all been used at any time during the accounting year no allowance can be claimed under clause (vii) in respect of them and the second proviso also does not come into operation "; and (b) " that the intention of the company was to discontinue its business and the sale of the machinery and plant was a step in the process of winding up of its business. The sale of the machinery and plant was not an operation in furtherance of the business carried on by the Company but was a realisation of its assets in the process of gradual winding up of its business which eventually culminated in the voluntary liquidation of the Company".	Facts
Before we deal with the question whether s. 10(2) (vii) of the Indian Income-tax Act is applicable to the facts of this case, we may mention that during the course of the argument Mr. S. P. Mehta, counsel for the respondent, sought to re- open the first question. According to him, there was no evidence on which the Tribunal or the High Court could reach the conclusion that the business of the respondent had come to a close in August 1945. We, however, did not permit him to raise this contention, partly because, in our opinion, such a contention could not be allowed to be raised at this stage in an appeal by the Department and partly because, in our opinion, there were adequate materials for the High Court to have based its conclusion. Inasmuch as we were in agreement with the High Court on the question of the applicability of s. 10(2)(vii), we also felt that no useful purpose would be served in examining the matter to find out whether the business had, in fact, closed on August 28, 1945 or had continued till the end of the account year. We are really concerned in this appeal with the interpretation of s. 10(2)(vii) and its applicability to the facts of the case. It may be assumed for the purposes of this case that the business did, in fact, close down on August 28,1945, even though some in comings and outgoings were taking place for the rest of the year and the books of account were not finally closed till February 28, 1946. The Commissioner contends that an allowance could only be claimed if the sale of machines etc., took place when the business was being continued and not if the business had come to a close. The respondent, on the other hand, submits that s. 10(2)(vii) would be applicable in a case where the business continued for a part of the account year, even though the sale of the machinery, plant etc., took place after the closure of the business during the course of the account year.
Learned Counsel for the respondent relies upon the passage last quoted, and urges that where the buildings, machinery or plant have been used for a part of the accounting period, the ruling cannot apply, and draws attention to the words "	RespArg
In both the cases, the business had admittedly closed down before the sales took place, and it was held, applying the proviso as it was before the amendment of 1949, that such receipts were not taxable. The amendment now renders these cases obsolete. Reliance is, however, placed on certain observations in these oases, and it is contended that the same reasoning must be applied to a case of loss as to a case of profits. We shall, therefore, refer briefly to them.
We must thus restrict ourselves to the scheme of the Indian Income-tax Act and the clause in question. The scheme of the Income-tax Act, as was pointed out by Lord Porter in Indian Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Bengal (1), is that income. tax is assessed and paid in the next succeeding year upon the results of the year before. It is the income of the previous year which is brought to tax in the succeeding year, which is called the year of assessment. For the purpose of assessment, the Indian Income Tax Act divides the sources of income, profits (1) [1943] 11 I.T.R. 328, 336.
In Commissioner of Income-tax v. Shaw Wallace & Co., Ltd. (1), it was pointed out by the Judicial Committee that the words " carried on by him " were " an essential constituent of that which is to produce the taxable income; it is to be the profit earned by a process of production ". It was further pointed out that " business " had been defined in the Income-tax Act to " include any trade, commerce or manufacture, or any adventure or concern in the nature of trade, commerce or manufacture ", and that it involved " a fundamental idea of the continuous exercise of an activity." It was, however, pointed out that the source was not necessarily one which was expected to be continuously productive, but one whose object was the production of a definite return, excluding anything in the nature of a mere windfall, and that 'capital' in most cases was hardly more than an element in the process of production. We agree with this analysis of the Income-tax Act, and indeed, these observations were also applied in the Pursa Limited case (2), to which we have already referred. It thus follows that capital may, in the process of production, depreciate, get used up or lost. The Income-tax Act, while taxing income, profits or gains, takes note of, and makes allowance for such eventualities.	Precedent
Section 10(2)(vii) reads as follows:
The words underlined above were inserted by s. 11 of the Taxation Laws (Extension to Merged States and Amendment) Act, 1949.
These two cases deal with the second proviso to s. 10(2Xvii). Clause (vii) deals with loss and the second proviso, with profits; but the proviso is not an exact counterpart of the clause. The proviso enacts a fiction which the main clause does not enact. The reason for the introduction of the fiction in the proviso appears to be this: Loss in business may take place in various ways. If the business requires more to run it than it produces, there is loss. Loss in (1) [1954] S.C.R. 767.
business may also take place if the equipment with which business is done is lost, destroyed, or depreciates or suffers in value. The law takes note of the loss, and, provided it has been computed and brought into the books of the business and written off, it can be claimed as a deduction. Profit in business, on the other hand, primarily, means profit earned in the business. But if an allowance had been claimed as depreciation and had been allowed, and if the sale of the building, machinery or plant on which depreciation allowance was claimed in the past, shows that there was, in fact, no depreciation but an accretion in value, the law deems that a profit has been made. The fiction thus converts that which may not be strictly profit of the business in a narrow sense, into a profit for purposes of assessment. Formerly, it was a matter of doubt whether even this accretion could be deemed a profit when the business had closed down; but now, the legislature has amended the law by saying that this fictional profit must be brought to tax irrespective of the fact that the sale took place " during the continuance of the business or after the cessation thereof" But it is to be noticed that no such amendment was made in cl. (vii) to exclude loss over buildings, machinery or plant after the clospre of the business. It is thus clear that the principles which govern the proviso cannot be used to govern the main clause, because profit or loss arise in different ways in business. The two rulings do not, therefore, apply to the facts here.
Sections 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 12A and 12B lay down' the rules of computation under the different heads. Profits and gains of business are dealt with in s. 10. The first subjection of that section provides:	Section

In view of what we have said above, we are of opinion that the judgment of the High Court was correct in all the circumstances of this case, and this appeal must be dismissed with costs.
Appeal dismissed.	Conclusion

1960. November 1. The Judgment of the Court' was delivered by HIDAYATULLAH J.-The Commissioner of Incometax, Bombay Circle II, has filed this appeal after obtaining special leave, against the judgment of the High Court of Bombay in an Income-tax reference under s. 66(2) of the Income-tax Act. The National Syndicate, Bombay (referred to in this judgment as the respondent) was a firm consisting of three partners. This firm acquired on January 11, 1945, a tailoring business as a going concern from one Chambal Singh for Rs. 89,321/-. Included in this amount was the consideration paid for sewing machines (Rs. 72,000) and a motor lorry (Rs. 8,000). The assessment concerns the year of account of the respondent, January 11, 1945 to February 28, 1946. The business of the respondent was to prepare garments for Government departments, and during the war years, this appears to have been a profitable business. Immediately after the respondent acquired this business, the last war came to an end, and the respondent found it difficult to continue the business. It, therefore, closed its business in August, 1945. Between August 16, 1945 and February 14, 1946, sewing machines were sold at a loss of Rs. 41,998. The motor lorry was also sold on February 14,1946, at a loss of Rs. 3,700. The respondent closed its account books on February 28, 1946, showing the two losses and writing them off.
For the assessment year, 1946.47, the respondent claimed a deduction of Rs. 45,698 under s. 10(2)(vii) of the Indian Income-tax Act. The Income-tax Officer disallowed this deduction, holding that the loss was of a capital nature, and that inasmuch as the business of the respondent was not carried on after August 1945 s. 10(2)(vii) was not applicable. This order of assessment was confirmed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, who also held that the loss represented capital loss, as the machines and the motor lorry were sold after the closure of the business. On appeal, the Appellate Tribunal, Bombay, also confirmed the order, holding that the sales of machines and the motor lorry were made in the course of the winding up of the assessee's business after the business had been stopped, and that, therefore, the deduction could not be claimed under s. 10(2Xvii).
The respondent asked the Tribunal to refer the questions of law arising from its order, but the request was refused. It then moved the High Court, and obtained an order under s. 66(2) of the Income-tax Act, and the following two questions were referred:
The High Court answered the first question in the affirmative, holding that there was evidence on which the Tribunal could reach the conclusion that the business had, in fact, been continued only till August 28, 1945. On the second question, the High Court was of the opinion that the business having been carried on for at least a part of the account year, s. 10(2)(vii) was applicable, and that, therefore, this allowance had to be made under that clause. The High Court, therefore, answered the question in the negative. The High Court refused to grant a certificate to appeal to this Court, but the Commissioner of Income-tax applied for, and obtained special leave, and this appeal has been filed.
Before we deal with the question whether s. 10(2) (vii) of the Indian Income-tax Act is applicable to the facts of this case, we may mention that during the course of the argument Mr. S. P. Mehta, counsel for the respondent, sought to re- open the first question. According to him, there was no evidence on which the Tribunal or the High Court could reach the conclusion that the business of the respondent had come to a close in August 1945. We, however, did not permit him to raise this contention, partly because, in our opinion, such a contention could not be allowed to be raised at this stage in an appeal by the Department and partly because, in our opinion, there were adequate materials for the High Court to have based its conclusion. Inasmuch as we were in agreement with the High Court on the question of the applicability of s. 10(2)(vii), we also felt that no useful purpose would be served in examining the matter to find out whether the business had, in fact, closed on August 28, 1945 or had continued till the end of the account year.

Section 10(2)(vii) reads as follows:

The amendment now renders these cases obsolete. Reliance is, however, placed on certain observations in these oases, and it is contended that the same reasoning must be applied to a case of loss as to a case of profits. We shall, therefore, refer briefly to them.
In The Liquidators of Pursa Limited v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Bihar (1), the year of, assessment was 1945-46, which corresponded to the accounting year, October 1, 1943 to September 30, 1944. Pursa Limited were manufacturers of sugar, and sold the business on August 9, 1943, including buildings, machinery and plant but excluding manufactured sugar worth about Rs. 6,00,000. This sugar was sold till June, 1944; but throughout the accounting period, the machinery, plant or buildings were not used. Pursa Limited went into voluntary liquidation on June 20, 1945. In the sale of the buildings, machinery and plant there was an excess, such as is described in the second proviso, and that amount of excess was sought to be taxed. This was negatived by this Court on two grounds. They were (a): " If the machinery and plant have not at all been used at any time during the accounting year no allowance can be claimed under clause (vii) in respect of them and the second proviso also does not come into operation "; and (b) " that the intention of the company was to discontinue its business and the sale of the machinery and plant was a step in the process of winding up of its business. The sale of the machinery and plant was not an operation in furtherance of the business carried on by the Company but was a realisation of its assets in the process of gradual winding up of its business which eventually culminated in the voluntary liquidation of the Company".
Counsel differ as to the ratio of the case. The Commissioner contends that the ratio is that no sale, whether at a loss, or at a profit can be said to fall within, respectively, cl. (vii) or the second proviso, if it takes place after the closure of business and during the process of winding up, while the respondent contends that the real ratio was that during the account year the machinery and plant were not at all used. No doubt, this Court did give two reasons for its decision, but the primary consideration was the second ratio quoted above. This is clear from the following passage towards the end of the judgment:
Learned Counsel for the respondent relies upon the passage last quoted, and urges that where the buildings, machinery or plant have been used for a part of the accounting period, the ruling cannot apply, and draws attention to the words "
