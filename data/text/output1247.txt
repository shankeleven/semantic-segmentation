Ganapathy Iyer and D. Gupta, for the appellant. Gurbachan Singh and Harbans Singh, for the respondent. 1959. October 28. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SUBBA RAO J.-This appeal on a certificate granted by the High Court of Judicature for Punjab at Chandigarh is directed against its judgment confirming that of the Subordinate Judge, First class, Delhi, in a suit filed by the respondent against the appellant for the recovery of compensation in respect of non-delivery of goods entrusted by the former to the latter for transit to New Delhi. On August 15, 1947, India was constituted into two Dominions, India and Pakistan; and soon thereafter civil disturbances broke out in both the Dominions, The respondent and others, who were in government employment at Quetta, found themselves caught in the disturbances and took refuge with their household effects in a government camp. The respondent collected the goods of himself and of sixteen other officers, and on September 4, 1947, booked them at Quetta Railway Station to New Delhi by a passenger train as per parcel way bill No. 317909. Under the said bill the respondent was both the consignor and consignee. The N. W. Railway (hereinafter called the Receiving Railway) ends at the Pakistan frontier and the E. P. Railway (hereinafter called the Forwarding Railway) begins from the point where the other line ends; and the first railway station at the frontier inside the Indian territory is Khem Karan. The wagon containing the goods of the respondent and others, which was 'duly seated and labelled indicating its destination as New Delhi, reached Khem Karan from Kasur, Pakistan, before November 1, 1947, and the said wagon was intact and the entries in the " inward summary." tallied with the entries on the labels. Thereafter it traveled on its onward march to Amritsar and reached that place on November 1, 1947. There also the wagon was found to be intact and the label showed that it was bound to New Delhi from Quetta. On November 2, 1947, it reached Ludhiana and remained there between November 2, 1947 and January 14, 1948; and the " vehicle summary " showed that the wagon bad a label showing that it was going from Lahore to some unknown destination. It is said that the said wagon arrived in the unloading shed at New Delhi on February 13, 1948, and it was unloaded on February 20, 1948; but no immediate information of the said fact was given to the respondent. Indeed, when the respondent made an anxious enquiry by his letter dated February 23, 1948, the Chief Administrative Officer informed him that necessary action would be taken and he would be addressed again on the subject. After further correspondence, on June 7, 1949, the Chief Administrative Officer wrote to the respondent to make arrangements to take delivery of packages lying at New Delhi Station, but when the respondent went there to take delivery of the goods, he was told that the goods were not traceable. On July 24, 1948, the respondent was asked to contact one Mr. Krishan Lal, Assistant Claims Inspector, and take delivery of the goods. Only a few articles, fifteen in number and weighing about 61 maunds, were offered to him subject to the condition of payment of Rs. 1,067-8 0 on account of freight, and the respondent refused to take delivery of them. After further correspondence, the respondent made a claim against the Forwarding Railway in a sum of Rs. 1,62,123 with interest as compensation for the non-delivery of the goods entrusted to the said Railway, and, as the demand was not complied with, he filed a suit against the Dominion of India in the Court of the Senior Subordinate Judge, Delhi, for recovery of the said amount. The defendant raised various pleas, both technical and substantive to non-suit the plaintiff. The learned Subordinate Judge raised as many as 15 issues on the pleadings and held that the suit was within time, that the notice issued complied with the provisions of the relevant statutes, that the respondent had locus stand to file the suit and that the respondent had made out his claim only to the extent of Rs. 80,000; in the result, the suit was decreed for a sum of Rs. 80,000 with proportionate costs.	Facts
In this Court the appellant questions the correctness of the said decree. Learned Counsel for the appellant raised before us the following points: (1) there was no privity of contract between the respondent and the Forwarding Railway, and if he had any claim it was only against the Receiving Railway; (2) the suit was barred by limitation both under Art. 30 and Art 31 of the Indian Limitation Act and it was not saved by any acknowledgement or acknowledgements of the claim made within s. 19 of the Limitation Act; and (3) the notice given by the respondent under s. 77 of the Indian Railways Act, 1890, did not comply with the provisions of the said section inasmuch as the claim for compensation made thereunder was not preferred within six months from the date of the delivery of the goods for carriage by the Railway. The third point may be taken up first and disposed of shortly. Before the learned Subordinate Judge it was conceded by the learned Counsel for the defendant that the notice, Ex. P-32, fully satisfied the requirements of s. 77 of the Indian Railways Act, and on that concession it was held that a valid notice under s. 77 of the said Act bad been given by the respondent. In the High Court no attempt was made to question the factum of this concession; nor was it questioned by the appellant in its application for special leave. As the question was a mixed one of fact and law, we would not be justified to allow the appellant at this very late stage to reopen the closed matter. We, therefore, reject this contention.
The learned Counsel for the appellant argued that art. 30 would apply to the suit claim, whereas the learned Counsel for the respondent contended that art. 31 would be more appropriate to the suit claim.We shall assume that art. 30 governed the suit claim and proceed to consider the question on that basis.

G.W. Patson in the book "Bailment in the Common Law" says, at p. 42, thus:
At p. 44 the learned author illustrates the principle by giving as an example a carrier of goods entrusting them to another carrier for part of the journey. One of the illustrations given by Byles J. in Bristol. And Exeter Railway v. Collins (1) is rather instructive and it (1) VII H.L.C. 194,212, visualises a situation which may be approximated to. the present one and it is as follows:

-------------------------------------------------------------- Article 30 applies to a suit by a person claiming com- pensation against the railway for its losing or injuring his goods; and art. 31 for compensation for nondelivery or delay in delivering the goods.	Precedent
This argument is not a new one but one raised before and the Courts offered different solutions based on the peculiar facts of each case. The decided cases were based upon one or other of the following principles: (i) the Receiving Railway is the agent of the Forwarding Railway;
(ii) both the Railways constitute a partnership and each acts as the agent of the other; (iii) the Receiving Railway is the agent of the consignor in entrusting the goods to the Forwarding Railway: an instructive and exhaustive discussion on the said three principles in their application to varying situations is found in Kulu Ram Maigraj v. The Madras Railway Company (1), G. I. P. Railway Co. v. Radhakisan Khushaldas (2 ), and Bristol And Exeter Railway v. Collins (3); (iv) the Receiving Railway, which is the bailee of the goods, is authorized by the consignor to appoint the Forwarding Railway as a sub-bailee, and, after such appointment, direct relationship of bailment is constituted between the consignor and the sub-bailee; and (v) in the case of through booked traffic the consignor of the goods is given an option under's. 80 of the Indian Railways. Act to recover compensation either from the Railway Administration to which the goods are delivered or from the Railway Administration in whose jurisdiction the loss, injury. destruction or deterioration occurs. Some of the aforesaid principles cannot obviously be applied to the present case. The statutory liability under s. 80 of the Indian Railways Act cannot be invoked, as that section applies only to a case of through booked traffic involving two or more Railway Administration in India; whereas in the present case the Receiving Railway is situated in Pakistan and the Forwarding Railway in the Indian territory. India and Pakistan are two independent sovereign powers, and by the doctrine of lex loci contractus, s. 80, cannot (1) I.L.R. 3 Mad. 240. (2) I.L.R. 5 Bom. 371 (3) VII H L.C. 194.
We shall first consider the scope of the fourth principle and its applicability to the facts of this case. Section 72 of the Indian Railways Act says that the responsibility of a railway administration for the loss, destruction or deterioration of animals or goods delivered to the administration to be carried by railway shall, subject to the other provisions of the Act, be that of a bailee under ss. 151, 152 and 161 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Section 148 of the Indian Contract Act defines " bailment "
carrv his goods on the railway to a place in India with whom Pakistan had no treaty arrangement in the matter of through booked traffic. In that situation the authority in the agent must necessarily be implied to appoint the Forwarding Railway to act for the consignor during that part of the journey of the goods by the Indian Railway; and, if so, by force of -the said section, the Forwarding Railway would be an agent of the consignor. If no such agency can be implied, in our view, a tacit agreement between the Receiving Railway and the Forwarding Railway to carry the respondent's goods to their destination may be implied from the facts found and the conduct of all the parties concerned. If the Receiving Railway was not an agent of the Forwarding Railway, and if there was no arrangement between the two Governments, the position in law would be that the foreign railway administration, having regard to the exigencies of the situation obtaining during those critical days, brought the wagon containing the goods of the respondent and left it with the Forwarding Railway; and the latter consciously took over the responsibility of the bailee, carried the wagon to New Delhi and offered to deliver the goods to the respondent. The respondent also accepted that relationship and sought to make the Forwarding Railway responsible for the loss as his bailee. On these facts and also on the basis of the course of conduct of the parties, we have no difficulty in implying a contract of bailment between the respondent and the Forwarding Railway. We may also state that s. 71 of the Indian Contract Act permits the recognition of a contract of bailment implied by law under circumstances which are of lesser significance than those present in this case. The said section reads:	Section
goods.
The question now is, when does the period of limitation under art. 30 start to run against the claimant ? The third column against art. 30 mentions that the said claim should be made within one year from the date when the loss or injury occurs. The burden is upon the defendant who seeks to non-suit the plaintiff on the ground of limitation to establish that the loss occurred beyond one year from the date of the suit. The proposition is self-evident and no citation is called for.
Has the defendant, therefore, on whom the burden rests to prove that the loss occurred beyond the prescribed period, established that fact in this case ? The suit was filed on August 4, 1949. In the plaint the plaintiff has stated that loss to the goods has taken place on the defendant-railway, and, therefore, delivery has not been effected. Though in the written statement there was a vague 'denial of this fact the evidence already noticed by us established beyond any reasonable doubt that the goods were lost by the Forwarding Railway when they were in its custody. But there is no clear evidence adduced by the defendant to prove when the goods were lost. It is argued that the goods must have been lost by the said Railway at the latest on February 20, 1948, when the goods are alleged to have been unloaded from the wagon at the New Delhi Station; but we have already discussed the relevant evidence on that question and we have held that the defendant did not place before the Court any contemporaneous record to prove when the goods were taken out of the wagon. Indeed, the learned Subordinate Judge in a considered judgment held that it had not been established by the Forwarding Railway that the goods were lost beyond the period of limitation. The correctness of this finding was not canvassed in the High Court, and for the reasons already mentioned, on this material produced, there was every justification for the findings. If so, it follows that the suit was well within time. In this view it is not necessary to express our opinion on the question whether there was a subsequent acknowledgment of the appellant's liability within the meaning of art- 19 of the Indian Limitation Act. In the result, the appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.
Appeal dismissed.	Conclusion

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SUBBA RAO J.-This appeal on a certificate granted by the High Court of Judicature for Punjab at Chandigarh is directed against its judgment confirming that of the Subordinate Judge, First class, Delhi, in a suit filed by the respondent against the appellant for the recovery of compensation in respect of non-delivery of goods entrusted by the former to the latter for transit to New Delhi.

It is said that the said wagon arrived in the unloading shed at New Delhi on February 13, 1948, and it was unloaded on February 20, 1948; but no immediate information of the said fact was given to the respondent. Indeed, when the respondent made an anxious enquiry by his letter dated February 23, 1948, the Chief Administrative Officer informed him that necessary action would be taken and he would be addressed again on the subject. After further correspondence, on June 7, 1949, the Chief Administrative Officer wrote to the respondent to make arrangements to take delivery of packages lying at New Delhi Station, but when the respondent went there to take delivery of the goods, he was told that the goods were not traceable.

The appellant carried the matter on appeal to -the High Court of Punjab, which practically accepted all the findings arrived at by the learned Subordinate Judge and dismissed the appeal.
In this Court the appellant questions the correctness of the said decree. Learned Counsel for the appellant raised before us the following points: (1) there was no privity of contract between the respondent and the Forwarding Railway, and if he had any claim it was only against the Receiving Railway; (2) the suit was barred by limitation both under Art. 30 and Art 31 of the Indian Limitation Act and it was not saved by any acknowledgement or acknowledgements of the claim made within s. 19 of the Limitation Act; and (3) the notice given by the respondent under s. 77 of the Indian Railways Act, 1890, did not comply with the provisions of the said section inasmuch as the claim for compensation made thereunder was not preferred within six months from the date of the delivery of the goods for carriage by the Railway. The third point may be taken up first and disposed of shortly. Before the learned Subordinate Judge it was conceded by the learned Counsel for the defendant that the notice, Ex. P-32, fully satisfied the requirements of s. 77 of the Indian Railways Act, and on that concession it was held that a valid notice under s. 77 of the said Act bad been given by the respondent. In the High Court no attempt was made to question the factum of this concession; nor was it questioned by the appellant in its application for special leave. As the question was a mixed one of fact and law, we would not be justified to allow the appellant at this very late stage to reopen the closed matter. We, therefore, reject this contention.
The learned Counsel for the appellant elaborates his first point thus : The Receiving Railway, the argument, proceeds, entered into an agreement with the respondent to carry the goods for consideration to their destination i.e., New Delhi, and in carrying out the terms of the contract it might have employed the agency of the Forwarding Railway, but the consignor was not in any way concerned with it and if loss was caused to him by the default or neligence of the Receiving Railway, he could only look to it for compensation and he had no cause of action against the Forwarding Railway.
This argument is not a new one but one raised before and the Courts offered different solutions based on the peculiar facts of each case. The decided cases were based upon one or other of the following principles: (i) the Receiving Railway is the agent of the Forwarding Railway;
(ii) both the Railways constitute a partnership and each acts as the agent of the other; (iii) the Receiving Railway is the agent of the consignor in entrusting the goods to the Forwarding Railway: an instructive and exhaustive discussion on the said three principles in their application to varying situations is found in Kulu Ram Maigraj v. The Madras Railway Company (1), G. I. P. Railway Co. v. Radhakisan Khushaldas (2 ), and Bristol And Exeter Railway v. Collins (3); (iv) the Receiving Railway, which is the bailee of the goods, is authorized by the consignor to appoint the Forwarding Railway as a sub-bailee, and, after such appointment, direct relationship of bailment is constituted between the consignor and the sub-bailee; and (v) in the case of through booked traffic the consignor of the goods is given an option under's. 80 of the Indian Railways. Act to recover compensation either from the Railway Administration to which the goods are delivered or from the Railway Administration in whose jurisdiction the loss, injury. destruction or deterioration occurs. Some of the aforesaid principles cannot obviously be applied to the present case. The statutory liability under s. 80 of the Indian Railways Act cannot be invoked, as that section applies only to a case of through booked traffic involving two or more Railway Administration in India; whereas in the present case the Receiving Railway is situated in Pakistan and the Forwarding Railway in the Indian territory. India and Pakistan are two independent sovereign powers, and by the doctrine of lex loci contractus, s. 80, cannot (1) I.L.R. 3 Mad. 240. (2) I.L.R. 5 Bom. 371 (3) VII H L.C. 194.
apply beyond the territories of India; nor can the respondent rely upon the first two principles. There is no allegation, much less proof, that there was any treaty arrangement between these two states governing the rights inter se in the matter of through booked traffic. This process of elimination leads us to the consideration of the applicability of principles (iii) and (iv) to the facts of the present case. The problem presented can only be solved by invoking the correct principle of law to mould the relief on the basis of the facts found.
We shall first consider the scope of the fourth principle and its applicability to the facts of this case. Section 72 of the Indian Railways Act says that the responsibility of a railway administration for the loss, destruction or deterioration of animals or goods delivered to the administration to be carried by railway shall, subject to the other provisions of the Act, be that of a bailee under ss. 151, 152 and 161 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Section 148 of the Indian Contract Act defines " bailment "
G.W. Patson in the book "Bailment in the Common Law" says, at p. 42, thus:
At p. 44 the learned author illustrates the principle by giving as an example a carrier of goods entrusting them to another carrier for part of the journey. One of the illustrations given by Byles J. in Bristol. And Exeter Railway v. Collins (1) is rather instructive and it (1) VII H.L.C. 194,212, visualises a situation which may be approximated to. the present one and it is as follows:
The principle embodied in this section is clearly stated by Thesiger L. J. in De Buasche v. Alt (1) at p. 310 thus :
The aforesaid facts clearly indicate that the respondent appointed the Receiving Railway as his agent to

carrv his goods on the railway to a place in India with whom Pakistan had no treaty arrangement in the matter of through booked traffic. In that situation the authority in the agent must necessarily be implied to appoint the Forwarding Railway to act for the consignor during that part of the journey of the goods by the Indian Railway; and, if so, by force of -the said section, the Forwarding Railway would be an agent of the consignor. If no such agency can be implied, in our view, a tacit agreement between the Receiving Railway and the Forwarding Railway to carry the respondent's goods to their destination may be implied from the facts found and the conduct of all the parties concerned. If the Receiving Railway was not an agent of the Forwarding Railway, and if there was no arrangement between the two Governments, the position in law would be that the foreign railway administration, having regard to the exigencies of the situation obtaining during those critical days, brought the wagon containing the goods of the respondent and left it with the Forwarding Railway; and the latter consciously took over the responsibility of the bailee, carried the wagon to New Delhi and offered to deliver the goods to the respondent. The respondent also accepted that relationship and sought to make the Forwarding Railway responsible for the loss as his bailee. On these facts and also on the basis of the course of conduct of the parties, we have no difficulty in implying a contract of bailment between the respondent and the Forwarding Railway. We may also state that s. 71 of the Indian Contract Act permits the recognition of a contract of bailment implied by law under circumstances which are of lesser significance than those present in this case. The said section reads:
goods.
-------------------------------------------------------------- Article 30 applies to a suit by a person claiming com- pensation against the railway for its losing or injuring his goods; and art. 31 for compensation for nondelivery or delay in delivering the goods.
The learned Counsel for the appellant argued that art. 30 would apply to the suit claim, whereas the learned Counsel for the respondent contended that art. 31 would be more appropriate to the suit claim.We shall assume that art. 30 governed the suit claim and proceed to consider the question on that basis.
The question now is, when does the period of limitation under art. 30 start to run against the claimant ? The third column against art. 30 mentions that the said claim should be made within one year from the date when the loss or injury occurs. The burden is upon the defendant who seeks to non-suit the plaintiff on the ground of limitation to establish that the loss occurred beyond one year from the date of the suit. The proposition is self-evident and no citation is called for.
Has the defendant, therefore, on whom the burden rests to prove that the loss occurred beyond the prescribed period, established that fact in this case ? The suit was filed on August 4, 1949. In the plaint the plaintiff has stated that loss to the goods has taken place on the defendant-railway, and, therefore, delivery has not been effected. Though in the written statement there was a vague 'denial of this fact the evidence already noticed by us established beyond any reasonable doubt that the goods were lost by the Forwarding Railway when they were in its custody.
