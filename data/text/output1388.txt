The Company has preferred the present appeal on the strength of a certificate issued by the High Court under Art. 133(1)(a) of the Constitution.
section shall have effect as if for the periods of eight years and four years a period of one year was substituted.
Mr. Sastri argued that the question whether the Income-tax Officer had reason to believe that under assessment had occurred " by reason of nondisclosure of material facts "	Issue
DAS GUPTA J.-This appeal is against an appellate decision of a Bench of the Calcutta High Court by which in reversal of the order made by the Trial Judge the Bench rejected the present appellant's application under Art. 226 of the Constitution. The appellant is a private limited company incorporated under the Indian Company's Act and has its registered office in Calcutta. It was assessed to income- tax for the assessment years, 1942-43, 1943-44- and 1944-45 by three separate orders dated January 26, 1944, February 12, 1944, and February 15, 1945, respectively. These assessments were,made under s. 23(3) of the Indian Income- tax Act upon returns filed by it accompanied by statements of account. The first two assessments were made by Mr. L. D. Rozario the then Income-tax Officer and the last one by Mr. K. D. Banerjee. The taxes assessed were duly paid up. On March 28, 1951, three notices purporting to be under s. 34 of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, were issued by the income-tax Officer calling upon the company to submit fresh returns of its total income and the total world income assessable for the three accounting years relating to the three assessment years, 1942-43 1943-44 and 1944-45. The appellant company furnished re. turns in compliance with the notices but on September 18, 1951, applied to the High Court of Calcutta for issue under Art. 226 of the Constitution of appropriate writs or orders directing the Income-tax Officer not to proceed to assess it on the basis of these notices. The first ground on which this prayer was based was mentioned in the petition in these terms:-" The said pretended notice was issued without the existence of the necessary conditions precedent which confers jurisdiction under section 34 aforementioned, whether before or after the amendment in 1948 ". The other ground urged was that the amendment to s. 34 of the Income-tax Act in 1948 was not retrospective and that the assessment for the years 1942-43, 1943-44 and 1944-45 became barred long before March 1951.
The Trial Judge held that the first ground was not made out but being of opinion that the amending Act of 1948 was not retrospective, he held that the notices issued were without jurisdiction. Accordingly he made an order prohibiting the Income-tax Officer from continuing the assessment proceedings on the basis of the impugned notices. The learned Judges who heard the appeal agreed with the Trial Judge that the first ground had not been made out. They held however that in consequence of the amendment of s. 34 in 1948 the objection on the ground of limitation must also fail. A point of constitutional law which appears to have been raised before the appeal court was also rejected. The appeal was allowed and the company's application under Art. 226 was dismissed with costs.
Para 5:-" With reference to paragraphs 2 and 3 of the said petition, I crave reference to the assessment orders therein mentioned. The assessment order dated the 15th February, 1945, was made by Shri Kali Das Banerjee now Income Tax Officer Companies District in II and the other two assessment orders were made by Mr. L. D. Razario who is now in the employment of M/s. Lovelock & Lewis. I find from the notes made by me in the order sheet of the assessment year 1944-45 and my order dated the 7th July, 1944, that Mr. Smith of Messrs. Lovelock & Lewis attended before me and stated that the profits of the company arising out of dealings in shares were not taxable as the company was not a dealer in shares and securities. Subsequently on the 18th August, 1944, Messrs. Lovelock & Lewis wrote a letter to me setting out the contentions of their clients and inter alia stated that throughout the whole of its history the company bought no shares whatsoever. Shri K. D. Banerjee was accordingly led to believe that the dealings in shares were casual transactions and were in the nature of mere change in investments and the profits resulting therefrom were not taxable. The assessment orders were made on the basis that the petitioner did not carry on any business dealing in shares. A copy of the said letter dated the 18th August, 1944, as also the relevant portion of the note sheet are included in the schedule hereto annexed and marked " A "." Para 6:- " In the assessments for 1945-46, and 1946-47 which were completed in April, 1950, the profits on sale of shares were included in the total assessable income of the company it having been then discovered that the petitioner was in fact carrying on business in shares contrary to its representation that it was not. The company filed appeals before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner which were rejected in September, 1950, and the assessments were confirmed. The company thereafter filed a second appeal before this Income-tax Tribunal which appeals are now pending."	Facts
Sachin Chaudhury, Sukumar Mitter, S. N. Mukherjee and D. N. Ghosh, for the appellant.
It appears from this that the statements made by or on behalf of the company which the assessing authority considered to amount to non-disclosure of material facts were these:-(i) the company was not whole of its history the company bought no shares whatsoever. It has not been suggested before us that, in fact at any time up to the conclusion of the assessment proceedings for the years 1942-43, 1943-44 and 1944-45 the company did in fact make a single purchase of shares. Clearly therefore the Income-tax Officer had no reasonable ground for thinking that anything as regards the purchase of shares had not been disclosed. The company does not dispute that the statement was made on its behalf that it was not a "I dealer " in shares and securities. It appears clear that the Income-tax Officers who made the assessments for the years 1942-43, 1943-44 and 1944-45 proceeded on the basis that this was an investment company and considered the question whether in spite of its being an investment company certain sales of shares wherefrom the company made a profit were by way of trading in shares and not by way of changing the form of investment. Whether these sales by an investment company should in law be treated as trading transactions, and the profits made from the sales trading profits liable to tax, was the matter which it was the Income-tax Officer's task to decide. No duty lay on the company to admit that these transactions were by way of trade. The fact that on behalf of the company Mr. Smith of Lovelock & Lewes stated that the company was not a dealer in shares and securities does not therefore amount to an omission to disclose fully and truly any material fact. To ascertain whether the Income-tax Officer could have had in mind any non-disclosure as a ground for thinking that by reason of such non-disclosure an under assessment had occurred-apart from what was mentioned in the affidavit-we enquired from respondent's counsel whether he could suggest any other non-disclosure that might have taken place. Mr. Sastri suggested two. One is that the sales had not been disclosed; the other that the memorandum and articles of association of the company had not been shown. This suggestion is against the record and we have no hesitation in repelling it. Not only is it not the ground set out by the Income-tax Officer at any stage-not even in the affidavit in court, but the ,matters mentioned by the officer that the assessee had claimed that the profits realised were of a casual nature obviously indicate that the assessee disclosed ,that a surplus resulted from the sales which were also disclosed. The assessment orders it is true do not mention the details of the sales. They state however that the audited accounts of the company were furnished. The sales of shares were expressly mentioned in the report. In these circumstances it is reasonable to believe that as regards sale of shares full details were in fact disclosed.
It must therefore be held that the Income-tax Officer who issued the notices had not before him any non-disclosure of a material fact and so he could have no material before him for believing that there had been any material non- disclosure by reason of which an under-assessment had taken place.
The appellant Company applied to the Calcutta High Court for a writ Under Art. 226 which was granted by a learned single Judge; but the order was, reversed on appeal in the High Court. The appellant Company has now appealed on a certificate under Art. 133(1)(c) of the Constitution. The contention of the appellant Company is that all the facts necessary to be disclosed were, in fact, disclosed, that it was not required further to concede that it was trading in shares, which was a matter of inference, from' the proved facts, for the Income-tax Officer to draw, and that there was thus no question of any non disclosure. This argument overlooks the addition of the Explanation to the section, which explains cl. (a) of the first sub-section.. It reads:
By these averments, the Income Tax Officer asserted (a) that he had reasons to believe that by reason of the omission or failure of the company to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for the assessment, income chargeable to income tax has been underassessed and that he had recorded his reasons in that behalf in the three reports submitted by him to the Commissioner; (b) that in the course of the assessment proceeding for the year 1944-45, it was represented on behalf of the company that the sales of shares in that year were casual transactions and were in the nature of " mere change in investments " ; (c) that in the orders of assessment for the years 1945-46 and 1946-47 passed in April, 1950, profits earned by sale of shares held by the company were included in the total assessable income of the company, it having been discovered that the company was in fact carrying on the business of selling shares contrary to its earlier representations; and (d) that by its Memorandum and Articles of Association, the company was authorised to carry on the business of diverse kinds specified in sub-cls. (1) to (32) of cl. (3) thereof. Whereas by a mere bald assertion made by the company in its petition it was averred that the conditions precedent to the exercise of jurisdiction to re-assess did not exist, the Income Tax Officer stated in his rejoinder that he had reasons to believe that income bad been underassessed and he also set out the grounds on which that belief was founded. The existence of the reasons to believe that income was underassessed has, as already observed, not been challenged; nor is the court concerned with the question whether the materials may be regarded by a court before which a dispute is raised, sufficient to sustain the belief entertained by the Income Tax Officer. It is clear that the Income Tax Officer asserted on oath that when he issued the notice for reassessment, he had reasons to believe that income of the company had been underassessed and he set out the reasons in support of the belief.
Counsel for the company submitted that all the material facts necessary for the assessment were fully and truly disclosed in the course of the assessment for the years in question, and if the Income Tax Officer did not draw the correct inference, the jurisdiction to reassess could not be invoked. He urged that it was for the Income Tax Officer, on the preliminary facts disclosed to him, to raise his inference of fact and to base his conclusions on the preliminary as well as the inferential facts, and if, in arriving at his conclusion on the preliminary and the inferential facts., the Income Tax Officer committed an error, he could not seek to commence proceedings for reassessment on being apprised of the error. It was said that the Income Tax Officer knew that the company was an investment corporation, that the shares held by the company were sold from time to time, and that profits were earned by the sale of those shares, and that on these materials the Income Tax Officer might have held that the company was a dealer in shares, but if he did not draw that inference, the under assessment, if any, was not by reason of failure to disclose fully and truly all material facts. Counsel submitted that the condition of the exercise of jurisdiction under s. 34 is failure to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for assessment and not failure to instruct the Income Tax Officer about the legal inference to be drawn from the facts disclosed.

K. N. Rajagopal Sastri and D. Gupta, for the respondents. 1960. November 1. The Judgment of S. K. Das, K. C. Das Gupta and N. Rajagopala Ayyangar, JJ., was delivered by K. C. Das Gupta, J. M. Hidayatullah, J. and J. C. Shah, J., delivered separate Judgments.
(2) We changed industrial shares into trustee securities because I in or about 1934, the trustees decided to convert the Indian Industrial Shares held by the appellant into trustee securities'."
In appeal, the High Court confirmed the order. The High Court observed that " the use of the expression " the true intention behind the sale of shares " used in the report made by the Income Tax Officer under s. 34 to the Commissioner may lack directness, but that deficiency of language was not sufficient to enable the company to contend in view of the circumstances alleged that there was no failure to disclose facts being complained of ". The High Court also observed:	Precedent
The only point raised before us is that the courts below were wrong in holding that the first ground that the notices were issued without the existence of the necessary conditions precedent which confers jurisdiction under s. 34 had not been made out. As it is no longer disputed that s. 34 as amended in 1948 applies to the present case we have to consider the section as it stood after the amendment in 1948, in deciding this question of jurisdiction. The relevant portion of the section was in these words :-
He may in cases falling under clause (a) at any time within eight years and in cases falling under clause (b) at any time within four years of the end of that year, serve on the assessee, or, if the assessee is a company, on the principal officer thereof, a notice containing all or any of the requirements which may be included in a notice under sub- section (2) of section 22 and may proceed to assess or reassess such income, profits or gains or recompute the loss or depreciation allowance; and the provisions of this Act shall, so far as may be, apply accordingly as if the notice were a notice issued under that sub-section:-
Explanation-Production before the Income-tax Officer of account-books or other evidence from which material facts could with due diligence have been' discovered by the Income-tax Officer will not necessarily amount to disclosure within the meaning of, this section."
To confer jurisdiction under this section to issue notice in respect of assessments beyond the period of four years, but within a period of eight years, from the end of the relevant year two conditions have therefore to be satisfied. The first is that the Income-tax Officer must have reason to believe that income, profits or gains chargeable to income- tax have been under-assessed. The second is that he must have also reason to believe that such " under assessment "
inferences "-to draw the proper inferences being the duty imposed on the Income-fax Officer.
The following example explains the meaning. Taking the present case, I set below two statements, one .,involving full disclosure and a contention, and the other, only a contention with a material fact suppressed :
These sales, however, were not business sales but only change of investments into trustee securities as decided by the trustees.
Sub-section (1) of s. 34 of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922 (in so far it is material) stood at the relevant date when the proceedings were commenced, as follows:
section shall have effect as if for the periods of eight years and four years a period of one year was substituted. Explanation:-Production before the Income-tax Officer of account books or other evidence from which material facts could with due diligence have been discovered by the Income- tax Officer will not necessarily amount to disclosure within the meaning of this section.
This section provides machinery for assessment or reassessment if it be found that income, profits or gains "
The plea raised by counsel for the company must be examined in the light of the Explanation to sub-S. (1) of S. 34. The Explanation provides that " Production before the Income Tax Officer of account books or other evidence from which material facts could with due diligence have been discovered by the Income Tax Officer will not necessarily amount to disclosure within the meaning of the section." If pro- duction of documents or other evidence from which material facts could with due diligence have been discovered does not necessarily amount to disclosure, it would be difficult to hold that a presumption about the production of a document at sometime in the past and its possible existence in the files of the Income Tax Officer relating to earlier years may be regarded as sufficient disclosure. Disclosure of some facts, but not all, though the facts not disclosed may have come to the knowledge of the Income Tax Officer, if he had carefully prosecuted an enquiry on the facts and materials disclosed, will not amount to a full and true disclosure of all material facts necessary for the purpose of assessment. A tax payer cannot resist reassessment on the plea that non-disclosure of the true state of affairs was due to the negligence or inadvertence on the part of the Income Tax Officer, and but for such negligence or inadvertence, a full and true disclosure of all material facts necessary, for the assessment would have been resulted.	Section
We have therefore come to the Conclusion that while the duty of the assessee is to disclose fully and truly all primary relevant facts, it does not extend beyond this. The position therefore is that if there were in fact some reasonable grounds for thinking that there had been any non- disclosure as regards any primary fact, which could have a material bearing on the question of "under assessments that would be sufficient to give jurisdiction to the Income-tax Officer to issue the notice,% under s. 34. Whether these grounds were adequate or not for arriving at the conclusion that there was a non disclosure of material facts would not be open for the court's investigation. In other words, all that is necessary to give this special jurisdiction is that the Income-tax officer had when he assumed jurisdiction some prima facie grounds for thinking that there had been some non-disclosure of material facts.
We are therefore bound to hold that the conditions precedent to the exercise of jurisdiction under s. 34 of the Income- tax Act did not exist and the Income-tax Officer had therefore no jurisdiction to issue the impugned notices under s. 34 in respect of the years 1942-43, 1943-44 and 1944-45 after the expiry of four years.
In my opinion, the Divisional Bench of the High Court rightly refused a writ in the circumstances, and I would dismiss this appeal with costs.
SHAH J.-I regret inability to agree with the judgment delivered by my learned brother Mr. Justice Das Gupta. The facts which give rise to this appeal have been fully set out by my learned brother and it is not necessary to reiterate the same.
Para 7:- " With reference to paragraph 5 of the said petition, I deny that I pretended to act under s. 34 of the Income Tax Act as alleged. I have reasons to believe that by reason of the omission or failure of the company to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for its assessments, the income, profits or, and gains chargeable to income-tax had been underassessed.I recorded my reasons and made 3 reports (one for each year) in the prescribed form and submitted them before the Commissioner of Income Tax and the latter was satisfied that it was a fit case for issue of a notice under s. 34 of the Income Tax Act. Thereafter issued prescribed notices under s. 34 of the Income Tax Act. The said reports were made and notices issued in respect of all the three years mentioned in the petition and copies of the report and notice for one of such years are included in the schedule hereto annexed and marked " A ". The report and notices for the two other years are exactly similar.
In that view, the proper order to pass in this appeal would be one of dismissal with costs.
BY COURT.-In view of the majority opinion, the appeal is allowed with costs here and below.	Conclusion
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 197 of 1954. Appeal from the Judgment and Order dated the 25th March, 1953, of the Calcutta High Court in Appeal from Original Order No. 54 of 1953.
Sachin Chaudhury, Sukumar Mitter, S. N. Mukherjee and D. N. Ghosh, for the appellant.
K. N. Rajagopal Sastri and D. Gupta, for the respondents. 1960. November 1. The Judgment of S. K. Das, K. C. Das Gupta and N. Rajagopala Ayyangar, JJ., was delivered by K. C. Das Gupta, J. M. Hidayatullah, J. and J. C. Shah, J., delivered separate Judgments.
DAS GUPTA J.-This appeal is against an appellate decision of a Bench of the Calcutta High Court by which in reversal of the order made by the Trial Judge the Bench rejected the present appellant's application under Art. 226 of the Constitution. The appellant is a private limited company incorporated under the Indian Company's Act and has its registered office in Calcutta. It was assessed to income- tax for the assessment years, 1942-43, 1943-44- and 1944-45 by three separate orders dated January 26, 1944, February 12, 1944, and February 15, 1945, respectively. These assessments were,made under s. 23(3) of the Indian Income- tax Act upon returns filed by it accompanied by statements of account. The first two assessments were made by Mr. L. D. Rozario the then Income-tax Officer and the last one by Mr. K. D. Banerjee. The taxes assessed were duly paid up. On March 28, 1951, three notices purporting to be under s. 34 of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, were issued by the income-tax Officer calling upon the company to submit fresh returns of its total income and the total world income assessable for the three accounting years relating to the three assessment years, 1942-43 1943-44 and 1944-45. The appellant company furnished re. turns in compliance with the notices but on September 18, 1951, applied to the High Court of Calcutta for issue under Art. 226 of the Constitution of appropriate writs or orders directing the Income-tax Officer not to proceed to assess it on the basis of these notices. The first ground on which this prayer was based was mentioned in the petition in these terms:-" The said pretended notice was issued without the existence of the necessary conditions precedent which confers jurisdiction under section 34 aforementioned, whether before or after the amendment in 1948 ". The other ground urged was that the amendment to s. 34 of the Income-tax Act in 1948 was not retrospective and that the assessment for the years 1942-43, 1943-44 and 1944-45 became barred long before March 1951.
The Trial Judge held that the first ground was not made out but being of opinion that the amending Act of 1948 was not retrospective, he held that the notices issued were without jurisdiction. Accordingly he made an order prohibiting the Income-tax Officer from continuing the assessment proceedings on the basis of the impugned notices. The learned Judges who heard the appeal agreed with the Trial Judge that the first ground had not been made out. They held however that in consequence of the amendment of s. 34 in 1948 the objection on the ground of limitation must also fail. A point of constitutional law which appears to have been raised before the appeal court was also rejected. The appeal was allowed and the company's application under Art. 226 was dismissed with costs.
The Company has preferred the present appeal on the strength of a certificate issued by the High Court under Art. 133(1)(a) of the Constitution.
The only point raised before us is that the courts below were wrong in holding that the first ground that the notices were issued without the existence of the necessary conditions precedent which confers jurisdiction under s. 34 had not been made out. As it is no longer disputed that s. 34 as amended in 1948 applies to the present case we have to consider the section as it stood after the amendment in 1948, in deciding this question of jurisdiction. The relevant portion of the section was in these words :-
He may in cases falling under clause (a) at any time within eight years and in cases falling under clause (b) at any time within four years of the end of that year, serve on the assessee, or, if the assessee is a company, on the principal officer thereof, a notice containing all or any of the requirements which may be included in a notice under sub- section (2) of section 22 and may proceed to assess or reassess such income, profits or gains or recompute the loss or depreciation allowance; and the provisions of this Act shall, so far as may be, apply accordingly as if the notice were a notice issued under that sub-section:-
section shall have effect as if for the periods of eight years and four years a period of one year was substituted.
Explanation-Production before the Income-tax Officer of account-books or other evidence from which material facts could with due diligence have been' discovered by the Income-tax Officer will not necessarily amount to disclosure within the meaning of, this section."
To confer jurisdiction under this section to issue notice in respect of assessments beyond the period of four years, but within a period of eight years, from the end of the relevant year two conditions have therefore to be satisfied. The first is that the Income-tax Officer must have reason to believe that income, profits or gains chargeable to income- tax have been under-assessed. The second is that he must have also reason to believe that such " under assessment "
inferences "-to draw the proper inferences being the duty imposed on the Income-fax Officer.
We have therefore come to the Conclusion that while the duty of the assessee is to disclose fully and truly all primary relevant facts, it does not extend beyond this. The position therefore is that if there were in fact some reasonable grounds for thinking that there had been any non- disclosure as regards any primary fact, which could have a material bearing on the question of "under assessments that would be sufficient to give jurisdiction to the Income-tax Officer to issue the notice,% under s. 34. Whether these grounds were adequate or not for arriving at the conclusion that there was a non disclosure of material facts would not be open for the court's investigation. In other words, all that is necessary to give this special jurisdiction is that the Income-tax officer had when he assumed jurisdiction some prima facie grounds for thinking that there had been some non-disclosure of material facts.
Clearly it is the duty of the assessee who wants the court to hold that jurisdiction was lacking, to establish that the Income-tax Officer had no material at all before him for believing that there had been such non disclosure. To establish this the company has relied on the statements in the assessment orders for the three years in question and on the statement of Kanakendra Narayan Banerjee in the report made by him to the Commissioner of Income-tax for the purpose of obtaining sanction to initiate proceedings tinder s. 34 and also on his statement in the affidavit on oath in reply to the writ petition. The report is in these words:-
The only nondisclosure mentioned in the report is that the company had failed to disclose " the true intention behind the sale of the shares ". Mr. Choudhury contends that this is not an omission to disclose a material fact within the meaning of s. 34. The question whether sales of certain shares were by way of changing the investments or by way of trading in shares has to be decided on a consideration of different circumstances, including the frequency of the sales, the nature of the shares sold, the price received as compared with the cost price, and several other relevant facts. It is the duty of the assessee to disclose all the facts which have a bearing on the question; but whether the assessee had the intention to make a business profit as distinguished from the intention to change the form of the investments is really an inference to be drawn by the assessing authority from the material facts taken in conjunction with the surrounding circumstances. The law does not require the assessee to state the conclusion that could reasonable drawn from the primary facts. The question of the assessee's intention is an inferential fact and so the assessee's omission to state his " true intentions behind the sale of shares " cannot by itself be considered to be a failure or omission to disclose any material fact within the meaning of s. 34. Indeed, an assessee whose contention is that the shares were sold to change the form of investment and not with the intention of making a business profit cannot be expected to say that his true intention was other than what he contended it to be.. Dealing with this question the learned Chief Justice has said:-
The learned Chief Justice seems to have proceeded on the basis that when from certain facts inferences are to be drawn there is a duty on the assessee to state what the correct inference should be and if he has made a wrong statement as regards the inferences to be drawn that also is an " omission or failure to disclose a material fact ". For the reasons given earlier we do not think that this is the correct position in law.
It is clear therefore that if one looked at this report only it would not be possible to say that the Income. tax Officer had any non-disclosure of material facts by the assessee in mind when he assumed jurisdiction. It has to be remembered however that in sending a report to the Commissioner the Income-tax Officer might not fully set out what he thought amounted to a non-disclosure, because it is conceivable that the report may not be drawn up carefully and may not contain a reference to all the non-disclosures that operated on his mind. We have however on the record an affidavit sworn by the same Income-tax Officer who started the s. 34 proceedings. It is reasonable to expect that in this affidavit which was his opportunity to tell the court what non-disclosure he took into consideration he would state as clearly as possible the material facts in respect of which there had not been in his view a full and true disclosure. Mr. Banerjee's statements in this matter are contained in paras. 5, 6 and 7 of his affidavit. They are in these words:-
The report and notices for the two other years are exactly similar."
It appears from this that the statements made by or on behalf of the company which the assessing authority considered to amount to non-disclosure of material facts were these:-(i) the company was not whole of its history the company bought no shares whatsoever. It has not been suggested before us that, in fact at any time up to the conclusion of the assessment proceedings for the years 1942-43, 1943-44 and 1944-45 the company did in fact make a single purchase of shares. Clearly therefore the Income-tax Officer had no reasonable ground for thinking that anything as regards the purchase of shares had not been disclosed. The company does not dispute that the statement was made on its behalf that it was not a "I dealer " in shares and securities. It appears clear that the Income-tax Officers who made the assessments for the years 1942-43, 1943-44 and 1944-45 proceeded on the basis that this was an investment company and considered the question whether in spite of its being an investment company certain sales of shares wherefrom the company made a profit were by way of trading in shares and not by way of changing the form of investment. Whether these sales by an investment company should in law be treated as trading transactions, and the profits made from the sales trading profits liable to tax, was the matter which it was the Income-tax Officer's task to decide. No duty lay on the company to admit that these transactions were by way of trade. The fact that on behalf of the company Mr. Smith of Lovelock & Lewes stated that the company was not a dealer in shares and securities does not therefore amount to an omission to disclose fully and truly any material fact. To ascertain whether the Income-tax Officer could have had in mind any non-disclosure as a ground for thinking that by reason of such non-disclosure an under assessment had occurred-apart from what was mentioned in the affidavit-we enquired from respondent's counsel whether he could suggest any other non-disclosure that might have taken place. Mr. Sastri suggested two. One is that the sales had not been disclosed; the other that the memorandum and articles of association of the company had not been shown. This suggestion is against the record and we have no hesitation in repelling it. Not only is it not the ground set out by the Income-tax Officer at any stage-not even in the affidavit in court, but the ,matters mentioned by the officer that the assessee had claimed that the profits realised were of a casual nature obviously indicate that the assessee disclosed ,that a surplus resulted from the sales which were also disclosed. The assessment orders it is true do not mention the details of the sales. They state however that the audited accounts of the company were furnished. The sales of shares were expressly mentioned in the report. In these circumstances it is reasonable to believe that as regards sale of shares full details were in fact disclosed.
Nor can we believe that the two Income-tax Officers L. D. Rozario and K. D. Banerjee concluded the proceedings without referring to the memorandum and articles of association of the company. These officers known well that the company was claiming to be an investment company only. They had to consider the question whether sales were of the nature of trade or of the nature of change of investment. It is unthinkable that they would not examine the memorandum of association. Besides, it is pertinent to note that in para. 4 of his affidavit Kanakendra Narayan Banerjee refers to the Memorandum and articles of Association and states that " by its memorandum of association the company has been authorised to carry. on the various kinds of business which have been specified in sub-section (1) and (2) of cl. 3 of the said memorandum of associations He does not say that the articles or the memorandum of association were not shown during the assessment proceedings for the years 1942-43, 1943-44 and 1944-45. If he had any reason to believe that these were not shown he would have certainly mentioned that fact. For that would undoubtedly to non-disclosure of a material fact.
It must therefore be held that the Income-tax Officer who issued the notices had not before him any non-disclosure of a material fact and so he could have no material before him for believing that there had been any material non- disclosure by reason of which an under-assessment had taken place.
We are therefore bound to hold that the conditions precedent to the exercise of jurisdiction under s. 34 of the Income- tax Act did not exist and the Income-tax Officer had therefore no jurisdiction to issue the impugned notices under s. 34 in respect of the years 1942-43, 1943-44 and 1944-45 after the expiry of four years.
Mr. Sastri argued that the question whether the Income-tax Officer had reason to believe that under assessment had occurred " by reason of nondisclosure of material facts "
The appellant Company applied to the Calcutta High Court for a writ Under Art. 226 which was granted by a learned single Judge; but the order was, reversed on appeal in the High Court. The appellant Company has now appealed on a certificate under Art. 133(1)(c) of the Constitution. The contention of the appellant Company is that all the facts necessary to be disclosed were, in fact, disclosed, that it was not required further to concede that it was trading in shares, which was a matter of inference, from' the proved facts, for the Income-tax Officer to draw, and that there was thus no question of any non disclosure. This argument overlooks the addition of the Explanation to the section, which explains cl. (a) of the first sub-section.. It reads:
This means quite clearly that the mere production of evidence is not enough, and that there may be an omission or failure to make a full and true disclosure if some material fact necessary for the assessment lies embedded in that evidence which the assessee can uncover but does not. If there is such a fact, it is the duty of the assessee to disclose it. The evidence which is produced by the assessee discloses only primary facts, but to interpret the evidence, certain other facts may be necessary. Thus, questions of status, agency, benami nature of transactions, the nature of trading and like matters may not appear from the evidence produced, unless disclosed. If it be merely a question of interpretation of evidence by an Income-tax Officer from whom nothing has been hidden and to whom everything has been fully disclosed, then the assessee cannot be subjected to s. 34, merely because the Income-tax Officer miscarried in his interpretation of evidence. But it is otherwise, if a contention which is contrary to fact, is raised and the Income-tax Officer is set to discover the hidden truth for himself In the latter case, there is suppression of material fact, or, in other words, that lack of full and true disclosure which would entitle action under s. 34 of the Act.
The following example explains the meaning. Taking the present case, I set below two statements, one .,involving full disclosure and a contention, and the other, only a contention with a material fact suppressed :
These sales, however, were not business sales but only change of investments into trustee securities as decided by the trustees.
(2) We changed industrial shares into trustee securities because I in or about 1934, the trustees decided to convert the Indian Industrial Shares held by the appellant into trustee securities'."
If the first is decided in favour of the assessee, there is an inference or decision by the Income-tax Officer from a full and true disclosure. If the second is decided in favour of the assessee, the question would arise if there was full and true disclosure.
In the present case, the question whether the transactions were casual transactions of changing investments or regular trading in stocks and shares involves not merely an inference, because the inference depends upon the fact that the appellant Company was formed to trade in stocks and shares. It was open to the appellant Company to contend that in spite of its business, a particular transaction was this and not that. But, if the appellant Company was an investment Company dealing in stocks and shares' and knowing this for a fact, did not disclose the fact, the statement was neither full nor true, as it involved a suppression of a material fact necessary for the assessment. The Explanation is quite obviously meant to reach an identical situation. The appellant Company might have placed the evidence before the income-tax Officer, but the Income-tax Officer had reason to believe that the disclosure was neither full nor true, because the fact that the Company was and shares was not disclosed. The Income-tax Officer in his report meant no more than this. He, therefore, felt that, prima facie, there was not only concealment of a fact but, on the contrary, maintaining of a falsehood, and this was sufficient to bring this matter within the extended period. Every contention contrary to the Income-tax Officer's opinion is not necessarily concealment of a material fact, but some contentions made with a mental reservation as to the true state of affairs may amount to such concealment, if they involve non-disclosure of facts related to other facts and known to the assessee.
The Company still persists that the sales of shares were casual transactions, and this contention will, no doubt, be decided hereafter. But the question will be decided after taking into consideration the nature of the business of the Company, and till that is done, the Income-tax Officer believes that the contention raise before and persisted in is not a mere contention but maintenance of a falsehood about the nature of the transactions and the business of the Company. The existence of such a belief is sufficiently established by the report of the Income-tax Officer and the satisfaction of the Commissioner, and this has not been gainsaid.
In my opinion, the Divisional Bench of the High Court rightly refused a writ in the circumstances, and I would dismiss this appeal with costs.
SHAH J.-I regret inability to agree with the judgment delivered by my learned brother Mr. Justice Das Gupta. The facts which give rise to this appeal have been fully set out by my learned brother and it is not necessary to reiterate the same.
Sub-section (1) of s. 34 of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922 (in so far it is material) stood at the relevant date when the proceedings were commenced, as follows:
section shall have effect as if for the periods of eight years and four years a period of one year was substituted. Explanation:-Production before the Income-tax Officer of account books or other evidence from which material facts could with due diligence have been discovered by the Income- tax Officer will not necessarily amount to disclosure within the meaning of this section.
This section provides machinery for assessment or reassessment if it be found that income, profits or gains "
The notices issued by the Income Tax Officer in the case before us undoubtedly fulfil conditions (2) and (3). Notices of reassessment were served before the expiry of eight years of the end of the relevant years of assessment. The Income Tax Officer also recorded his reasons in the reports submitted by him to the Commissioner and the Commissioner was satisfied that they were fit cases for the issue of such notices. The dispute in the appeal relates merely to the fulfilment of the two branches of the first condition and that immediately raises the question about the true import of the expression "has reason to believe" in s. 34(1)(a). The expression " reason to believe " postulates belief and the existence of reasons for that belief. The belief must be held in good faith: it cannot be merely a pretence. The expression does not mean a purely subjective satisfaction of the Income Tax Officer: the forum of decision as to the existence of reasons and the belief is not in the mind of the Income Tax Officer. If it be asserted that the Income Tax Officer had reason to believe that income had been underassessed by reason of failure to disclose fully and truly the facts material for assessment, the existence of the belief and the reasons for the belief, but not the sufficiency of the reasons, will be justiciable. The expression therefore predicates that the Income Tax Officer holds the belief induced by the existence of reasons for holding such belief. It contemplates existence of reasons on which the belief is founded, and not merely a belief in the existence of reasons inducing the belief; in other words, the Income Tax Officer must on information at his disposal believe that income has been underassessed by reason of failure fully and truly to disclose all material facts necessary for assessment. Such a belief, be it said, may not be based on mere suspicion: it must be founded upon information. That the Income Tax Officer has reason to believe that there was under assessment in the material years was not challenged by the appellant and in our opinion rightly. There are on the record the reports of the Income Tax Officer in which the belief is expressly set out. It also appears from the assessment orders for the years 1945-46 and 1946-47 that tax has been assessed on the profits made by sale of shares by the company in those years. Had the Income Tax Officer reason to believe that by reason of failure to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for assessment for the three years in question, there had resulted underassessment ? The learned Trial judge, after setting out the evidence, held that the Income Tax Officer had materials before him showing that the company's trading from year to year disclosed that it had been systematically carrying on a trade in the sale of shares and securities. He observed:
In appeal, the High Court confirmed the order. The High Court observed that " the use of the expression " the true intention behind the sale of shares " used in the report made by the Income Tax Officer under s. 34 to the Commissioner may lack directness, but that deficiency of language was not sufficient to enable the company to contend in view of the circumstances alleged that there was no failure to disclose facts being complained of ". The High Court also observed:
Prima facie, the finding recorded by the Court of First Instance and confirmed by the Court of Appeal is one on a question of fact and this court would not be justified in entering upon a reappraisal of the evidence. But it is contended on behalf of the company that the finding is based on no materials, and to that plea I may advert. By s. 22 of the Income Tax Act, a duty is imposed upon every tax payer whose total income exceeds the maximum which is not chargeable to income-tax to make a return in the prescribed form and verified in the prescribed manner, setting forth his total income during that year. If the tax payer making the return fails to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for the assessment of the year in question, the jurisdiction of the Income Tax Officer to reassess is invited. The company in its petition for the issue of a writ contended by paragraph 7 that the notices were ultra vires and illegal and that the Income Tax Officer was not invested with jurisdiction to proceed thereunder, inter alia, for the reason-that the " pretended notice was issued without the existence of the necessary conditions precedent which confers jurisdiction under s. 34 aforementioned, whether before or after amendment in 1948." The Income Tax Officer, by his affidavit, submitted:
Para 5:-" With reference to paragraphs 2 and 3 of the said petition, I crave reference to the assessment orders therein mentioned. The assessment order dated the 15th February, 1945, was made by Shri Kali Das Banerjee now Income Tax Officer Companies District in II and the other two assessment orders were made by Mr. L. D. Razario who is now in the employment of M/s. Lovelock & Lewis. I find from the notes made by me in the order sheet of the assessment year 1944-45 and my order dated the 7th July, 1944, that Mr. Smith of Messrs. Lovelock & Lewis attended before me and stated that the profits of the company arising out of dealings in shares were not taxable as the company was not a dealer in shares and securities. Subsequently on the 18th August, 1944, Messrs. Lovelock & Lewis wrote a letter to me setting out the contentions of their clients and inter alia stated that throughout the whole of its history the company bought no shares whatsoever. Shri K. D. Banerjee was accordingly led to believe that the dealings in shares were casual transactions and were in the nature of mere change in investments and the profits resulting therefrom were not taxable. The assessment orders were made on the basis that the petitioner did not carry on any business dealing in shares. A copy of the said letter dated the 18th August, 1944, as also the relevant portion of the note sheet are included in the schedule hereto annexed and marked " A "." Para 6:- " In the assessments for 1945-46, and 1946-47 which were completed in April, 1950, the profits on sale of shares were included in the total assessable income of the company it having been then discovered that the petitioner was in fact carrying on business in shares contrary to its representation that it was not. The company filed appeals before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner which were rejected in September, 1950, and the assessments were confirmed. The company thereafter filed a second appeal before this Income-tax Tribunal which appeals are now pending."
Para 7:- " With reference to paragraph 5 of the said petition, I deny that I pretended to act under s. 34 of the Income Tax Act as alleged. I have reasons to believe that by reason of the omission or failure of the company to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for its assessments, the income, profits or, and gains chargeable to income-tax had been underassessed.I recorded my reasons and made 3 reports (one for each year) in the prescribed form and submitted them before the Commissioner of Income Tax and the latter was satisfied that it was a fit case for issue of a notice under s. 34 of the Income Tax Act. Thereafter issued prescribed notices under s. 34 of the Income Tax Act. The said reports were made and notices issued in respect of all the three years mentioned in the petition and copies of the report and notice for one of such years are included in the schedule hereto annexed and marked " A ". The report and notices for the two other years are exactly similar.
By these averments, the Income Tax Officer asserted (a) that he had reasons to believe that by reason of the omission or failure of the company to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for the assessment, income chargeable to income tax has been underassessed and that he had recorded his reasons in that behalf in the three reports submitted by him to the Commissioner; (b) that in the course of the assessment proceeding for the year 1944-45, it was represented on behalf of the company that the sales of shares in that year were casual transactions and were in the nature of " mere change in investments " ; (c) that in the orders of assessment for the years 1945-46 and 1946-47 passed in April, 1950, profits earned by sale of shares held by the company were included in the total assessable income of the company, it having been discovered that the company was in fact carrying on the business of selling shares contrary to its earlier representations; and (d) that by its Memorandum and Articles of Association, the company was authorised to carry on the business of diverse kinds specified in sub-cls. (1) to (32) of cl. (3) thereof. Whereas by a mere bald assertion made by the company in its petition it was averred that the conditions precedent to the exercise of jurisdiction to re-assess did not exist, the Income Tax Officer stated in his rejoinder that he had reasons to believe that income bad been underassessed and he also set out the grounds on which that belief was founded. The existence of the reasons to believe that income was underassessed has, as already observed, not been challenged; nor is the court concerned with the question whether the materials may be regarded by a court before which a dispute is raised, sufficient to sustain the belief entertained by the Income Tax Officer. It is clear that the Income Tax Officer asserted on oath that when he issued the notice for reassessment, he had reasons to believe that income of the company had been underassessed and he set out the reasons in support of the belief.
Counsel for the company submitted that all the material facts necessary for the assessment were fully and truly disclosed in the course of the assessment for the years in question, and if the Income Tax Officer did not draw the correct inference, the jurisdiction to reassess could not be invoked. He urged that it was for the Income Tax Officer, on the preliminary facts disclosed to him, to raise his inference of fact and to base his conclusions on the preliminary as well as the inferential facts, and if, in arriving at his conclusion on the preliminary and the inferential facts., the Income Tax Officer committed an error, he could not seek to commence proceedings for reassessment on being apprised of the error. It was said that the Income Tax Officer knew that the company was an investment corporation, that the shares held by the company were sold from time to time, and that profits were earned by the sale of those shares, and that on these materials the Income Tax Officer might have held that the company was a dealer in shares, but if he did not draw that inference, the under assessment, if any, was not by reason of failure to disclose fully and truly all material facts. Counsel submitted that the condition of the exercise of jurisdiction under s. 34 is failure to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for assessment and not failure to instruct the Income Tax Officer about the legal inference to be drawn from the facts disclosed.
The duty imposed by the Act upon the tax payer is to make a full and true disclosure of all material facts necessary for the assessment; he is not required to inform the Income Tax Officer as to what legal inference should be drawn from the facts disclosed by him nor to advise him on questions of law. Whether on the facts found or disclosed, the company was a dealer in shares, may be regarded as a conclusion on a mixed question of law and fact and from the failure on the part of the company to disclose to the Income Tax Officer this legal inference no fault may be found with the company. But on the evidence in the case, the plea raised by the company that all material facts were disclosed cannot be accepted. The Income Tax Officer has in para. 6 of his affidavit referred to the assessment of the years 1945-46 and 1946-47: he has also referred to the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the company therein. In the assessment order for the year 1945-46, the Income Tax Officer has set out cls. (1) and (2) of the Memorandum and Articles of Association of the company. They are:
The Income Tax Officer in his order of assessment for that year observed that those clauses indicated the purposes for which the company was formed, and also that " whenever the shares were first acquired, these became the commodities which could either be held or sold according to the best interests of the company, that whenever such a commodity is sold, it comes within the activities or properly speaking the profit making scheme as enumerated in the object clauses stated above. These shares sold in course of ten or twelve years whenever opportunities occurred for earning profits on making the sales........... This company was not an ordinary trader investing its surplus funds in shares and securities quite unconnected with its regular course of business so that the profit or loss also on sale of such shares or securities may be treated as not arising out of its regular business carried on. On the other hand, it is an Investment company of which the very first object clause is to hold and deal in shares. Profit on sale of such shares therefore arises out of its regular course of business and it must be taxable."
From that order of assessment, it is manifest that the Assessing Officer held that the company was formed with the object of acquiring, holding, exchanging, selling and dealing in shares, that the shares acquired became the trading assets of the company to be disposed of when opportunities occurred for earning profits; and that the activities of selling shares in which surplus assets of the company were invested were a part of the regular business carried on by the company.
There is no evidence that the Memorandum and Articles of Association referred to in para 4 of the affidavit were produced in the course of the assessment of the relevant years; nor is there evidence to show that it was disclosed that the acquisition of shares was incidental to the business activities and out of the surplus assets of the company and that the same were sold at profit as opportunities arose. There is also no ground for assuming that these facts must have been known to the Income Tax Officer. Counsel for the company suggested somewhat casually that under the Income Tax Rules and the practice prevailing with the Income Tax Officer, the Memorandum and Articles of Association of every company which was being assessed to tax are to be filed with the Income Tax Officer. But our attention has not been invited to any rule or any material to support the existence of a practice requiring a private limited company to file with the Income Tax Officer the Memorandum and Articles of Association.
The plea raised by counsel for the company must be examined in the light of the Explanation to sub-S. (1) of S. 34. The Explanation provides that " Production before the Income Tax Officer of account books or other evidence from which material facts could with due diligence have been discovered by the Income Tax Officer will not necessarily amount to disclosure within the meaning of the section." If pro- duction of documents or other evidence from which material facts could with due diligence have been discovered does not necessarily amount to disclosure, it would be difficult to hold that a presumption about the production of a document at sometime in the past and its possible existence in the files of the Income Tax Officer relating to earlier years may be regarded as sufficient disclosure. Disclosure of some facts, but not all, though the facts not disclosed may have come to the knowledge of the Income Tax Officer, if he had carefully prosecuted an enquiry on the facts and materials disclosed, will not amount to a full and true disclosure of all material facts necessary for the purpose of assessment. A tax payer cannot resist reassessment on the plea that non-disclosure of the true state of affairs was due to the negligence or inadvertence on the part of the Income Tax Officer, and but for such negligence or inadvertence, a full and true disclosure of all material facts necessary, for the assessment would have been resulted.
There is no evidence on the record that the Memorandum and Articles of Association were ever produced before the Income Tax Officer in the course of proceedings for assessment. Again, the report of the Income 'tax Officer discloses that his predecessor in office was told that the sales of shares effected by the company were casual transactions and were in the nature of a mere " change of investments". This was not strictly accurate. The record therefore clearly shows that the company bad failed to disclose fully and truly all material facts in relation to assessment in two respects, (1) that it failed to produce the Memorandum and Articles of Association showing the purposes for which the company was incorporated, and (2)that the shares were acquired as part of the business of financiers. The company also made a statement which is partially untrue when it stated that sales were mere casual transactions. There were materials before the Income Tax Officer on which he had reason to believe that by reason of the failure of the company to fully and truly disclose material facts, its income was underassessed. Whether on these facts, a conclusion that in fact the company was carrying on the business of trading in shares could be founded, is at this stage entirely immaterial. If there was reason to believe, the alleged inadequacy of the materials on which the belief could be founded is of no moment. The Income Tax Officer has commenced proceedings for reassessment by issuing notices against the company and he has placed all the materials before the court on which it could be said that he had reason to believe that income of the company had been underassessed by reason of failure on the part of the company to disclose fully and truly all material facts relating to the assessment and if, on those materials, the Income Tax Officer could hold the belief which he says he did, the court in seeking to hold an enquiry into the question whether the Income Tax Officer, notwithstanding his affidavit and materials placed in support thereof, had reason to hold the requisite belief, would be arrogating to itself jurisdiction which it does not possess. If the conditions precedent do not exist, the jurisdiction of the High Court to issue high prerogative, writs under Art. 226 of the Constitution to prohibit action under the notice may be exercised. But if the existence of the conditions is asserted by the authority entrusted with the power and the materials on the record prima facie Support the existence of such conditions, an enquiry whether the authority could not have reasonably held the belief which he says he had reason to hold and he did hold, is, in my judgment, barred.
In that view, the proper order to pass in this appeal would be one of dismissal with costs.
BY COURT.-In view of the majority opinion, the appeal is allowed with costs here and below.	Total Judgement
