1960. October 26. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR. J.-This is a petition by six persons under article 32 of the Constitution praying for a writ of certiorari for calling the records in which certain orders were passed and for the issue of a mandamus directing the respondents to restore the property in dispute. The following pedigree table will assist in understanding the case:-
The decision of the case mainly depends upon the decision as to whether the property in dispute was composite property. Under s. 2(d) of the Separation Act composite property has been defined:	Issue
On November 22, 1949, a notice was issued to Khatoon Bibi, her manager and servants declaring her to be an evacuee and calling upon her to surrender possession of her property which was described as " Bhatni Noori (Chini Mills, zamindari and kashtkari land ". Her husband Abdul Barkat filed objections but it does not appear that any order was passed on those objections. On April 17. 1950, the Administration of Evacuee Property Act, 1950 (XXXI of 1950), hereinafter referred to as the Act, came into force. Another notice was issued to Khatoon Bibi by the Deputy Custodian of Evacuee Property, Deoria, on July 5, 1950, to show cause why she should not be declared an evacuee and why all her property be not declared evacuee property. It is alleged that the notice did not contain any description of the property and was therefore ineffective. This fact is denied by the respondents. In their affidavit it was stated that the property was fully specified and identified and that the notice of July 5, 1950, was by way of abundant caution; the property of Khatoon Bibi had become evacuee property and had automatically vested in the year 1949. Against this notice also Abdul 1951, these objections were dismissed. The order was as follows:-	Facts

These provisions were materially different from that in the previous Ordinances as there was no automatic vesting in the Custodian.	Precedent
S. 2(e) " " evacuee interest " in relation to a composite property, means the right, title and interest of ail evacuee in that property."
Therefore if it is established that any interest in the property has been declared to be evacuee property or has vested in the Custodian under the Act then the whole will be composite property. For the determination of the question whether any portion of the property in dispute was evacuee property it becomes necessary to refer to the provisions of the various laws which were passed in regard to evacuee property. The property in dispute is situate in what was the United Provinces and the first legislation in that province as it then was, was the United Provinces Administration of Evacuee Property Ordinance, 1949 (U. P. Ordinance No. 1 of 1949), which was promulgated on June 24, 1949. In this Ordinance evacuee and evacuee property had the definition which has been continued in the later Ordinances and Acts. By s. 5 of that Ordinance all evacuee property situate in the United Provinces automatically vested in the Custodian and any person in possession of such property was deemed to be holding on behalf of the Custodian (s. 6(2)). As Khatoon Bibi was an evacuee under s. 2(c) of the U. P. Ordinance her property automatically vested in the Custodian under s. 5. But the validity of this Ordinance was successfully challenged by the petitioners in the Allahabad High Court in Azimunissa v. Assistant Custodian (1). The ground for the challenge was that there was no entry in the lists in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution Act, 1935, dealing with evacuee property and there was no public notification by the Governor General as required by s. 104 of the Constitution Act, 1935. This Ordinance, i.e., U. P. Ordinance 1 of 1949 expired on August 23, 1949.
On June 13, 1949, the Governor General promulgated the Administration of Evacuee Property (Chief Commissioners' Provinces) Ordinance XII of 1949 and it was extended to U. P. on August 23, 1949, by Ordinance XX of 1949 after a resolution was passed by the U. P. Legislature under s. 103 of the Constitution Act. Section 5 of the former provides for the vesting of property in the Custodian as follows:-
Thus under s. 5 in spite of the expiry of the U. P. Ordinance the property of Khatoon Bibi was deemed to have vested in the Custodian under the provisions of Ordinance XII of 1949. But this Ordinance (XII of 1949 as amended by Ordinance XX of 1949) suffered from the same constitutional defect as the U. P. Ordinance 1 of 1949. On August 25, 1949, item 31-B relating to " evacuees " was added to the concurrent list by the Government of India Act (Third Amend- ment) Act of 1949 and thus this constitutional vacuum was filled up. On October 18, 1949, the Governor General promulgated the Administration of Evacuee Property Ordinance (XXVII of 1949). It repealed Ordinance XII of 1949. Section 7 of this Ordinance provided for declaration of evacuee property and s. 8 for vesting of evacuee property in the Custodian. The relevant portions of s. 7 are :-
Thus any vesting under Ordinance XII of 1949 was deemed to be under Ordinance XXVII of 1949 as if the latter had been in force on the date of the vesting. By s.4 of the Administration of Evacuee Property (Amendment) Ordinance IV of 1950, s. 8 of Ordinance XXVII of 1949 was substituted by a revised section s. 8. The relevant portion of this section provided:-
of the Constitution removing the constitutional objection but must be reenacted "
The second plea taken by the respondents was that by the insertion of s. 8(2A) in the Act by Act 1 of 1960 retroactive effect was given to the provisions of the Act and the vesting of any evacuee property which purported to have been vested as evacuee property in (1) [1958] S.C.R. 1422, 1469.
the Custodian was validated notwithstanding any defect in or invalidity of such law and on the commencement of that Act (Act 1 of 1960) the property which purported to have vested in the Custodian was deemed to have been evacuee property declared as, such within the meaning of the Act and any order made or action taken by the Custodian must be deemed to have been validly made or taken.
The word " purport " has many shades of meaning. It means fictitious, what appears on the face of the instrument; the apparent and not the legal import and therefore any act which purports to be done in exercise of a power is to be deemed to be done within that power notwithstanding that the power is not exercisable; Dicker v. Angerstein (1). Purporting is therefore indicative of what appears on the face of it or, is apparent even though in law it may not be so. This means that at the time when the Act purported to vest the property in dispute in the Custodian even though the power was not exercisable, s. 8(2-A) by giving a retrospective effect to s. 8(2) of the Act makes the vesting as if it was vesting under s. 8(2) of the Act and therefore the attack on the ground of invalidity cannot be sustained. By s. 5 of U. P. Ordinance 1 of 1949 the property of Khatoon Bibi who became an evacuee' under s. 2(c) and her property ' evacuee property' under s. 2(d) was vested in the Custodian of Evacuee Property of the province of U. P. That Ordinance was allowed to lapse. By Central Ordinance XII of 1949 as subsequently amended the vesting of evacuee property was deemed to be under that Ordinance, which in its turn was repealed under s. 55 of Ordinance XXVII of 1949 which was a valid piece of legislation. By s. 8(2) of that Ordinance the vesting under the previous Ordinance was deemed to be under that Ordinance as if it was in force on the date of the vesting. Ordinance XXVII of 1949 was repealed by the Act which contained provisions as to vesting in s. 8(2), which was similarly worded as the corresponding provision of the Ordinance and therefore by a fiction of law the original vesting was to be treated as (1) (1876) 3 Ch. D. 600, 603.
if the Act was in force when the first vesting took place. The High Court of Allahabad in Azimunnissa's case (1) held the vesting to be invalid because upto the time of Ordinance XII of 1949 and even Ordinance XX of 1949 legislative competence was lacking, and even by the deeming provisions in s. 8(2) of Ordinance XXVII of 1949 or Act XXXI of 1950 there was no valid vesting, because the original vesting was bad. We think it unnecessary to decide as to whether the deeming provision of s. 8(2) of the Act or of Ordinance XXVII of 1949 was sufficient to give validity to the vesting. Section 8(2-A) as introduced into the Act, in our opinion, makes the vesting valid, because it gives validity to the vesting which purported to have taken place as a result of Ordinance XXVII of 1949 even though it was only apparently so and was not so in law, because that is what I purport' implies.
The effect of s. 8(2-A) is that what purported to have vested under s. 8(2) of Ordinance XXVII of 1949 and which is to be deemed to be vested under s. 8 of the Act which repealed that Ordinance, notwithstanding any invalidity in the original vesting or any decree or order of the Court shall be deemed to be evacuee property validly vested in the Custodian and any order made by the Custodian in relation to the property shall be deemed to be valid. Thus retrospec- tive effect is given to the Act to validate (1) what purports to be vested; (2) removes all defects or invalidity in the vesting or fictional vesting under s. 8(2) of Ordinance XXVII of 1949 or s. 8(2) of the Act which repealed the Ordinance; (3) makes the decrees and judgments to the contrary of any court in regard to the vesting ineffective; (4) makes the property evacuee property by its deeming effect; and (5) validates all orders passed by the Custodian in regard to the property. Because of the retrospective effect given to the Act and the validating effect of Act 1 of 1960 Saghir Ahmad's case (2) would have no application. In the view we have taken the other question does not survive and the share of Khatoon Bibi must be held to be evacuee property validly (1) A.I.R. 1951 All. 561 (2) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 707.
vested in the Custodian. Therefore the property in dispute does fall within the definition of composite property as given in s. 2(d) and cannot be held to be invalid. It was then argued that by the sale of the property non- evacuees had been illegally deprived of their property and therefore s. 10, cl. (a) contravenes the provisions of Arts. 31 and 19(1)(f). This contention is equally unsubstantial. The relevant provision of s. 10 is as follows:--	Section

vested in the Custodian. Therefore the property in dispute does fall within the definition of composite property as given in s. 2(d) and cannot be held to be invalid. It was then argued that by the sale of the property non- evacuees had been illegally deprived of their property and therefore s. 10, cl. (a) contravenes the provisions of Arts. 31 and 19(1)(f). This contention is equally unsubstantial. The relevant provision of s. 10 is as follows:--
Thus the alternatives open to the Competent Officer were four: of these (1) the payment by the Custodian of the money value of the share of the non-evacuees to the non-evacuees; and (2) the payment to the Custodian by the non-evacuees of the money value of the share of the evacuees were not available to him. The former in this case was neither claimed nor could the Custodian be expected to pay such a large sum of money to the non-evacuees. The order of the Competent Officer of March 20, 1956, shows that the nonevacuee co-sharers were not prepared to pay to the Custodian the money value of the shares of the evacuees. of the remaining alternatives the third alternative was the partitioning of the property but that also was not possible in the present case because of the nature of the composite property which comprised of a sugar mill which in the very nature of things could not be partitioned. Consequently the only available mode of separation was the one adopted by the Custodian'. i.e., by sale of the property and division of the sale proceeds. In the circumstances the action of the Competent Officer could not be termed unreasonable or violative of Art. 19(1)(f) nor does it violate Art. 31 because it cannot be said to be deprivation of the non- evacuees of their property without the authority of law. In the result this petition fails and is dismissed with costs.
