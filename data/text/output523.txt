CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 105 of 1953. Appeal by Special Leave granted by this Court's Order dated the 24th September, 1951 from the Judgment and Decree dated the 2nd day of September, 1949 of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in Appeal No. 274 of 1948 from Original Decree arising out of the Decree dated the 30th day of July, 1946 of the Court of Civil Judge, Senior Division at Hubli in Special Suit No. 56 of 1944.
1954. December 10. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MEHR CHAND MAHAJAN C. J.-This appeal raises a question of importance "whether a widow can exercise a power of adoption conferred on her or possessed by her at any time during her life irrespective of any devolution of property or changes in the family or other circumstances and even after a grandson has come on the scene but has subsequently died without leaving a widow or a son".
The situation in which this question arises can properly be appreciated by reference to the following genealogy:	Issue

The following quotation from the judgment of Lord Kingsdown may be cited as indicating the reasons for the decisions:
In the result the suit of Ram Kishore was dismissed. After the deaths of Bhoobun Moyee and Chundrabullee, Ram Kishore got possession of the property under a deed of relinquishment executed in 1869 in his favour by Chundrabullee, who herself had entered into possession of the property as mother and next heir of Bhowanee Kishore after the death of Bboobun Moyee in 1867. If Ram Kishore's adoption was good he was undoubtedly the next heir to the property. A distant collateral however claimed the estate on the ground that his adoption was invalid. The Privy Council then held that "upon the vesting of the estate in the widow of Bhowanee, the power of adoption of Chudrabullee was at an end and incapable of execution" and that Ram Kishore had therefore no title. This was the decision in Padma Coomari v. Court of Wards(1) wherein a second effort to maintain the validity of his adoption by Chundrabullee was made but without success. The High Court in its judgment in Padma Coomari's case(1) remarked that the decision in Bhoobun Moyee v. Ram Kishore(2) did not decide that Chundrabullee could not adopt on the extinction of the issue either of natural-born son or of the first to be adopted son, and that if Chundrabullee had on the death of Bhoobun Moyee made the adoption and so divested her own estate,, there would be (1) [1881] L.R. 8 I.A, 229.
(2) [1865] 10 M.I.A. 279, nothing in the judgment of the Privy Council and nothing in the law to prevent her doing that which her husband authorised her to do, and which would certainly be for his spiritual benefit, and for that of his ancestors and even of Bhowanee Kishore. The learned Judges of the High Court proceeded then to observe as follows:
The question of limitations upon the power of the widow to adopt thus stated in the Chundrabulle series of decisions was again affirmed by the Judicial Committee in Thayammal and Kuttiswami Aiyan v. Venkatarama Aiyan(1) decided in 1887 and in Tarachurn v. Suresh Chunder(2) decided in 1889.
In the year 1902 this question came up for consideration before the Full Bench of the Bombay High Court in Ramkrishna Ramchandra v. Shamrao(3). There a grandmother succeeded to her grandson who died unmarried andit was held that her power to make an adoption hadcome to an end and that the adoption was invalid. Chandavarkar, J., who delivered the judgment of the Full Bench, enunciated the principle in these words:
This principle was approved and applied by the Judicial Committee in Madana Mohana v. Purushothama Deo(4) in these words:
The next and the most important decision of the Judicial Committee in regard to this matter was given in the year 1933 in Amarendra Mansingh v. Sanatan(5) where there was a departure from or at least a reorientation of the old doctrine, and stress was laid on the spiritual rather than on the temporal aspect (1) (1887] L.R. 14 I.A. 67.
of adoption, linking it up with the vesting and divesting of the estate. There a Hindu governed by the Benaras school was survived by an infant son and a widow, to whom he had given authority to adopt in the event of the son dying. The son succeeded to his father's impartible zamindari but died unmarried at the age of 20 years and 6 months. By a custom of the family which excluded females from inheritance the estate did not go to his mother but became vested in a distant collateral. A week after the son's death she made an adoption. It was held that the adoption was valid and it divested the estate vested by inheritance in the collateral. All the previous decisions were reviewed in this case by Sir George Lowndes who delivered the judgment of the Board. At page 248 of the report it is said as follows:
Having regard to this well-established doctrine as to the religious efficacy of sonship, their Lordships feel that great caution should be observed in shutting the door upon any authorised adoption by the widow of a sonless man, The Hindu law itself sets no limit to the exercise of the power during the lifetime of the widow and the validity of successive adoptions in continuance of the line is now well recognised. Nor do the authoritative texts appear to limit the exercise of the power by any considerations of property. But that there must be some limit to its exercise, or at all events some conditions in which it would be either contrary to the spirit of the Hindu doctrine to admit its continuance, or inequitable in the face of other rights to allow it to take effect, has long been recognised both by the Courts in India and by this Board, and it is upon the difficult question of where the line should be drawn, and upon what principle, that the argument in the present case has mainly turned". In another part of the judgment their Lordships observed as follows:
-the widow which remained suspended during the lifetime of the son could revive on the son dying sonless and unmarried, logically the power must also revive when the son and his widow and the grandson and his widow all died out. Reliance was also placed on the passage already cited in which their Lordships laid emphasis on the proposition that the substitution of a son of the deceased for spiritual reasons is the essence of the thing, and the consequent devolution of property a mere accessory to it and it was contended that the grounds on which an outside limit was laid on the exercise of the widow's power in the Chundrabullee series of decisions no longer survived, in view of the ratio in Amarendra's decision and that it having been held that the power of adoption did not depend on and was not linked with the devolution of property or with the question of vesting or divesting of property and could be exercised whenever necessity for continuing the line arose, it should be held that when the son and his widow were dead and the grandson to whom he handed the torch for continuing the line also died, the power of Gangabai to make the adoption revived and thus the adoption was valid. This argument, in our opinion, is not well founded as it is based on an incorrect apprehension of the true basis of the rule enunciated in this judgment, the rule being that "where the duty of providing for the continuance of the line for spiritual purposes which was upon the father and was laid by him conditionally upon the mother, has been assumed by the son and by him passed on to the grandson or to the son's widow, the mother's power is gone". In the words of Chandavarkar, J. affirmed by the Judicial Committee in Madana Mohana v. Purushothama Deo(1) "the power having once been extinguished it cannot afterwards be revived". In other words the true rule is this:
The three propositions that the Privy Council laid down in Amarendra's case therefore cannot now be questioned. These propositions may be summed up in these terms:
The rule enunciated in Amarendra's case was subsequently applied in Vijaysingji v. Shivsangji(1) and was again restated and reaffirmed as a sound rule enunciating the limitations on the widow's power to adopt in Anant Bhikappa Patil v. Shankar Ramchandra Patil(2). One of the propositions enunciated in this decision was not accepted by this court in Shrinivas Krishnarao Kango v. Narayan Devji Kango(3), but that apart no doubt was cast in this decision on the above rule.
been suggested for holding that the rule is either in- equitable or unjust or is repugnant to or inconsistent with any doctrine or theory of Hindu Law of adoption. In this situation we are bound to hold that it is too late in the day to say that there are no limitations of any kind on the widow's power to adopt excepting those that limit the power of her husband to adopt, i.e. that she cannot adopt in the presence of a son, grandson or great grandson. Hindu Law generally and in particular in matters of inheritance, alienation and adoption gives to the widow powers of a limited character and there is nothing in the limitations laid down by the course of decisions above referred to repugnant to that law. For the reasons given above, we are unable to depart from the rule that a widow's power to make an adoption comes to an end by the interposition of a grandson or the son's widow competent to continue the line by adoption.
The learned counsel for the appellant placed considerable reliance on two decisions of the Indian High Courts in support of his contention and suggested that the rule laid down in Amarendra's case had no application to the situation that has arisen in the present case and that on the death of the grandson the widow's power to adopt which was in abeyance during his life revived. Reference in this connection was made to the decision of the Nagpur High Court in Bapuji v. Gangaram(1). There a Hindu died leaving a widow and his son and the son died leaving a widow only who re-married. It was held that the power of the mother revived on the re-marriage of the son's widow. Reliance for this proposition curiously enough was placed on the decision of the Judicial Committee in Amarendra's case as appears from the following quotation from that judgment:	Precedent

of adoption, linking it up with the vesting and divesting of the estate. There a Hindu governed by the Benaras school was survived by an infant son and a widow, to whom he had given authority to adopt in the event of the son dying.

be owed is discharged, and it is upon the new generation that the duty is now cast and the burden of the "debt" is now laid.
It can, they think, hardly be doubted that in this doctrine the devolution of property, though recognised as the inherent right of the son, is altogether a secondary consideration............ that the validity of an adoption is to be determined by spiritual rather than temporal considerations; that the substitution of a son of the deceased for spiritual reasons is the essence of the thing, and the consequent devolution of property a mere accessory to it.
Having regard to this well-established doctrine as to the religious efficacy of sonship, their Lordships feel that great caution should be observed in shutting the door upon any authorised adoption by the widow of a sonless man, The Hindu law itself sets no limit to the exercise of the power during the lifetime of the widow and the validity of successive adoptions in continuance of the line is now well recognised.

In another part of the judgment their Lordships observed as follows:

-the widow which remained suspended during the lifetime of the son could revive on the son dying sonless and unmarried, logically the power must also revive when the son and his widow and the grandson and his widow all died out.

One of the propositions enunciated in this decision was not accepted by this court in Shrinivas Krishnarao Kango v.

The result of these series of decisions is, that now for about three quarters of a century the rule that "the power of a widow to adopt comes to an end by the interposition of a grandson or the son's widow competent to adopt" has become a part of Hindu Law. though the reasons for limiting the power may not be traceable to any Shastric text; and may have been differently stated in the several judgments. It is well known that in the absence of any clear Shastric text the courts have authority to decide cases on principles of justice, equity and good conscience and it is not possible to bold that the reasons stated in support of the rule are not consistent with these principles. During the arguments no substantial grounds have (1) [1935] L.R 62 I.A. 161. (2) [1943] L.R. 70 I.A. 232. (3) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 1.
