The short facts are these. One Balkrishna Purushottam Purani died on November 11, 1947. He left behind him three widows and two daughters. The three widows were named Indira, Ramluxmi and Prabhuluxmi. These widows as legal heirs inherited the estate of the deceased, which consisted of immovable properties situate in Ahmedabad, shares in Joint Stock Companies, money lying in deposit, and share in a registered firm. For the two assessment years 1950-51 and 1951-52 (the corresponding account years being the Sambat years 2005 and 2006) the Incometax Officer issued notices to the legal heirs of Balkrishna Purushottam Purani. Pursuant to those notices, returns were filed under the heading, "
For both years the Income-tax Officer took the status of the assessee as an " association of persons " and on that footing made two assessment orders. There was an appear to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, and two of the points taken before him were(a) that the three widows ought to have been assessed separately and not as an " association of persons ", and (b) that in any event, the income from property ought to have been assessed separately in the hands of the three widows by reason of the provisions in s. 9(3) of the Income-tax Act, 1922. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner rejected point (a) but accepted point (b). Then, there was a further appeal to the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal, Bombay. The Tribunal held that the entire estate of deceased Balkrishna Purushottam Purani was inherited and possessed by the three widows as joint tenants and its income was liable to be assessed in their hands in the status of an association of persons. The Tribunal further held that the Appellate Assistant Commissioner was wrong in holding that the shares of the three widows were definite and determinable and s. 9(3) was applicable. The assessee then moved the Tribunal to refer certain questions of law which arose out of its orders to the High Court of Bombay. The Tribunal referred four such questions, but we are now concerned with only one of them, viz., question No. 3 which was in the following terms:	Facts

Coming back to the facts found by the Tribunal, there is no finding that the three widows have combined in a joint enterprise to produce income. The only finding is that they have not exercised their right to separate enjoyment, and except for receiving the dividends and interest jointly, it has been found that they have done no act which has helped to produce income in respect of the shares and deposits. On these findings it cannot be held that the three widows had the status of an association of persons within the meaning of s. 3 of the Indian Income Tax Act.	RespArg

Two references were made to the High Court in respect of the orders passed for two assessment years and they gave rise to Income-tax References Nos. 52 and 53 of 1955. The leading judgment was given in T. T. It. 52 of 1955. The High Court held that the Tribunal was in error in coming to the conclusion that the three widows could be assessed in the status of an association of persons with regard to the income which they earned as heirs of their deceased husband. Therefore, it answered question No. 3 in the negative. The department represented by the Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay, then applied to this Court and obtained special leave to appeal from the judgment and orders of the High Court of Bombay in the two References. These two appeals have been filed in pursuance of the special leave granted by this Court. The appellant is the Commissioner of Income- tax, Bombay, and the assessee is the respondent. The argument on behalf of the appellant is that the High Court was in error when it said that " what is required before an association of persons can be liable to tax is not that they should receive income but that they should earn or help to earn income by reason of their association, and if the case of the Department stops short at mere receipt of income, then the Department must fail in bringing home the liability to tax of individuals as an association of persons." It is submitted that the High Court did not, in the statement quoted above, lay down the correct test for determining what is an " association of persons "
It is enough for our purpose to refer to three decisions: In re: B. N. Elias and Others (1); Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay v. Laxmidas Devidas and Another("); and In re:
a section which imposes a tax on income, the association must be one the object of which is to produce income, profits or gains. This was the view expressed by Beaumont, C. J., in Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay v. Laxmidas Devidas and Another (1) at page 589 and also in Re:	Precedent

Now, s. 3 imposes a tax " in respect of the total income...................... of every individual, Hindu un- divided family, company and local authority, and of every firm and other association of persons or the partners of the firm or members of the association individually." In the absence of any definition as to what constitutes an association of persons, we must construe the words in their plain ordinary meaning and we must also bear in mind that the words occur in a section which imposes a tax on the total income of each one of the units of assessment mentioned therein including an association of persons. The meaning to be assigned to the words must take colour from the context in which they occur. A number of decisions have been cited at the bar bearing on the question, and our attention has been drawn to the controversy as to whether the words " association of individuals " which occurred previously in the section should be read ejusdem generis with the word immediately preceding, viz., firm or with all the other groups of persons mentioned in the section. Into that controversy it is unnecessary to enter in the present case. Nor do we pause to consider the widely differing characteristics of the three other associations mentioned in the section, viz., Hindu undivided family, a company and a firm, and whether in view of the amendments made in 1939 the words in question can be read ejusdem generis with Hindu undivided family or company.

The High Court correctly answered question No. 3 in the negative. Accordingly, the appeals fail and are dismissed with costs. There will be one set of hearing fee in the two appeals.

1960. April 14. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by S. K. DAS, J.-These two appeals with special leave have been heard together. They arise out of similar facts and the question of law arising therefrom is the same.
The short facts are these. One Balkrishna Purushottam Purani died on November 11, 1947. He left behind him three widows and two daughters. The three widows were named Indira, Ramluxmi and Prabhuluxmi. These widows as legal heirs inherited the estate of the deceased, which consisted of immovable properties situate in Ahmedabad, shares in Joint Stock Companies, money lying in deposit, and share in a registered firm.

For the assessment year 1951-52, the total income was shown as-

For both years the Income-tax Officer took the status of the assessee as an " association of persons " and on that footing made two assessment orders. There was an appear to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, and two of the points taken before him were(a) that the three widows ought to have been assessed separately and not as an " association of persons ", and (b) that in any event, the income from property ought to have been assessed separately in the hands of the three widows by reason of the provisions in s. 9(3) of the Income-tax Act, 1922. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner rejected point (a) but accepted point (b). Then, there was a further appeal to the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal, Bombay. The Tribunal held that the entire estate of deceased Balkrishna Purushottam Purani was inherited and possessed by the three widows as joint tenants and its income was liable to be assessed in their hands in the status of an association of persons. The Tribunal further held that the Appellate Assistant Commissioner was wrong in holding that the shares of the three widows were definite and determinable and s. 9(3) was applicable. The assessee then moved the Tribunal to refer certain questions of law which arose out of its orders to the High Court of Bombay. The Tribunal referred four such questions, but we are now concerned with only one of them, viz., question No. 3 which was in the following terms:
Two references were made to the High Court in respect of the orders passed for two assessment years and they gave rise to Income-tax References Nos. 52 and 53 of 1955. The leading judgment was given in T. T. It. 52 of 1955. The High Court held that the Tribunal was in error in coming to the conclusion that the three widows could be assessed in the status of an association of persons with regard to the income which they earned as heirs of their deceased husband. Therefore, it answered question No. 3 in the negative. The department represented by the Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay, then applied to this Court and obtained special leave to appeal from the judgment and orders of the High Court of Bombay in the two References. These two appeals have been filed in pursuance of the special leave granted by this Court. The appellant is the Commissioner of Income- tax, Bombay, and the assessee is the respondent. The argument on behalf of the appellant is that the High Court was in error when it said that " what is required before an association of persons can be liable to tax is not that they should receive income but that they should earn or help to earn income by reason of their association, and if the case of the Department stops short at mere receipt of income, then the Department must fail in bringing home the liability to tax of individuals as an association of persons." It is submitted that the High Court did not, in the statement quoted above, lay down the correct test for determining what is an " association of persons "
By the same Amending Act (Act VII of 1939) sub-s. (3) of s. 9 was also added.
Now, s. 3 imposes a tax " in respect of the total income...................... of every individual, Hindu un- divided family, company and local authority, and of every firm and other association of persons or the partners of the firm or members of the association individually." In the absence of any definition as to what constitutes an association of persons, we must construe the words in their plain ordinary meaning and we must also bear in mind that the words occur in a section which imposes a tax on the total income of each one of the units of assessment mentioned therein including an association of persons. The meaning to be assigned to the words must take colour from the context in which they occur.

We have indicated above what is the crucial test in determining an association of persons within the meaning of s. 3, and we are of the view that the test suggested by learned counsel for the appellant are neither conclusive nor determinative of the question before us.
Coming back to the facts found by the Tribunal, there is no finding that the three widows have combined in a joint enterprise to produce income. The only finding is that they have not exercised their right to separate enjoyment, and except for receiving the dividends and interest jointly, it has been found that they have done no act which has helped to produce income in respect of the shares and deposits. On these findings it cannot be held that the three widows had the status of an association of persons within the meaning of s. 3 of the Indian Income Tax Act.
