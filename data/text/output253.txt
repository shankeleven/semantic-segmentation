CIVIL APPPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 11 of 1950.
Appeal from the judgment and decree of the High Court of Bombay (Bhagwati and Dixit JJ.) dated 16th December, 1948, in Second Appeal No. 1226 of 1945 confirming a judg- ment and decree of the District Judge of Dharwar in Appeal No. 123 of 1943. The facts of the case and the arguments of the counsel appear in the judgment.
The first and second defendants are members of the plaintiff's family while the third defendant is the State of Bombay (Province of Bombay at the date of the suit). The only question is whether the suit is barred by section 4 (a) of Bombay Act X of 1876 (Bombay Revenue Juris- diction Act).
The Bombay Government followed a similar course regarding the property in British India. On the 26th of April, 1882, they passed a Resolution embodying the follow- ing decision:
The only question we have to consider is the one of jurisdiction. Section 4 of the Bombay Revenue Jurisdiction Act, 1876 (Bombay Act X of 1876), runs-	Issue

(d) That it be declared that defendant 3 (Government) have no right to change the Resolution No. 8969 of 7th June, 1932, and at any rate during the lifetime of the plaintiff."
It was next argued that if that be the case the claim against Government can be dismissed and the plaintiff can at least be given the reliefs claimed against the other two defendants. These, it was contended, do not relate to land and in any event are not claims against the "Crown".
In my opinion, this is not a suit in which the rights claimed against the other defendants can be divorced from the claim against Government and considered separately. That is evident enough from paragraph 10 of the plaint. In para- graph 9 the power of Government to deprive the plaintiff of the rights he claims is challenged and in paragraph 10 the plaintiff explains that "therefore" the first and second defendants are not entitled to any of the rights and privileges of the Saranjamdar. One of those rights, as we have seen from Rules VII and IX, is to take the revenues of the entire estate in order that he might fulfil his obligation regarding the payment of maintenance to certain members of the family; and if the defendants claim to hold their lands under the orders of Government and the plaintiff insists on retaining Government as a party in order that it may be bound by the decree he wants against the other defendants it is obvious that his claim against these defendants cannot be separated from his claim against the Government.

Joshi, with him) for respondent No. 3 (the State of Bombay.) 1952. January 30. Judgment was delivered by BOSE J. PATANJALI SASTRI C.J. and DAS J. agreed with Bose J. Bose J.--The plaintiff appeals.
As a consequence a division of the property was ef- fected. Malojirao separated himself from his brothers and was allotted seven villages. The other two brothers continued joint and took the remainder. But this was only with respect to property situate in British India. The parties also had property in the State of Kolhapur. That was left undivided.
The position was re-examined by Government in 1891 and its decision was embodied in the following resolution dated the 17th of March, 1891:
In or about the year 1930 a Record of Rights was intro- duced in fourteen of the villages in the Gajendragad Jaha- gir and a dispute arose again between the three branches of the family. The District Deputy Collector, after inspecting the records, found that "the name of the Khatedar Saran- jamdar alone has found place in the village Inam register, in the Saranjam list and the land alienation register,"
2. The Governor-in-Council agrees with the Commis- sioner, Southern Division, that the assignments held by the Bhaubands as potgi holders should be continued to them as at present."
The Bhujangrao mentioned in the Resolution is the plain- tiff who is shown as Bhujangrao III in the genealogical tree.
The defendants were evidently aggrieved by this, for they filed Suit No. 23 of 1934 against the present plaintiff and the Secretary of State/or India in Council praying inter alia "that the properties in that suit, viz., the villages allotted to their shares, were their independent and private properties and in case they were held to be Saranjam proper- ties, they be declared as independent Saranjams, separate and distinct from the one held by the present plaintiff."
This suit was withdrawn with liberty to bring a fresh suit on the same cause of action against the present plain- tiff but not against the Secretary of State for India in Council. According to defendants 1 and 2, this was pursuant to an arrangement between the Government and themselves that Government would issue a fresh Resolution in terms of the earlier Resolution dated the 17th of March, 1891.

(b) That in consequence of his position of a sole Saran- jamdar the plaintiff alone at any rate during his lifetime has the sole right to the rights and privileges appertaining to the post of a sole Saranjamdar, to wit, to be consulted in the appointment of the village officers in all the villages appertaining to the Saranjam estate, but assigned to defendants 1 and 2 for potgi...
(c) Defendants 1 and 2 be restrained from doing any acts or taking any steps in contravention of the aforesaid right of the plaintiff.
The first Court dismissed the plaintiff's claim on the merits holding that Government had the right to amend its Resolution in the way it did.
The lower appellate Court also dismissed the suit on three grounds: (1) that the two previous decisions of 1868 and 1908 operate as res judicata, (2) that the impugned Resolution is intra vires and (3) that section 4 (a) and (d) of the Revenue Jurisdiction Act bars the jurisdiction of the Court.
(a)...claims against the Crown relating to lands... held as Saranjam.... "
Relief (d) in the prayer clause seeks a declaration that Government has no right to change Resolution No. 8969 dated the 7th of June, 1932. That Resolution directly relates to the land because it directs that the Gajendragad Saranjam be resumed and the Collector is directed to take steps to place the Saranjamdar in possession of the villages of the Saran- jam estate etc. It is impossible to contend that this is not a claim relating to lands held as Saranjam.
There are two decisions of the Bombay High Court which have taken this view. Basalingappagouda v. The Secretary of State for India(1) was a Watan case. Government had recog- nised the second defendant as the Watandar. Plaintiff sued Government and the second defendant and sought a declaration and injunction. On being faced with the dilemma that the suit against Government did not lie because of section 4 (a) (3) of the Bombay Revenue Jurisdiction Act of 1876, he asked the Court, as here, to leave the Government out of consider- ation and decree his claim against the second defendant alone. The learned Judges held that that would amount to striking out the main relief sought against both the defend- ants and would entirely (1) 28 Born. L.R. 651.
change the character of the suit and added that "as long as the Secretary of State is a party to the suit, such a decla- ration could not be granted."
In the other case, Basangauda v. The Secretary State(1), Beaumont C.J. and Baker J. took the same view. They said--
They held that the jurisdiction of the courts was oust- ed.
It was next contended, on the strength of a decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council reported in Province of Bombay v. Horrnusji Manekji(2). that the courts have jurisdiction to decide whether Government acted in excess of its powers and that that question must be decided first. In my opinion, this decision does not apply here.

(2) 74 I A. 103 As pointed out by Strangman K.C., on behalf of the plaintiff-respondent, "authorised" must mean "duly autho- rised," and in that particular case the impugned assessment would not be duly authorised if the Government Resolution of 11-4-1990 purporting to treat the agreement relied on by the respondent as cancelled and authorising the levy of the full assessment was ultra vires under section 211 of the Land Revenue Code. Thus, before the exclusion of the Civil Court's jurisdiction under section 4 (b) could come into play, the Court had to determine the issue of ultra vires. Consequently, their Lordships held that that question was outside the scope of the bar. But the position here is different. We are concerned here with section 4 (a) and under that no question about an authorised act of Government arises. The section is general and bars all "claims against the Crown relating to lands...... held as Saranjam." That is to say, even if the Government's act in relation to such lands was ultra vires, a claim impugning the validity of such an act would fall within the scope of the exclusion in clause (a) provided it relates to such land.
There is a difference of opinion in the Bombay High Court as to whether section 4 is attracted if the only relief sought against Government is a declaration. One set of decisions holds that that does not amount to a "claim against Government." Dattatraya Vishwanath v. The Secretary of State for India(1) is typical of that view. On the other hand, Daulatrao v. Government of bombay(2), a case relating to the Gajendragad estate, took the other view. In my opin- ion, the latter view is correct.	Precedent
The following genealogical tree will show the relation- ship between the parties:
Finally, the Resolution Concluded--
In the year 1901 the adopted son Daulatrao II sued Yeshwantrao's son Bhujangrao II for partition. It will be remembered that in the litigation of 1866, which ended in the Bombay High Court's judgment reported in 5 Bom. H.C.R. 161, Malojirao alone separated and the other two brothers continued joint. The litigation of 1901 put an end to that position. High Court's judgment dated the 12th of March, 1908, makes it clear that as Government was not a party to that litigation its rights against either or both of the parties were not affected. But as between the parties inter se they were bound by the previous decision and so the adopted son was entitled to partition and separate posses- sion of such properties as might fall to his share. After this decision was given the two partitioned the property between themselves amicably.
In the meanwhile, on the 5th of May, 1898, a set of Rules framed under Schedule B, Rule 10, of the Bombay Rent Free Estates Act of 1852 were drawn up and published in the Bombay Gazette. These Rules were republished, probably with some modification, in the Gazette of 8th July, 1901. The portions applicable here were as follows:-
After the District Deputy Collector's orders were passed on the 20th of May, 1930, Daulatrao II died on the 8th of May, 1931, and the matter was again taken up by Government. This time it passed the following Resolution on the 7th of June, 1932. The Resolution was headed, "Resumption and regrant of the Gajendragad Saranjam standing at No. 91 of the Saranjam List." It reads--
This was done. On the 25th of February, 1936, Government passed the following Resolution :--
The present suit is an attack on the action of Govern- ment in passing this Resolution. The first and second defendants are the present representatives of the other branches of the family and the third defendant is the Prov- ince of Bombay (now the State of Bombay). The plaint states-
The next question is whether, assuming that to be the case, it is also one "relating to lands held as Saranjam." So far as the reliefs sought against Government are concerned, that is clearly the case. Paragraph 9 of the plaint challenges Government's jurisdiction to deprive the plaintiff of the full benefit of all rights and privileges appertaining to the holder of a Saranjam. These rights cannot exist apart from the lands which form part of the Saranjam estate and the implication of the prayer is that Government has, for example, no right to resume the Saranjam either under Rule V on the death of the last Saran- jamdar or under Rule IX during his lifetime. It is to be observed that a resumption under Rule IX can only be of the land because the rule directs that when the Saranjam is resumed Government itself shall make provisions for the maintenance of those entitled to it "out of the revenues of the Saranjam so resumed." These revenues can only come out of the land.
Their Lordships were dealing with a case falling under section 4 (b) of the Bombay Revenue Jurisdiction Act of 1876. That provides that--	Section
2. The Governor-in-Council further directs that the aforesaid shares shall in no case be capable of sub-division and shall not in any way be alienated or encum- bered except in accordance with the rules and orders re- ferred to above..."
The reliefs prayed for are--
In second appeal the High Court only considered the question of jurisdiction and, agreeing with the lower appel- late Court on the point, dismissed the appeal but it granted the plaintiff leave to appeal to this Court.
Subject to the exceptions hereinafter appearing, no Civil Court shall exercise jurisdiction as to-
ment of land revenue authorised by the Provincial Govern- ment."
In my opinion, the decision of the High Court was right and I would dismiss the appeal with costs. PATANJALI SASTRI C.J.--I agree.

CIVIL APPPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 11 of 1950.
Appeal from the judgment and decree of the High Court of Bombay (Bhagwati and Dixit JJ.) dated 16th December, 1948, in Second Appeal No. 1226 of 1945 confirming a judg- ment and decree of the District Judge of Dharwar in Appeal No. 123 of 1943.

The suit relates to a Saranjam estate in the State of Bombay. The plaintiff claims to be the sole Saranjamdar and seeks certain declarations and other reliefs appropriate to such a claim.
The first and second defendants are members of the plaintiff's family while the third defendant is the State of Bombay (Province of Bombay at the date of the suit). The only question is whether the suit is barred by section 4 (a) of Bombay Act X of 1876 (Bombay Revenue Juris- diction Act).
The following genealogical tree will show the relation- ship between the parties:
On the death of the British Grantee (Bhujangrao Appa- saheb) he was succeeded by his son Daulatrao I who died on the 24th of July, 1864. This Daulatrao I left three sons, Bhujangrao I, Yeshwantrao and Malojirao.
In the year 1866 Bhujangrao I and his brother Yesh- wantrao alias Annasaheb sued Malojirao for possession of this Saranjam. A question of impartibility was raised but the Bombay High Court declared that the property in British India was partible. They further declared that Bhujangrao I was the head of the family and as such was entitled to a special assignment which was not to exceed a quarter share, for the expenses and duties which might devolve on him by virtue of his position, and that after this had been set aside each of the three brothers was entitled to an equal one-third Share in the landed property in India. This judgment is reported in 5 Bom. H.C.R. 161. The duties enumerated at page 170 included the "keeping up of armed retainers for the fort of Gajendragad, and for the improvement of that vil- lage, which was the chief seat of this branch of the Ghor- pade family, and also to enable him to distribute on ceremo- nial occasions the customary presents to the junior members of the family." The judgment is dated the 12th of October, 1868.
As a consequence a division of the property was ef- fected. Malojirao separated himself from his brothers and was allotted seven villages. The other two brothers continued joint and took the remainder. But this was only with respect to property situate in British India. The parties also had property in the State of Kolhapur. That was left undivided.
Bhujangrao I died in 1881 and his younger brother Yesh- wantrao (alias Annasaheb) claimed to succeed as the sole heir. The Political Department of the Government of India refused to recognise this claim and permitted Bhujangrao I's widow Krishnabai to adopt a a boy from the family and recog- nised him as the heir in respect of that portion of the estate which lay within the Principality of Kolhapur. This was on the 3rd of February, 1882.
The Bombay Government followed a similar course regarding the property in British India. On the 26th of April, 1882, they passed a Resolution embodying the follow- ing decision:
Finally, the Resolution Concluded--
``The two brothers will hold their respective shares as their private property in virtue of the decree of the High Court and the Jahagir will henceforth be restricted to the portion awarded by the High Court to Bhujangrao which the adopted son will now inherit. It should however be clearly understood that the decision of the High Court is not to be held as a precedent and that no partition of the Jahagir Estate to be continued to the adopted son will ever be allowed."
This position was emphasised by Government in the same year on the 22nd August, 1882. Krishnabai, who had been allowed by Government to adopt Daulatrao II, asked that her husband's one-third share in the estate be also treated as private property in the same way as the shares of the other two brothers. This prayer was refused and Government stat- ed:
The position was re-examined by Government in 1891 and its decision was embodied in the following resolution dated the 17th of March, 1891:
In the year 1901 the adopted son Daulatrao II sued Yeshwantrao's son Bhujangrao II for partition. It will be remembered that in the litigation of 1866, which ended in the Bombay High Court's judgment reported in 5 Bom. H.C.R. 161, Malojirao alone separated and the other two brothers continued joint. The litigation of 1901 put an end to that position. High Court's judgment dated the 12th of March, 1908, makes it clear that as Government was not a party to that litigation its rights against either or both of the parties were not affected. But as between the parties inter se they were bound by the previous decision and so the adopted son was entitled to partition and separate posses- sion of such properties as might fall to his share. After this decision was given the two partitioned the property between themselves amicably.
In or about the year 1930 a Record of Rights was intro- duced in fourteen of the villages in the Gajendragad Jaha- gir and a dispute arose again between the three branches of the family. The District Deputy Collector, after inspecting the records, found that "the name of the Khatedar Saran- jamdar alone has found place in the village Inam register, in the Saranjam list and the land alienation register,"
After due consideration he thought that the interest of Government and the Saranjamdar would be sufficiently safeguarded by allowing the same position to continue. He ordered the entries to be made accordingly. The order also discloses that the matter had been referred to the Legal Remembrancer to the Bombay Government.
In the meanwhile, on the 5th of May, 1898, a set of Rules framed under Schedule B, Rule 10, of the Bombay Rent Free Estates Act of 1852 were drawn up and published in the Bombay Gazette. These Rules were republished, probably with some modification, in the Gazette of 8th July, 1901. The portions applicable here were as follows:-
After the District Deputy Collector's orders were passed on the 20th of May, 1930, Daulatrao II died on the 8th of May, 1931, and the matter was again taken up by Government. This time it passed the following Resolution on the 7th of June, 1932. The Resolution was headed, "Resumption and regrant of the Gajendragad Saranjam standing at No. 91 of the Saranjam List." It reads--
2. The Governor-in-Council agrees with the Commis- sioner, Southern Division, that the assignments held by the Bhaubands as potgi holders should be continued to them as at present."
The Bhujangrao mentioned in the Resolution is the plain- tiff who is shown as Bhujangrao III in the genealogical tree.
The defendants were evidently aggrieved by this, for they filed Suit No. 23 of 1934 against the present plaintiff and the Secretary of State/or India in Council praying inter alia "that the properties in that suit, viz., the villages allotted to their shares, were their independent and private properties and in case they were held to be Saranjam proper- ties, they be declared as independent Saranjams, separate and distinct from the one held by the present plaintiff."
This suit was withdrawn with liberty to bring a fresh suit on the same cause of action against the present plain- tiff but not against the Secretary of State for India in Council. According to defendants 1 and 2, this was pursuant to an arrangement between the Government and themselves that Government would issue a fresh Resolution in terms of the earlier Resolution dated the 17th of March, 1891.
This was done. On the 25th of February, 1936, Government passed the following Resolution :--

2. The Governor-in-Council further directs that the aforesaid shares shall in no case be capable of sub-division and shall not in any way be alienated or encum- bered except in accordance with the rules and orders re- ferred to above..."
The present suit is an attack on the action of Govern- ment in passing this Resolution. The first and second defendants are the present representatives of the other branches of the family and the third defendant is the Prov- ince of Bombay (now the State of Bombay). The plaint states-
The reliefs prayed for are--
lution No. 8969 of 7th June, 1932, under which plaintiff is entitled to be recognised as the sole Saranjamdar in the Revenue Records, and that the assignments held by defendants 1 and 2 are held by them as mere potgi holders.
(b) That in consequence of his position of a sole Saran- jamdar the plaintiff alone at any rate during his lifetime has the sole right to the rights and privileges appertaining to the post of a sole Saranjamdar, to wit, to be consulted in the appointment of the village officers in all the villages appertaining to the Saranjam estate, but assigned to defendants 1 and 2 for potgi...
(c) Defendants 1 and 2 be restrained from doing any acts or taking any steps in contravention of the aforesaid right of the plaintiff.
(d) That it be declared that defendant 3 (Government) have no right to change the Resolution No. 8969 of 7th June, 1932, and at any rate during the lifetime of the plaintiff."
The first Court dismissed the plaintiff's claim on the merits holding that Government had the right to amend its Resolution in the way it did.
The lower appellate Court also dismissed the suit on three grounds: (1) that the two previous decisions of 1868 and 1908 operate as res judicata, (2) that the impugned Resolution is intra vires and (3) that section 4 (a) and (d) of the Revenue Jurisdiction Act bars the jurisdiction of the Court.
In second appeal the High Court only considered the question of jurisdiction and, agreeing with the lower appel- late Court on the point, dismissed the appeal but it granted the plaintiff leave to appeal to this Court.
The only question we have to consider is the one of jurisdiction. Section 4 of the Bombay Revenue Jurisdiction Act, 1876 (Bombay Act X of 1876), runs-
Subject to the exceptions hereinafter appearing, no Civil Court shall exercise jurisdiction as to-
(a)...claims against the Crown relating to lands... held as Saranjam.... "
The next question is whether, assuming that to be the case, it is also one "relating to lands held as Saranjam." So far as the reliefs sought against Government are concerned, that is clearly the case. Paragraph 9 of the plaint challenges Government's jurisdiction to deprive the plaintiff of the full benefit of all rights and privileges appertaining to the holder of a Saranjam. These rights cannot exist apart from the lands which form part of the Saranjam estate and the implication of the prayer is that Government has, for example, no right to resume the Saranjam either under Rule V on the death of the last Saran- jamdar or under Rule IX during his lifetime. It is to be observed that a resumption under Rule IX can only be of the land because the rule directs that when the Saranjam is resumed Government itself shall make provisions for the maintenance of those entitled to it "out of the revenues of the Saranjam so resumed." These revenues can only come out of the land.
Relief (d) in the prayer clause seeks a declaration that Government has no right to change Resolution No. 8969 dated the 7th of June, 1932. That Resolution directly relates to the land because it directs that the Gajendragad Saranjam be resumed and the Collector is directed to take steps to place the Saranjamdar in possession of the villages of the Saran- jam estate etc. It is impossible to contend that this is not a claim relating to lands held as Saranjam.
It was next argued that if that be the case the claim against Government can be dismissed and the plaintiff can at least be given the reliefs claimed against the other two defendants. These, it was contended, do not relate to land and in any event are not claims against the "Crown".
In my opinion, this is not a suit in which the rights claimed against the other defendants can be divorced from the claim against Government and considered separately. That is evident enough from paragraph 10 of the plaint. In para- graph 9 the power of Government to deprive the plaintiff of the rights he claims is challenged and in paragraph 10 the plaintiff explains that "therefore" the first and second defendants are not entitled to any of the rights and privileges of the Saranjamdar. One of those rights, as we have seen from Rules VII and IX, is to take the revenues of the entire estate in order that he might fulfil his obligation regarding the payment of maintenance to certain members of the family; and if the defendants claim to hold their lands under the orders of Government and the plaintiff insists on retaining Government as a party in order that it may be bound by the decree he wants against the other defendants it is obvious that his claim against these defendants cannot be separated from his claim against the Government.
In any event, if the claim against Government is to be ignored it can only be on the basis that its orders cannot be challenged and if the orders stand it is evident that the plaintiff can have no hope of success because both sides hold their respective properties on the basis of those orders.
There are two decisions of the Bombay High Court which have taken this view. Basalingappagouda v. The Secretary of State for India(1) was a Watan case. Government had recog- nised the second defendant as the Watandar. Plaintiff sued Government and the second defendant and sought a declaration and injunction. On being faced with the dilemma that the suit against Government did not lie because of section 4 (a) (3) of the Bombay Revenue Jurisdiction Act of 1876, he asked the Court, as here, to leave the Government out of consider- ation and decree his claim against the second defendant alone.
