CIVIL APPELLATE, JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 133 of 1955.

N. C. Chatterji, M. S. K. Sastri and Sardar Bahadur, for the appellant.
Porus A. Mehta, T. V. R. Tatachari and T. M. Sen, for the respondent.
Before us, the appellant pressed both the grounds which were raised by him in his application under Art. 226. On the question whether by reason of the Andhra Civil Services Rules coming into operation with effect from October 1, 1953, the High Court had ceased to have jurisdiction to proceed with the matter, it is necessary first to refer to the relevant Rules. Rule 4 of the Madras Civil Services (Disciplinary Proceedings Tribunal) Rules, 1948, which was the Rule in force when the enquiry against the appellant was started, runs as follows:	Issue
1956. November 29. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMA AYYAR J.-The appellant was recruited to the Madras Provincial Judicial Service as District Munsif in 1935. In 1949 he was promoted to the office of Subordinate Judge, and on June 19, 1950, he was posted as Subordinate Judge of Masulipatnam, Krishna District. Among the suits which he tried were O.S. No. 95 of 1946 and O.S. No. 24 of 1949, which were connected, and on July 27, 1950, arguments were heard therein, and judgment reserved. On August 22, 1950, while judgment was still pending, Lingam Sitarama Rao, who was the fifth defendant in both the suits, filed an application in the High Court of Madras for transferring them to some other court on the ground that the appellant was attempting through his brother to obtain bribe from the parties, and on this application, the High Court passed an order on the same date, staying the delivery of judgment. The suits themselves were eventually transferred to the court of the Subordinate Judge of Gudivada, and the appellant was also transferred on September 16, 1950, to the Subordinate Court of Amalapuram in East Godavari District. Thereafter, the High Court started investigation into the allegations made in the affidavit in the stay petition, and as a result of the enquiries and reports received, the following charge was framed against the appellant on April 2, 1953:
These reports were considered at a meeting of the Judges of the Madras High Court on January 25,1954, and they decided that "the proper punishment to be awarded to the officer as regards the two counts are (1) regarding the first charge of bribery, dismissal from service and (2) regarding the second charge of various delinquencies, such as delaying judgments, etc., removal from service." Then they passed an order on January 28, 1954, placing the appellant on suspension until further orders, and the same was communicated to him on January 30, 1954.	Facts
The appellant filed his written statement in answer to the charge on June 22, 1953.
One of the Judges of the High Court of Madras, Balakrishna Ayyar, J., was deputed to enquire into these charges, and after making an elaborate enquiry in which several witnesses including the appellant were examined, he sent a report on October 20, 1953, that the charge of corruption was made out, and he concluded as follows:	PetArg
You are hereby required within 15 days of the receipt by you of this proceeding (i) to submit a written statement of your defence and to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against you in respect of the above charge, and (ii) to state whether you desire an oral enquiry to be held or only to be heard in person."	RespArg
Meantime, complaints had also been received by the High Court that the appellant had committed serious irregularities in the discharge of his official duties in the Sub-Court, Amalapuram, such as that he had delayed delivering judgments in the suits and appeals for an unreasonable time, that he had made false returns to the District Court, and that to cover his defaults, he had altered the records of the court so as to be consistent with those returns. Charges were framed with reference to these irregularities on January 15,1953, and further charges relating to the same matter were framed on May 6, 1953, to all of which he filed his explanation on June 22, 1953.
On April 28, 1954, the appellant filed in the High Court of Madras a petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution, for a writ quashing the order of suspension dated January 28, 1954, on the grounds, firstly, that under the Andhra Civil Services (Disciplinary Proceedings Tribunal) Rules, 1953, which had been published by the Andhra Government on October 22, 1953, with effect from October 1, 1953, enquiry into the conduct of Government servants on a monthly salary of Rs. 150 and above could be held only by a Tribunal to which the Government might refer the same, and that, therefore, the proceedings of the High Court of Madras after October 1, 1953, culminating in the order of suspension dated January 28, 1954, were without jurisdiction, and secondly, that the order in question was void, as it was in contravention of Art. 311 of the Constitution. It must be mentioned that the State of Andhra had come into existence on October 1, 1953, but that the High Court of Madras continued to have jurisdiction over the Andhra State until July, 1954, when a separate High Court was established therefor. The writ petition which was pending in the High Court of Madras was then transferred to the Andhra High Court. At the hearing, the only contention that would appear to have been pressed by the appellant was that by reason of the Andhra Civil Services (Disciplinary Proceedings Tribunal) Rules, 1953, coming into force on October 1, 1953, it was only a Tribunal as provided in Rule 4 (1) (a) of those Rules that could enquire into the charges, and that the proceedings in the High Court of Madras subsequent thereto were without jurisdiction. In rejecting this contention, the learned Judge.% observed that though Rule 4 of the Andhra Civil Services Rules differed in some respects from the corresponding Rule of the Madras Civil Services Rules, 1948, the differences were of an unsubstantial character, and were due more to inexpert" drafting than to any deliberate intention to effect a change in the Madras Rules. They further held that if the Rule in question was intended to affect the jurisdiction of the High Court to hold an enquiry into the conduct of a Subordinate judicial officer, it would be in contravention of Arts. 227 and 235 of the Constitution, which vested in the High Court the control and: superintendence of all the Courts in the State. In the result, they dismissed the application. The matter now comes before this Court in appeal under Art. 136 of the Constitution.	Precedent

1956. November 29. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMA AYYAR J.-The appellant was recruited to the Madras Provincial Judicial Service as District Munsif in 1935. In 1949 he was promoted to the office of Subordinate Judge, and on June 19, 1950, he was posted as Subordinate Judge of Masulipatnam, Krishna District. Among the suits which he tried were O.S.

The suits themselves were eventually transferred to the court of the Subordinate Judge of Gudivada, and the appellant was also transferred on September 16, 1950, to the Subordinate Court of Amalapuram in East Godavari District. Thereafter, the High Court started investigation into the allegations made in the affidavit in the stay petition, and as a result of the enquiries and reports received, the following charge was framed against the appellant on April 2, 1953:
You are hereby required within 15 days of the receipt by you of this proceeding (i) to submit a written statement of your defence and to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against you in respect of the above charge, and (ii) to state whether you desire an oral enquiry to be held or only to be heard in person."
The appellant filed his written statement in answer to the charge on June 22, 1953.
Meantime, complaints had also been received by the High Court that the appellant had committed serious irregularities in the discharge of his official duties in the Sub-Court, Amalapuram, such as that he had delayed delivering judgments in the suits and appeals for an unreasonable time, that he had made false returns to the District Court, and that to cover his defaults, he had altered the records of the court so as to be consistent with those returns. Charges were framed with reference to these irregularities on January 15,1953, and further charges relating to the same matter were framed on May 6, 1953, to all of which he filed his explanation on June 22, 1953.
One of the Judges of the High Court of Madras, Balakrishna Ayyar, J., was deputed to enquire into these charges, and after making an elaborate enquiry in which several witnesses including the appellant were examined, he sent a report on October 20, 1953, that the charge of corruption was made out, and he concluded as follows:
With reference to the charges of irregularities, etc., Balakrishna Ayyar J. submitted his report on November 10, 1953, in which also he found that the charges were all substantially established, and he concluded as follows:
These reports were considered at a meeting of the Judges of the Madras High Court on January 25,1954, and they decided that "the proper punishment to be awarded to the officer as regards the two counts are (1) regarding the first charge of bribery, dismissal from service and (2) regarding the second charge of various delinquencies, such as delaying judgments, etc., removal from service." Then they passed an order on January 28, 1954, placing the appellant on suspension until further orders, and the same was communicated to him on January 30, 1954.
On April 28, 1954, the appellant filed in the High Court of Madras a petition under Art. 226 of the Constitution, for a writ quashing the order of suspension dated January 28, 1954, on the grounds, firstly, that under the Andhra Civil Services (Disciplinary Proceedings Tribunal) Rules, 1953, which had been published by the Andhra Government on October 22, 1953, with effect from October 1, 1953, enquiry into the conduct of Government servants on a monthly salary of Rs. 150 and above could be held only by a Tribunal to which the Government might refer the same, and that, therefore, the proceedings of the High Court of Madras after October 1, 1953, culminating in the order of suspension dated January 28, 1954, were without jurisdiction, and secondly, that the order in question was void, as it was in contravention of Art. 311 of the Constitution. It must be mentioned that the State of Andhra had come into existence on October 1, 1953, but that the High Court of Madras continued to have jurisdiction over the Andhra State until July, 1954, when a separate High Court was established therefor. The writ petition which was pending in the High Court of Madras was then transferred to the Andhra High Court. At the hearing, the only contention that would appear to have been pressed by the appellant was that by reason of the Andhra Civil Services (Disciplinary Proceedings Tribunal) Rules, 1953, coming into force on October 1, 1953, it was only a Tribunal as provided in Rule 4 (1) (a) of those Rules that could enquire into the charges, and that the proceedings in the High Court of Madras subsequent thereto were without jurisdiction. In rejecting this contention, the learned Judge.% observed that though Rule 4 of the Andhra Civil Services Rules differed in some respects from the corresponding Rule of the Madras Civil Services Rules, 1948, the differences were of an unsubstantial character, and were due more to inexpert" drafting than to any deliberate intention to effect a change in the Madras Rules. They further held that if the Rule in question was intended to affect the jurisdiction of the High Court to hold an enquiry into the conduct of a Subordinate judicial officer, it would be in contravention of Arts. 227 and 235 of the Constitution, which vested in the High Court the control and: superintendence of all the Courts in the State. In the result, they dismissed the application. The matter now comes before this Court in appeal under Art. 136 of the Constitution.
