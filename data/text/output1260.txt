Topanmal Chhotamal vs Kundomal Gangaram And Ors. on 8 September, 1959	Case Title
1. This appeal by special leave is against the judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad dated February 10, 1952. The facts lie in a small compass, and briefly stated they are as follows:	Issue
Rule 6 : "Where persons are sued as partners in the name of their firm, they shall appear individually in their own names, but all subsequent proceedings shall, nevertheless, continue in the name of the firm."
4. At the worst the decree can be said to be ambiguous. In such a case it is the duty of the executing Court to construe the decree. For the purpose of interpreting a decree, when its terms are ambiguous, the Court would certainly be entitled to look Into the pleadings and the judgment: see Manakchand v. Manoharlal, . In the plaint in the Agra suit, Suit No. 205 of 1949, not only relief was asked for against the firm, but also a personal decree was claimed against defendants 2 to 6. The said defendants inter alia raised the plea that a personal decree could not be passed against them because they were not made parties to the suit filed in the Chief Court, Sind, and were not personally served therein. The learned Civil Judge, Agra, in accepting the plea made the following observation:
After citing the relevant passage from the decision of the Madras High Court in Sahib Thambi Marakayar v. Hamid Marakayar, ILR 36 Mad. 414, the learned Civil Judge concluded thus:	Precedent
2a. The learned Attorney-General, appearing for the appellant, contended that on a true construction of the decree in Suit No. 205 of 1949, on the file of the Court of Civil Judge, Agra, it must be held that the decree was made against the firm without any limitations, and, if so construed the appellant would be entitled to execute the decree under Order XXI, Rule 50, Civil Procedure Code, against the personal assets of the partners of the firm, respondents 2 to 6. To appreciate this contention it would be convenient to read, at this stage, the relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure.
Order XXI, Rule 50: "(1) Where a decree has been passed against a firm, execution may be granted--
The gist of the said provisions may be stated thus: A decree against a firm can be executed (i) against the property of the partnership, (ii) against any person who has appeared in the suit individually in his own name and has been served with a notice under Rule 6 or 7 of Order XXX of C. P. C., (iii) against a person who has admitted on the pleadings that he is or has been adjudged a partner, or (iv) against any person who has been served with notice individually as a partner but has failed to appear. The decree against the firm can be executed against the personal property of such persons.
3. So stated the legal position is unexceptional and indeed it has not been disputed by the learned counsel for the respondents, but what is contended is that the decree sought to be executed expressly excluded personal liability of the partners and, therefore, notwithstanding the provisions of Order XXI, Rule 50, the executing Court is precluded from going behind the decree. The decree consisted of two parts. The first part of the decree reads:
If those words exhausted the decree, the provisions of Order XXI, Rule 50, were automatically attracted, for the decree was against the firm. But the decree continued to state:
This part of the decree would be redundant if it was intended only, as the learned Attorney-General contended, to convey nothing more than the idea that the decree was against the assets of the firm, for that was really the effect of the first part of the decree. A decree against a firm without any further directions can be executed, subject to the provisions of Order XXI, Rule 50, C. P. C., against the properties of the firm in the hands of its partners. To avoid tautology, it is therefore necessary to read the decree as a whole to fit in the two parts in an integrated scheme. So construed, the reasonable interpretation would be that the first part gave a decree against the firm, and the second part confined its operation to the assets of the firm in the hands of its partners.	Section
6. The conclusion arrived at by the learned Judges of the High Court is correct. The appeal fails and is dismissed with costs. The appellant is directed to pay the court, fee payable by him to the State.	Conclusion
1. This appeal by special leave is against the judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad dated February 10, 1952. The facts lie in a small compass, and briefly stated they are as follows:
2a. The learned Attorney-General, appearing for the appellant, contended that on a true construction of the decree in Suit No. 205 of 1949, on the file of the Court of Civil Judge, Agra, it must be held that the decree was made against the firm without any limitations, and, if so construed the appellant would be entitled to execute the decree under Order XXI, Rule 50, Civil Procedure Code, against the personal assets of the partners of the firm, respondents 2 to 6. To appreciate this contention it would be convenient to read, at this stage, the relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure.
Order XXI, Rule 50: "(1) Where a decree has been passed against a firm, execution may be granted--
Rule 6 : "Where persons are sued as partners in the name of their firm, they shall appear individually in their own names, but all subsequent proceedings shall, nevertheless, continue in the name of the firm."
The gist of the said provisions may be stated thus: A decree against a firm can be executed (i) against the property of the partnership, (ii) against any person who has appeared in the suit individually in his own name and has been served with a notice under Rule 6 or 7 of Order XXX of C. P. C., (iii) against a person who has admitted on the pleadings that he is or has been adjudged a partner, or (iv) against any person who has been served with notice individually as a partner but has failed to appear. The decree against the firm can be executed against the personal property of such persons.
3. So stated the legal position is unexceptional and indeed it has not been disputed by the learned counsel for the respondents, but what is contended is that the decree sought to be executed expressly excluded personal liability of the partners and, therefore, notwithstanding the provisions of Order XXI, Rule 50, the executing Court is precluded from going behind the decree. The decree consisted of two parts. The first part of the decree reads:
If those words exhausted the decree, the provisions of Order XXI, Rule 50, were automatically attracted, for the decree was against the firm. But the decree continued to state:
This part of the decree would be redundant if it was intended only, as the learned Attorney-General contended, to convey nothing more than the idea that the decree was against the assets of the firm, for that was really the effect of the first part of the decree. A decree against a firm without any further directions can be executed, subject to the provisions of Order XXI, Rule 50, C. P. C., against the properties of the firm in the hands of its partners. To avoid tautology, it is therefore necessary to read the decree as a whole to fit in the two parts in an integrated scheme. So construed, the reasonable interpretation would be that the first part gave a decree against the firm, and the second part confined its operation to the assets of the firm in the hands of its partners.
4. At the worst the decree can be said to be ambiguous. In such a case it is the duty of the executing Court to construe the decree. For the purpose of interpreting a decree, when its terms are ambiguous, the Court would certainly be entitled to look Into the pleadings and the judgment: see Manakchand v. Manoharlal, . In the plaint in the Agra suit, Suit No. 205 of 1949, not only relief was asked for against the firm, but also a personal decree was claimed against defendants 2 to 6. The said defendants inter alia raised the plea that a personal decree could not be passed against them because they were not made parties to the suit filed in the Chief Court, Sind, and were not personally served therein. The learned Civil Judge, Agra, in accepting the plea made the following observation:
After citing the relevant passage from the decision of the Madras High Court in Sahib Thambi Marakayar v. Hamid Marakayar, ILR 36 Mad. 414, the learned Civil Judge concluded thus:
Then followed the decretal order. It is manifest from the pleadings and the judgment of the learned Civil Judge that when a personal decree was sought against respondents 2 to 6 on the same grounds that would have been open to the appellant for executing the decree against them under Order XXI, Rule 50, C. P. C., the learned Judge, for specific reasons mentioned by him, refused to give the appellant the said relief and expressly confined it to the assets of the firm in the hands of the partners.
5. The question is whether in such circumstances an executing Court can go behind the decree & give the relief to the appellant which was expressly denied to him in the suit. The question so posed can only have one answer. It is a well-settled principle that a Court executing a decree cannot go behind the decree: it must take the decree as it stands, for the decree is binding and conclusive between the parties to the suit. If the contention of the appellant were to be accepted, it would contravene the said principle; for, while the decree as construed by us, has directed that it should not be executed against the personal properties of the partners, the executing Court would be directing execution against the said partners. While the decree excluded persona] liability, the executing Court would be imposing the same. This cannot obviously be done.
6. The conclusion arrived at by the learned Judges of the High Court is correct. The appeal fails and is dismissed with costs. The appellant is directed to pay the court, fee payable by him to the State.	Total Judgement
