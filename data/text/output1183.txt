SUBBA RAO, J.-This appeal by Special Leave against the judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Madras raises the question of interpretation of S. 43A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 (IV of 1939), as amended by the Motor Vehicles (Madras Amendment) Act, 1948 (Mad. XX of 1948), hereinafter referred to as the Act. On February 19, 1955, the Regional Transport Authority, Tanjore, Madras State, the second respondent herein, called for applications under s. 57(2) of the Act for grant of a stage carriage permit on the Saliamangalam Kodavasal route. The appellant and the fourth respondent, K. M. Shanmugam, Proprietor, K. M. S. Transport, Ammapet, Tanjore District, along with others, applied for the grant of the said permit. The Regional Transport Authority at its meeting held on April 19, 1955, after hearing the representations of the applicants, granted the permit to the appellant. The fourth respondent and two others preferred appeals against the said order to the Central Road Traffic Board, Madras, the third respondent herein. The Central Road Traffic, Board by its order dated June 25, 1955, set aside the order of the Regional Transport Authority and granted the permit to the fourth respondent. The appellant preferred a Revision Petition against that order to the first respondent, the State of Madras, but the first respondent rejected the petition by its order dated October 14, 1955. Thereafter, the appellant filed a Writ Petition (No. 852 of 1955) in the High Court of Madras under Art. 226 of the Constitution to quash the orders of the Central Road Traffic Board and the State of Madras. Rajagopalan, J., of the said High Court by his order dated May 1, 1956, quashed the order of the Government and directed the State Transport Appellate Tribunal which had been constituted in place of the Central Road Traffic Board to dispose of the appeal in accordance with law. Against the judgment of the learned Judge, the fourth respondent preferred an appeal under the Letters Patent and the Appellate Bench of that High Court, consisting of Rajamannar, C. J., and Ramaswami, J., set aside the order of RajagopaIan, J., and restored the order of the Central Road Traffic Board. The appellant with special leave filed the present appeal against that judgment of the High Court.
Mr. Pathak, appearing for the appellant, raised before us the following two points: (i) The appeal filed by the fourth respondent against the order of the Regional Transport Authority to the Central Road Traffic Board was barred by limitation and the Board acted illegally in disposing of the appeal without deciding the question of limitation; and (ii) the appellant had the fundamental right to carry on the business of transport subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by law as on the date he applied for a permit or at any rate when the Regional Transport Authority issued the permit to him, and that the Central Road Traffic Board committed an error, evident on the face of the record, in disposing of the appeal in accordance with the new restrictions imposed by law made pending the appeal before it. Stated as a legal proposition, the contention is that the appellant had acquired a vested right to carry on the business of transport and that the same could not be defeated by a subsequent law made pending the appeal, which was only prospective in character.
The first argument need not detain us, for the learned Counsel, in view of the finding of the High Court that as a matter of fact the appeal to the Central Road Traffic Board was not barred, fairly did not press it before us. This leaves us with the second and the only argument in the case. To appreciate the contention it is necessary to set out some more relevant facts: On March 28, 1953, the Government made an order, G. O. Ms. No. 1037 Home, purporting to be under s. 43A of the Act. The material part of that order reads:
On November 15, 1954, in supersession of paragraph 2 of the above order, the Government issued an order, G. O. Ms. No. 3353 Home, to the following effect:
The Government also directs that in order to facilitate the amalgamation of existing small units into viable units transfer of permits shall be allowed liberally." On June 15, 1955, the Government issued another order, G. O. Ms. No. 1689 Home, whereby the Central Road Traffic Board was informed that pending further orders of Government after re-examination of the question of formation of viable units of stage carriages, the orders in para. (2) of G. O. Ms. No. 1037 Home dated 28th March, 1953, would be in force. The effect of this order was that the first order was restored pending final orders.
When the Regional Transport Authority issued the permit in favour of the appellant, G. O. Ms. No. 3353 Home dated 15th November, 1954, was in force, and when the Central Road Traffic Board made the order giving the permit to the fourth respondent, G. O. Ms. No. 1689 Home dated 15th June, 1955, was in operation. Apart from other considerations, the Regional Transport Authority relied upon the former G. O. in preferring the appellant to other applicants, while the Central Road Traffic Board referred to G. O. Ms. No. 1037 Home dated 28th March, 1953, which was restored by the later G. O. in preferring the fourth respondent to the appellant. We shall give further details of the orders of the Regional Transport Authority and the Appellate Tribunal in the context of another argument, but, for the present, the aforesaid facts would suffice.	Facts
1959. February 18. The judgment of Imam and Subba Rao, JJ., was delivered by Subba Rao, J. Sarkar, J., delivered a separate judgment.

(ii) directions. Whenever it intended to affect the rights of parties, it used the word " rules ", but in this section it designedly used the words appropriate to the control of administrative machinery. The words " directions and order " are defined in one of the Law Lexicons thus: " Direction contains most of instruction in it; order most of authority. Directions should be followed; orders obeyed. It is necessary to direct those who are unable to act for themselves; it is necessary to order those whose business it is to execute the orders. " The said meaning of the words is more appropriate to administrative control rather than to rules of law affecting rights of parties. Further, the declaration in the section that the orders and the directions under the section shall be binding on the authorities concerned is indicative of the fact that they are not laws, for if they are laws, no such declaration is necessary. What is more, they need not even be published and may, if the Government so desires, take the form of secret communication to the authorities concerned. Nor is there any basis for the argument that as the directions are issued under a statutory power, they are " laws ". The source of the power does not affect the character of the things done in exercise of that power. Whether it is a law or an administrative direction depends upon the character or nature of the orders or directions authorized to be issued in exercise of the power conferred. That should be determined on other considerations adverted to by us already. Our view is in accord with that expressed by a Division Bench of the Madras High Court in C. S. S. Motor Service, Tenkasi v. The State of Madras (1). There the constitutional validity of ss. 42, 43A, 47, 48 and 64A of the Act was questioned. In dealing with s. 43A, Venkatarama Ayyar, J., who delivered the judgment of the Court, observed at p. 335 thus (1) I.L.R. 1953 Mad. 304, 330, 334.
From the aforesaid observations, it is manifest that the learned Judge construed s. 43A as conferring a power on the State Government to issue directions of an administrative character. If the construction was otherwise, the learned Judge would have held that the section was constitutionally bad as he had held in regard to other sections. The High Court of Andhra Pradesh in Gopalakrishna Motor Transport Co. Ltd. v. Secretary, Regional Transport Authority, Krishna District, Vijayawada (2) had also considered the scope of the provisions of s. 43A. There, the State Government issued an order under s. 43A of the Act prescribing the manner of checking a bus for over-
(1) (1948) 1 M.L.J. 85.
loading. The procedure prescribed was not followed by the Regional Transport Authority, which was empowered to suspend the permit on the ground of overloading under s. 60 of the Act. One of the contentions raised was that as the mandatory direction given by s the State Government under s. 43A was not followed, the Regional Transport Authority in exercising its powers under s. 60 should have held that there was no over-loading. In rejecting this plea, the High Court observed at p. 885 thus:
In the present case, the learned Chief Justice, who was a party to the decision in C. S. S. Motor Service v. The State of Madras (1), presumably on the basis of that judgment observed thus:
The result of the discussion may be summarised thus: The appellant had a fundamental right to carry (1) I.L.R. 1953 Mad, 3f30, 334.

It would be convenient at this stage, before entering into the controversial question, to state briefly some of the well-established principles relevant to the question raised:
To appreciate the rival contentions, it is necessary to consider the relevant provisions of the Act.
The Act, which is a Central Act, was passed in the year 1939 and subsequently it was amended from time to time both by Parliament and also by the local legislatures. The main object of the Act is to regulate the motor traffic in every State in the interest of the Vs public. Chapter 11 contains provisions relating to licensing of drivers of motor vehicles. Chapter III prescribes for the registration of motor vehicles. Chapter IV provides for the control of transport vehicles. Chapter V lays down the general provisions regarding construction, equipment and maintenance of motor vehicles. Chapter VI regulates the control of traffic. Chapter VIII deals with the insurance of motor vehicles against third party risks. Chapter IX defines the offences, lays down the penalties and prescribes the procedure for detecting offences and enforcing penalties. Chapter X deals with miscellaneous matters. Every Chapter contains a specific provision conferring a power on the State Government to make rules for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of that Chapter. To carry out the objects of the Act, the State Government is authorized to create a hierarchy of officers such as the State Transport Authority, the Regional Transport Authority, the Registering Authority, etc. Such Authorities are entrusted with administrative as well as quasi-judicial functions. Chapter IV with which we are now concerned follows the same pattern. Its general heading is " Control of Transport Vehicles ". Section 42 prohibits the owners of transport vehicles from using them in any public place without permits. Section 43 empowers the State Government to control road transport. Section 44 enables the State Government to constitute Transport Authorities to exercise and discharge the specified powers and functions. Under s. 44(4) the State Transport Authority is authorized to issue directions to any Regional Transport Authority and the latter shall be guided by such directions. Sections 46, 47, 48, 57, 60 and 64 prescribe the procedure for issue of permits and also create a hierarchy of Tribunals for hearing of applications and disposal of appeals. The said procedure is clearly quasi-judicial in character and has been held to be so by this Court. Sections 67 and 68 confer a power on the State Government to make rules to regulate the operation of transport carriages and also to make rules for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of this Chapter.
Under the aforesaid provisions and the rules made thereunder, the State Transport Authority is made the administrative head of all the other Transport Authorities functioning in the State, and the Central Road Traffic Board the appellate authority in the hierarchy of Tribunals constituted under the Act. As the administrative head the State Transport Authority is authorized under s. 44(4) of the Act to issue directions to any Regional Transport Authority, who shall be guided by such directions. As an appellate tribunal the Central Road Traffic Board is empowered to dispose of the appeals preferred against the orders made by the subordinate authorities under the Act in respect of specified matters. But the Central Act did not make any provision enabling the State Governments to control either the quasi-judicial or the administrative wings of the machinery provided under the Act. While the State Transport Authority could issue directions to other Transport Authorities constituted under the Act, a State Government could not likewise issue any directions either to the State Transport Authority or to its subordinate authorities. So too, while the Central Road Traffic Board could in its appellate jurisdiction set aside or modify the orders of the subordinate tribunals, the State Government was not in a position to set aside the improper orders of the tribunals under the Act. Presumably, therefore, to bring the said authorities under its control, both on the judicial and the administrative wings, Motor Vehicles (Madras Amendment) Act, 1948 ((Mad. XX of 1948), was passed and it became law on December 21, 1948. Among other amendments, ss. 43A and 64A were inserted in the Act. Section 43A reads:
Section 64A is to the following effect:
So far as s. 64A is concerned, in express terms it confers a judicial power on the State Government to keep a subordinate judicial tribunal within bounds. Section 64A, along with ss. 45 to 57, 60 and 64, forms a complete code in respect of the quasi-judicial disposals of the issue of permits. The permits should be issued in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the rules framed thereunder following the judicial procedure. The words used in s. 43A are very wide. It says that the State Government may issue orders and directions of a general character in respect of any matters relating to road transport. Divorced from the context and the setting in which the new section appears, it may comprehend any orders or directions of a general character in respect of road transport; and, if so construed, it would not only subvert the other provisions of the Act but also would be vulnerable to attack on the ground of constitutional invalidity. It would entrust the Government with a naked arbitrary power capable of being used to compel quasi-judicial tribunals to dispose of cases in a particular way; it would enable them to couch the order in a general way to induce a tribunal to come to a particular decision in a given case; and it would be destructive of the entire judicial procedure envisaged by the Act and the rules framed thereunder in the matter of disposal of specified questions. It would be attributing to the legislature an incongruity, for the State Government could issue directions in respect of which it could make rules ignoring the safeguards provided in the making of the rules. Section 133 lays down that every power to make rules given by the Act is subject to the condition of the rules being made after previous publication. It also enjoins on the Central and the State Governments to place the said rules for not less than fourteen days before the appropriate legislature and the rules so made shall be subject to such modification as the legislature may make in such session in which they are so laid. All these salutary precautions can be ignored if the directions given under s. 43A are given the status of law; on the other hand, if a restrictive meaning is given as it should be in the context, there would be a happy correlation of the functions of the various bodies under the Act, including the Government. The Government's legislative power is recognised under ss. 67 and 68 of the Act; its judicial power is maintained under s. 64A and its administrative power is affirmed under s. 43A. Chapter IV and the rules made thereunder confer adminis- trative powers on the Regional Transport Authorities and the State Transport Authority. Section 43A enables the State Government to make orders and issue directions of a general character in respect of those functions to implement the provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder; and the said authorities shall give effect to all such orders and directions.
The context in which and the setting wherein the section is inserted also lend support to the said conclusion. Section 42 describes the necessity for permits and s. 43 confers specific powers on the Government to control road transport. Section 43A coming thereafter and before the sections conferring quasi-judicial powers on tribunals is indicative of the fact that the jurisdiction conferred under s. 43A is confined to administrative functions of the Government and the tribunals rather than to their judicial functions; for, if the section was intended to confer legislative power, it should have found its place after s. 64A or somewhere near the end of the Chapter. Though it is not a conclusive test, the placing of the provisions of ss. 43A and 64A, which were inserted by the same Amending Act is also a pointer to the intention of the legislature, namely, that s. 43A was intended to govern administrative functions of the tribunals. The terms of the section and the manner of issuing orders and directions thereunder also support the same conclusion. The legislature used two words in the section: (i) order and
(2) A.I.R. 1957 A.P. 882.
on his motor transport business subject to reasonable restrictions imposed upon that right by law. Some of the provisions of Chapter IV of the Act contain reasonable restrictions on the said right. He was given a permit on the basis of the law imposing the said restrictions on his right. The orders made and the directions issued under s. 43A could cover only the administrative field of the officers concerned and therefore any direction issued thereunder was not law regulating the rights of the parties. The order made and the directions issued under s. 43A of the Act cannot obviously add to the considerations prescribed under s. 47 on the basis of which the tribunal is empowered to issue or refuse permit, as the case may be. There was, therefore, no change in the law pending the appeal so as to affect the appellant's vested right in this view, the appellant cannot question the validity of the order of the Central Road Traffic Board on the ground that it decided the appeal on a law that was made subsequent to the issue of the permit to him.
We are not concerned with the State Transport Authority in this case. The Act is a Central Act and s. 43-A was introduced into it by an amendment made by the legislature of the Province of Madras. The Government of Madras from time to time issued orders under this section providing certain considerations for the guidance of the Regional Transport Authorities in deciding applications for the rant of permits for stage carriages. The appellant's contention is that the permit was refused to it by applying one of these orders which was not applicable to its case. Section 64 of the Act permits an appeal to an appellate authority from an order of a Regional Transport Authority refusing to grant a permit. This appellate authority in the State of Madras is called the Central Road Traffic Board. Section 64- A which again was introduced into the Act by an amendment of the legislature of the Province of Madras, empowers the Government to look into the records of any case concerning the grant of a permit and pass such order as it thought fit.
Before leaving the case I wish to express my opinion on a matter which was pressed on behalf of the respondent. It was said that only administrative orders could be made under s. 43-A which orders were not laws, and therefore an error with regard to them would not be an error of law which would warrant the issue of a certiorari. I am unable to assent to this contention. To my mind the question is not solved by describing the orders as administrative orders, a term as to the meaning of which, I confess, I am not clear. So it does not seem to me to be necessary to enquire what kind of orders could be issued under s. 43-A. In my view if an order under the section is one to the observance of which a person is entitled, that would be a law, a mistake of which would justify the issue of the writ at his instance. The whole justification for a writ of certiorari is to prevent, where no other remedy is available, a patent injustice being allowed to stand. It would be strange if a person was entitled to the observance of a rule and was held not to have a remedy for its breach. It can make no difference by what name that rule is called. I wish to read here as a salutary advice to follow, what Pollock C. B. and Martin B. said in The Mayor of Rochester v. The Queen (1) regarding the writ, " Instead of being astute to discover reasons for not applying this great constitutional remedy for error and mis-government, we think it our duty to be vigilant to apply it in every case to which, by any reasonable construction, it can be made applicable."
with which we are dealing. I think they clearly were. The orders were made under a statutory provision. That itself would make them binding. Further, the statute expressly says that the " Transport Authority shall give effect to all such orders and directions ". The statute applies to all; every one is entitled to the benefit of it. Any person interested has therefore a right to claim that an order passed under the section shall be observed by the Transport Authorities. The respondent himself made such a claim and has got the benefit of one of these orders.
It was however said that it is true that the Transport Authorities owed a duty to observe the orders but that was a duty they owed to the Government alone and that a breach of this duty only exposed them to disciplinary action by the Government but did not vitiate their decisions. I find no words in the section so to limit the scope of the duty imposed by it on the Transport Authorities. The nature of the orders makes it impossible to think that it was intended to visit a breach by disciplinary action only. These orders lay down principles to be applied in deciding whether a person should or should not be given a permit. They affect persons materially ; they affect persons' living . I find it very difficult to think that the only sanction for such rules can be disciplinary action. It seems to me abhorrent that judicial bodies should in the discharge of their functions be subjected to disciplinary action. Then I think it would certainly be a very unusual statute which sets up quasi-judicial tribunals with power to affect people materially and binds the tribunals on pain of disciplinary action only to proceed according to rules made under its authority but gives the persons deeply affected by the tribunal's decision no right to claim that the rules should be observed. I am unable to hold that the Motor Vehicles Act is a statute of this kind.	Section
have at least this retrospective effect. If it did, which on the form of the order it may well be said to have done, then that would be another reason for saying that it is not clear that the Board was in error in applying it. In my view therefore it has not been shown that the Board committed an error apparent on the face of its decision in applying G. O. Ms. No. 1037 to the appellant's case. This appeal must therefore fail.
The real question thus is whether the applicants for permits were entitled to the observance of the orders (1) (1858) EL. BL. & EL. 1024,1033; 120 E.R. 791.
For the reasons earlier mentioned, however, I agree that the appeal should be dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.	Conclusion
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 37 of 1958. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated September 14, 1956, of the Madras High Court in Writ Appeal No. 64 of 1956, arising out of the judgment and order dated May 1, 1956, of the said High Court in Writ Petition No. 852 of 1955.

1959. February 18. The judgment of Imam and Subba Rao, JJ., was delivered by Subba Rao, J. Sarkar, J., delivered a separate judgment.
SUBBA RAO, J.-This appeal by Special Leave against the judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Madras raises the question of interpretation of S. 43A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 (IV of 1939), as amended by the Motor Vehicles (Madras Amendment) Act, 1948 (Mad. XX of 1948), hereinafter referred to as the Act. On February 19, 1955, the Regional Transport Authority, Tanjore, Madras State, the second respondent herein, called for applications under s. 57(2) of the Act for grant of a stage carriage permit on the Saliamangalam Kodavasal route. The appellant and the fourth respondent, K. M. Shanmugam, Proprietor, K. M. S. Transport, Ammapet, Tanjore District, along with others, applied for the grant of the said permit. The Regional Transport Authority at its meeting held on April 19, 1955, after hearing the representations of the applicants, granted the permit to the appellant. The fourth respondent and two others preferred appeals against the said order to the Central Road Traffic Board, Madras, the third respondent herein. The Central Road Traffic, Board by its order dated June 25, 1955, set aside the order of the Regional Transport Authority and granted the permit to the fourth respondent. The appellant preferred a Revision Petition against that order to the first respondent, the State of Madras, but the first respondent rejected the petition by its order dated October 14, 1955. Thereafter, the appellant filed a Writ Petition (No. 852 of 1955) in the High Court of Madras under Art. 226 of the Constitution to quash the orders of the Central Road Traffic Board and the State of Madras. Rajagopalan, J., of the said High Court by his order dated May 1, 1956, quashed the order of the Government and directed the State Transport Appellate Tribunal which had been constituted in place of the Central Road Traffic Board to dispose of the appeal in accordance with law. Against the judgment of the learned Judge, the fourth respondent preferred an appeal under the Letters Patent and the Appellate Bench of that High Court, consisting of Rajamannar, C. J., and Ramaswami, J., set aside the order of RajagopaIan, J., and restored the order of the Central Road Traffic Board. The appellant with special leave filed the present appeal against that judgment of the High Court.
Mr. Pathak, appearing for the appellant, raised before us the following two points: (i) The appeal filed by the fourth respondent against the order of the Regional Transport Authority to the Central Road Traffic Board was barred by limitation and the Board acted illegally in disposing of the appeal without deciding the question of limitation; and (ii) the appellant had the fundamental right to carry on the business of transport subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by law as on the date he applied for a permit or at any rate when the Regional Transport Authority issued the permit to him, and that the Central Road Traffic Board committed an error, evident on the face of the record, in disposing of the appeal in accordance with the new restrictions imposed by law made pending the appeal before it. Stated as a legal proposition, the contention is that the appellant had acquired a vested right to carry on the business of transport and that the same could not be defeated by a subsequent law made pending the appeal, which was only prospective in character.
The first argument need not detain us, for the learned Counsel, in view of the finding of the High Court that as a matter of fact the appeal to the Central Road Traffic Board was not barred, fairly did not press it before us. This leaves us with the second and the only argument in the case. To appreciate the contention it is necessary to set out some more relevant facts: On March 28, 1953, the Government made an order, G. O. Ms. No. 1037 Home, purporting to be under s. 43A of the Act. The material part of that order reads:
On November 15, 1954, in supersession of paragraph 2 of the above order, the Government issued an order, G. O. Ms. No. 3353 Home, to the following effect:
The Government also directs that in order to facilitate the amalgamation of existing small units into viable units transfer of permits shall be allowed liberally." On June 15, 1955, the Government issued another order, G. O. Ms. No. 1689 Home, whereby the Central Road Traffic Board was informed that pending further orders of Government after re-examination of the question of formation of viable units of stage carriages, the orders in para. (2) of G. O. Ms. No. 1037 Home dated 28th March, 1953, would be in force. The effect of this order was that the first order was restored pending final orders.
When the Regional Transport Authority issued the permit in favour of the appellant, G. O. Ms. No. 3353 Home dated 15th November, 1954, was in force, and when the Central Road Traffic Board made the order giving the permit to the fourth respondent, G. O. Ms. No. 1689 Home dated 15th June, 1955, was in operation. Apart from other considerations, the Regional Transport Authority relied upon the former G. O. in preferring the appellant to other applicants, while the Central Road Traffic Board referred to G. O. Ms. No. 1037 Home dated 28th March, 1953, which was restored by the later G. O. in preferring the fourth respondent to the appellant. We shall give further details of the orders of the Regional Transport Authority and the Appellate Tribunal in the context of another argument, but, for the present, the aforesaid facts would suffice.
It would be convenient at this stage, before entering into the controversial question, to state briefly some of the well-established principles relevant to the question raised:
To appreciate the rival contentions, it is necessary to consider the relevant provisions of the Act.

The Act, which is a Central Act, was passed in the year 1939 and subsequently it was amended from time to time both by Parliament and also by the local legislatures. The main object of the Act is to regulate the motor traffic in every State in the interest of the Vs public. Chapter 11 contains provisions relating to licensing of drivers of motor vehicles. Chapter III prescribes for the registration of motor vehicles. Chapter IV provides for the control of transport vehicles. Chapter V lays down the general provisions regarding construction, equipment and maintenance of motor vehicles. Chapter VI regulates the control of traffic. Chapter VIII deals with the insurance of motor vehicles against third party risks. Chapter IX defines the offences, lays down the penalties and prescribes the procedure for detecting offences and enforcing penalties. Chapter X deals with miscellaneous matters. Every Chapter contains a specific provision conferring a power on the State Government to make rules for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of that Chapter. To carry out the objects of the Act, the State Government is authorized to create a hierarchy of officers such as the State Transport Authority, the Regional Transport Authority, the Registering Authority, etc. Such Authorities are entrusted with administrative as well as quasi-judicial functions. Chapter IV with which we are now concerned follows the same pattern. Its general heading is " Control of Transport Vehicles ". Section 42 prohibits the owners of transport vehicles from using them in any public place without permits. Section 43 empowers the State Government to control road transport. Section 44 enables the State Government to constitute Transport Authorities to exercise and discharge the specified powers and functions. Under s. 44(4) the State Transport Authority is authorized to issue directions to any Regional Transport Authority and the latter shall be guided by such directions. Sections 46, 47, 48, 57, 60 and 64 prescribe the procedure for issue of permits and also create a hierarchy of Tribunals for hearing of applications and disposal of appeals. The said procedure is clearly quasi-judicial in character and has been held to be so by this Court. Sections 67 and 68 confer a power on the State Government to make rules to regulate the operation of transport carriages and also to make rules for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of this Chapter.
Under the aforesaid provisions and the rules made thereunder, the State Transport Authority is made the administrative head of all the other Transport Authorities functioning in the State, and the Central Road Traffic Board the appellate authority in the hierarchy of Tribunals constituted under the Act. As the administrative head the State Transport Authority is authorized under s. 44(4) of the Act to issue directions to any Regional Transport Authority, who shall be guided by such directions. As an appellate tribunal the Central Road Traffic Board is empowered to dispose of the appeals preferred against the orders made by the subordinate authorities under the Act in respect of specified matters. But the Central Act did not make any provision enabling the State Governments to control either the quasi-judicial or the administrative wings of the machinery provided under the Act. While the State Transport Authority could issue directions to other Transport Authorities constituted under the Act, a State Government could not likewise issue any directions either to the State Transport Authority or to its subordinate authorities. So too, while the Central Road Traffic Board could in its appellate jurisdiction set aside or modify the orders of the subordinate tribunals, the State Government was not in a position to set aside the improper orders of the tribunals under the Act. Presumably, therefore, to bring the said authorities under its control, both on the judicial and the administrative wings, Motor Vehicles (Madras Amendment) Act, 1948 ((Mad. XX of 1948), was passed and it became law on December 21, 1948. Among other amendments, ss. 43A and 64A were inserted in the Act. Section 43A reads:
Section 64A is to the following effect:
So far as s. 64A is concerned, in express terms it confers a judicial power on the State Government to keep a subordinate judicial tribunal within bounds. Section 64A, along with ss. 45 to 57, 60 and 64, forms a complete code in respect of the quasi-judicial disposals of the issue of permits. The permits should be issued in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the rules framed thereunder following the judicial procedure. The words used in s. 43A are very wide. It says that the State Government may issue orders and directions of a general character in respect of any matters relating to road transport. Divorced from the context and the setting in which the new section appears, it may comprehend any orders or directions of a general character in respect of road transport; and, if so construed, it would not only subvert the other provisions of the Act but also would be vulnerable to attack on the ground of constitutional invalidity. It would entrust the Government with a naked arbitrary power capable of being used to compel quasi-judicial tribunals to dispose of cases in a particular way; it would enable them to couch the order in a general way to induce a tribunal to come to a particular decision in a given case; and it would be destructive of the entire judicial procedure envisaged by the Act and the rules framed thereunder in the matter of disposal of specified questions. It would be attributing to the legislature an incongruity, for the State Government could issue directions in respect of which it could make rules ignoring the safeguards provided in the making of the rules. Section 133 lays down that every power to make rules given by the Act is subject to the condition of the rules being made after previous publication. It also enjoins on the Central and the State Governments to place the said rules for not less than fourteen days before the appropriate legislature and the rules so made shall be subject to such modification as the legislature may make in such session in which they are so laid. All these salutary precautions can be ignored if the directions given under s. 43A are given the status of law; on the other hand, if a restrictive meaning is given as it should be in the context, there would be a happy correlation of the functions of the various bodies under the Act, including the Government. The Government's legislative power is recognised under ss. 67 and 68 of the Act; its judicial power is maintained under s. 64A and its administrative power is affirmed under s. 43A. Chapter IV and the rules made thereunder confer adminis- trative powers on the Regional Transport Authorities and the State Transport Authority. Section 43A enables the State Government to make orders and issue directions of a general character in respect of those functions to implement the provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder; and the said authorities shall give effect to all such orders and directions.
The context in which and the setting wherein the section is inserted also lend support to the said conclusion. Section 42 describes the necessity for permits and s. 43 confers specific powers on the Government to control road transport. Section 43A coming thereafter and before the sections conferring quasi-judicial powers on tribunals is indicative of the fact that the jurisdiction conferred under s. 43A is confined to administrative functions of the Government and the tribunals rather than to their judicial functions; for, if the section was intended to confer legislative power, it should have found its place after s. 64A or somewhere near the end of the Chapter. Though it is not a conclusive test, the placing of the provisions of ss. 43A and 64A, which were inserted by the same Amending Act is also a pointer to the intention of the legislature, namely, that s. 43A was intended to govern administrative functions of the tribunals. The terms of the section and the manner of issuing orders and directions thereunder also support the same conclusion. The legislature used two words in the section: (i) order and
(ii) directions. Whenever it intended to affect the rights of parties, it used the word " rules ", but in this section it designedly used the words appropriate to the control of administrative machinery. The words " directions and order " are defined in one of the Law Lexicons thus: " Direction contains most of instruction in it; order most of authority. Directions should be followed; orders obeyed. It is necessary to direct those who are unable to act for themselves; it is necessary to order those whose business it is to execute the orders. " The said meaning of the words is more appropriate to administrative control rather than to rules of law affecting rights of parties. Further, the declaration in the section that the orders and the directions under the section shall be binding on the authorities concerned is indicative of the fact that they are not laws, for if they are laws, no such declaration is necessary. What is more, they need not even be published and may, if the Government so desires, take the form of secret communication to the authorities concerned. Nor is there any basis for the argument that as the directions are issued under a statutory power, they are " laws ". The source of the power does not affect the character of the things done in exercise of that power. Whether it is a law or an administrative direction depends upon the character or nature of the orders or directions authorized to be issued in exercise of the power conferred. That should be determined on other considerations adverted to by us already. Our view is in accord with that expressed by a Division Bench of the Madras High Court in C. S. S. Motor Service, Tenkasi v. The State of Madras (1). There the constitutional validity of ss. 42, 43A, 47, 48 and 64A of the Act was questioned. In dealing with s. 43A, Venkatarama Ayyar, J., who delivered the judgment of the Court, observed at p. 335 thus (1) I.L.R. 1953 Mad. 304, 330, 334.
From the aforesaid observations, it is manifest that the learned Judge construed s. 43A as conferring a power on the State Government to issue directions of an administrative character. If the construction was otherwise, the learned Judge would have held that the section was constitutionally bad as he had held in regard to other sections. The High Court of Andhra Pradesh in Gopalakrishna Motor Transport Co. Ltd. v. Secretary, Regional Transport Authority, Krishna District, Vijayawada (2) had also considered the scope of the provisions of s. 43A. There, the State Government issued an order under s. 43A of the Act prescribing the manner of checking a bus for over-
(1) (1948) 1 M.L.J. 85.
(2) A.I.R. 1957 A.P. 882.
loading. The procedure prescribed was not followed by the Regional Transport Authority, which was empowered to suspend the permit on the ground of overloading under s. 60 of the Act. One of the contentions raised was that as the mandatory direction given by s the State Government under s. 43A was not followed, the Regional Transport Authority in exercising its powers under s. 60 should have held that there was no over-loading. In rejecting this plea, the High Court observed at p. 885 thus:
In the present case, the learned Chief Justice, who was a party to the decision in C. S. S. Motor Service v. The State of Madras (1), presumably on the basis of that judgment observed thus:
The result of the discussion may be summarised thus: The appellant had a fundamental right to carry (1) I.L.R. 1953 Mad, 3f30, 334.
on his motor transport business subject to reasonable restrictions imposed upon that right by law. Some of the provisions of Chapter IV of the Act contain reasonable restrictions on the said right. He was given a permit on the basis of the law imposing the said restrictions on his right. The orders made and the directions issued under s. 43A could cover only the administrative field of the officers concerned and therefore any direction issued thereunder was not law regulating the rights of the parties. The order made and the directions issued under s. 43A of the Act cannot obviously add to the considerations prescribed under s. 47 on the basis of which the tribunal is empowered to issue or refuse permit, as the case may be. There was, therefore, no change in the law pending the appeal so as to affect the appellant's vested right in this view, the appellant cannot question the validity of the order of the Central Road Traffic Board on the ground that it decided the appeal on a law that was made subsequent to the issue of the permit to him.
The same result could be arrived at by different process of reasoning. The appellant had a fundamental right to carry on the business of motor transport subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by law under Art. 19(6) of the Constitution. The Act imposed reasonable restrictions oil the said right. One such restriction was that the State Government may issue such orders and directions of a general character as it' may consider necessary in respect of any matter relating to road transport to the State Transport Authority. When the appellant applied for a permit, be must be deemed to have bad the knowledge of the fact that his application would be disposed of by the State Transport Authority in accordance with orders and directions of a general character issued, by the State Government. The directions were not now law that came into existence pending the appeal, but only issued under a law that was in existence even at the time he applied for a permit. The law was that embodied in s. 43A of the Act, namely, that the Government could issue directions binding on the authorities concerned and that law was a pre-existing one and the application had to be disposed of subject to that law till it was finally terminated by an order of the highest tribunal in the hierarchy. In this view also there are no merits in the appellant's contention.
Now coming to the merits of the case, the contentions of the parties may be stated thus: The learned Counsel for the respondents contends that there is no material difference between G. O. Ms. No. 1037 and G. O. Ms. No. 3353, except in regard to one circumstance, which is not material for the present purpose: while in the former G. O., the argument proceeds, the transport authority is directed to work up to a minimum of five units with a spare bus, under the latter G. O., the viable unit fixed is not less than ten buses and the authority concerned is directed to work up to that limit. It is pointed out that the only difference, is in the measure of a viable unit and that the fourth respondent's case falls squarely within the first category in the order of preference prescribed in G. O. Ms. No. 3353 of 1954. The learned Counsel for the appellant contends that the order of preference is based upon the achievement of the object, namely, building up of viable units of ten permits and that the appellant admittedly had only four permits and, therefore, far below the viable unit and he could not be given preference in a competition between him and the appellant, who had more than thirty permits. The problem presented can only be solved by a reasonable inter- pretation of the plain words used in G. O. Ms. No. 3353 of 1954 read along with the expressed object sought to be achieved thereby. It will be convenient at this stage to read the said order omitting the unnecessary words:
The G. O., Was issued to achieve the object of inducing the operators to amalgamate wherever possible, into big viable units to enable them to achieved better returns and maintain better standards of operation. The Government decided that a unit of at least ten buses would be necessary to achieve that object. To implement that policy, it directed that each viable stage carriage unit should consist of not less than ten buses and with a view to build up such viable units, it directed that, other things being equal, the order of preference contained therein should be followed. The order of preference contained three categories, one ex- cluding the other. They did not provide for any rules of preference inter se of operators coming within each one of the categories. Presumably, that was left to be decided by the transport authorities, having regard to the considerations mentioned in s. 47. The argument of the learned Counsel for the fourth respondent is based upon the first category, which reads:
We are not concerned with the State Transport Authority in this case. The Act is a Central Act and s. 43-A was introduced into it by an amendment made by the legislature of the Province of Madras. The Government of Madras from time to time issued orders under this section providing certain considerations for the guidance of the Regional Transport Authorities in deciding applications for the rant of permits for stage carriages. The appellant's contention is that the permit was refused to it by applying one of these orders which was not applicable to its case. Section 64 of the Act permits an appeal to an appellate authority from an order of a Regional Transport Authority refusing to grant a permit. This appellate authority in the State of Madras is called the Central Road Traffic Board. Section 64- A which again was introduced into the Act by an amendment of the legislature of the Province of Madras, empowers the Government to look into the records of any case concerning the grant of a permit and pass such order as it thought fit.
Now as to the facts of this case, on March 28, 1953, the Government issued an order tinder s. 43-A marked G. O. Ms. No. 1037 laying down certain considerations to be observed in granting permits. On November 15, 1954, the Government issued another order marked G. O. Ms. No. 3353 superseding the second of G. O. Ms. No. 1037 and substituting fresh provisions in its place. As I do not consider it necessary to discuss the terms of these orders, it will tend to clarity to proceed on the basis as if G. O. Ms. No. 3353 superseded G. O. Ms. No. 1037 wholly. The appellant, the respondent No. 4 and eight other persons had applied for the permit for a route for which applications had been invited. It does not appear from the record when these applications had been made, but it appears that on April 9, 1955, the Regional Transport Authority after hearing all the competing applicants granted the permit to the appellant applying G. O. Ms. No. 3353, this being the order then in force. Soon thereafter, namely, on May 20, 1955, the Government passed under the same section a fresh order being ('J. O. Ms. No. 1403 cancelling G. O. Ms. No. 3353 and on June 15, 1955, it passed another order being G. O. Ms. No. 1689 which, for the purpose of this case it may be said, had the effect of restoring G. O. Ms. No. 1037.
On or about June 23, 1955, the respondent No. 4, who will be referred to as the respondent as he is the only contesting respondent, preferred an appeal to the Central Road Traffic Board against the decision of the Regional Transport Authority. It may be that some of the other disappointed applicants for the permit also preferred similar appeals but with them we are not concerned. The Board considered the representations of all the parties before it and made an order on June 25, 1955, setting aside the decision of the Regional Transport Authority and granting the permit to the respondent. According to the appellant, in making this order the Board followed G. O. Ms. No. 1037. The complaint of the appellant is that the Board went wrong in doing so as G. O. Ms. No. 1037 was not in force when the appellant's application was considered by the Regional Transport Authority but had been brought into force subsequently, and as the Board was only hearing an appeal from the Regional Transport Authority it was bound to decide the case according to the order in force when the Regional Transport Authority made its decision and was not entitled to decide it according to an order which came into existence subsequently. The appellant took the matter up to the Government under s. 64-A of the Act but the Government refused to interfere.
The appellant then moved the High Court at Madras for a writ of certiorari quashing the orders of the Board granting the permit to the respondent and of the Government refusing to interfere. Rajagopalan, J., who heard the application, thought that the Government had failed to exercise its jurisdiction by not deciding a point raised before it, namely, whether the appeal to the Board had been made within the prescribed time. He, therefore, set aside the order of the Government and sent the case back for reconsideration. The respondent went up in appeal from the order of Rajagopalan, J. The appeal was heard by a bench of the same High Court consisting of Rajamannar, C. J., and Ramaswami, J., and was allowed. The learned Chief Justice who delivered the judgment of the court, held that Rajagopalan, J., was not right in thinking that the Government had failed to decide whether the appeal to the Board had been filed by the respondent within the prescribed time. He rejected the contention of the appellant that the order of the Board was liable to be set aside inasmuch as it had been made pursuant to G. O. Ms. No. 1037 which was not the order in force when the Regional Transport Authority heard the matter. He observed, " these Government orders, which are in the nature of general administrative directions to the transport authorities, do not vest any rights, indefeasible rights-in any applicant for a stage carriage permit ". He also held, "
have at least this retrospective effect. If it did, which on the form of the order it may well be said to have done, then that would be another reason for saying that it is not clear that the Board was in error in applying it. In my view therefore it has not been shown that the Board committed an error apparent on the face of its decision in applying G. O. Ms. No. 1037 to the appellant's case. This appeal must therefore fail.
Before leaving the case I wish to express my opinion on a matter which was pressed on behalf of the respondent. It was said that only administrative orders could be made under s. 43-A which orders were not laws, and therefore an error with regard to them would not be an error of law which would warrant the issue of a certiorari. I am unable to assent to this contention. To my mind the question is not solved by describing the orders as administrative orders, a term as to the meaning of which, I confess, I am not clear. So it does not seem to me to be necessary to enquire what kind of orders could be issued under s. 43-A. In my view if an order under the section is one to the observance of which a person is entitled, that would be a law, a mistake of which would justify the issue of the writ at his instance. The whole justification for a writ of certiorari is to prevent, where no other remedy is available, a patent injustice being allowed to stand. It would be strange if a person was entitled to the observance of a rule and was held not to have a remedy for its breach. It can make no difference by what name that rule is called. I wish to read here as a salutary advice to follow, what Pollock C. B. and Martin B. said in The Mayor of Rochester v. The Queen (1) regarding the writ, " Instead of being astute to discover reasons for not applying this great constitutional remedy for error and mis-government, we think it our duty to be vigilant to apply it in every case to which, by any reasonable construction, it can be made applicable."
The real question thus is whether the applicants for permits were entitled to the observance of the orders (1) (1858) EL. BL. & EL. 1024,1033; 120 E.R. 791.
with which we are dealing. I think they clearly were. The orders were made under a statutory provision. That itself would make them binding. Further, the statute expressly says that the " Transport Authority shall give effect to all such orders and directions ". The statute applies to all; every one is entitled to the benefit of it. Any person interested has therefore a right to claim that an order passed under the section shall be observed by the Transport Authorities. The respondent himself made such a claim and has got the benefit of one of these orders.
It was however said that it is true that the Transport Authorities owed a duty to observe the orders but that was a duty they owed to the Government alone and that a breach of this duty only exposed them to disciplinary action by the Government but did not vitiate their decisions. I find no words in the section so to limit the scope of the duty imposed by it on the Transport Authorities. The nature of the orders makes it impossible to think that it was intended to visit a breach by disciplinary action only. These orders lay down principles to be applied in deciding whether a person should or should not be given a permit. They affect persons materially ; they affect persons' living . I find it very difficult to think that the only sanction for such rules can be disciplinary action. It seems to me abhorrent that judicial bodies should in the discharge of their functions be subjected to disciplinary action. Then I think it would certainly be a very unusual statute which sets up quasi-judicial tribunals with power to affect people materially and binds the tribunals on pain of disciplinary action only to proceed according to rules made under its authority but gives the persons deeply affected by the tribunal's decision no right to claim that the rules should be observed. I am unable to hold that the Motor Vehicles Act is a statute of this kind.
I ought to refer to the case of Nagendra Nath Bora v. The Commissioner of Hills Division and Appeals, Assam (1). That was a case concerning a licensing authority for liquor
-hops. It was there said that a (1) [1958] S-C.R. 1240.
breach of certain executive instructions issued to the licensing authority did not amount to error of law. I think that case is clearly distinguishable. It dealt with executive instructions and therefore not such as were issued under a statutory power. There is nothing to show that it was the bounden duty of the tribunal, the licensing authority, to obey these instructions. Had it not been that a hierachy of appeals had been provided for, it would perhaps have been held in that case that the authority was not a quasi-judicial authority at all. Furthermore, it was held there that no one had an inherent right to a settlement of a liquor shop. Therefore it seems to me that that case does not help in deciding the effect of the orders issued under s. 43-A. It is interesting to note that it was said in that case referring to the writ of certiorari at p. 412 that, " its purpose is only to determine, on an examination of the record, whether the inferior tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction or has not proceeded in accordance with the essential requirements of law which it was meant to administer." The words " law which it was meant to administer " are very significant. The Transport Authorities in the present case were certainly meant to administer the orders issued under s. 43-A. There is one thing more that I wish to observe in this connection. It may be that an order which it is the bounden duty of the Transport Authority to obey may give it a certain amount of discretion, but that in my view would riot make the order any the less a law. If the discretion has been duly exercised, there would be no error of law for the law itself gives the discretion. It would be the bounden duty of the tribunal to observe that law and so if necessary to exercise the discretion given by it.
For the reasons earlier mentioned, however, I agree that the appeal should be dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.	Total Judgement
