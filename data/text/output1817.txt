1961. January 27. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by RAGHUBAR DAYAL, J.-This is an appeal by special Rag leave by Ardeshir H. Bhiwandiwala against the order of the High Court of Bombay allowing an appeal by the State against the acquittal of the appellant of an offence under s. 92 of the Factories Act, 1948 (Act LXIII of 1948), hereinafter called the Act, for his working the Wadia Mahal Salt Works situate at Wadala, Bombay, without obtaining a licence under s. 6 of the said Act read with r. 4 of the rules framed under the Act. The main question for determination in this appeal is whether these Salt Works come within the definition of the word " factory " under cl. (m) of s. 2 of the Act. The answer to this question depends on the meaning of the word "
or..............	Issue
manufacturing process " in cl. (k) of s. 2 of the Act. The Salt Works extend over an area of about two hundred and fifty acres. Some of the other salt works, however, have even larger areas. The only buildings on this land consist of temporary shelters constructed for the resident labour and for an office. At a few places, pucca platforms exist for fixing the water pump when required to pump water from the sea. When not required, this pump is kept in the office. With the exception of the constructions already mentioned, the entire area of the Salt Works is open. On the sea side, it has bunds in order to prevent sea water flooding the salt pans.
It is contended for the appellant that the expres. sion "premises" in the definition of the word "factory" means "

Hannen, J., said:
It is not clear from these observations alone why the slate quarries where work was carried on in the open air and not in building, was not held to be "a factory" on that account. This is, however, apparent when one considers that the Factory Act of 1833 was enacted to regulate the labour of children and young persons in the mills and factories of the United Kingdom and applied only to cotton, woollen, worsted, hemp, flax, tow, linen or silk mill or factory wherein steam or water or any other mechanical power was used to propel or work the machinery in such mill or factory. The other subsequent Acts simply extended the scope of the Factory Act of 1833. The Act of 1844 was to amend the law relating to labour in ,,factories and provided by s. LXXIII that "the Factory Act as amended by this Act and this Act "
The next case relied on is Redgrave v. Lee (2 ). The earlier decision was just followed in this.
The next case cited for the appellant is Nash v. Hollin shead (3). This case too is distinguishable as the farm on which the workman was employed to drive a movable steam engine for the purpose of working a (1) (1869) L.R. 5 Q.B. 19. (2) (1874) 9 Q.B. 363. (3) [1901] 1 K.B. 700.
manufacturing process ".
inasmuch as salt can be said to have been manufactured from sea water by the process of treatment and adaptation of sea water into salt. The sea water, a non-commercial article, has been adapted to salt, a commercial article. The observations in Sedgwick v. Watney Combe, Reid & Company, Limited(1) at page 463, support the (1) [1931] A.C. 446, view that the process undergone at the Salt Works is the process of treatment 'of sea water for the purpose of converting it into salt. The hereditament, the subject of controversy in the case, was used in connection with the manufacture of " bottled beer " by the respondent. Brewed beer, which was not in a drinkable condition, and therefore not saleable as draught' beer, was brought to the premises in tank wagons and pumped into large tanks. Carbonic acid gas was put into it. It was then filtered and put into bottles which were corked and labelled. The bottles were then packed and removed for delivery. The question for decision was whether the hereditament was occupied and used for the purpose of distributive wholesale business. In that connection it was said:
In the present case, in the Salt Works, the finished article is " salt ". It does not enter the Salt Works as " salt ". It enters as brine which, under the process carried out, changes its quality, and becomes salt, a marketable article. The observations in Grove v. Lloyds British Testing Co. Ltd.(1) at page 467 support the view that the conversion of sea water into salt amounts to adapting it for sale. It is stated there :
In Kaye v. Burrows & Others and Hines v. Eastern Counties Farmers' Co operative Association Ltd. (2) it was said at page 484:
In The State of Kerala v. V. M. Patel (1) this Court held the treatment of pepper and ginger to be a " manufacturing process " where the work which was carried on in the premises of the firm was described thus :"
The case reported as In re: Chinniah, Manager, Sangu Soap Works (2) is of no help to the appellant as there nothing definite was held about the process carried out to be a manufacturing process or not and what was stated was in connection with the word I( manufacture" in general and not with reference to " manufacturing process." Similarly the case reported as Paterson v. Hunt is not of much help. It simply held that mere sorting of rags will not amount to adapting for sale. In this case reference was made to it being held in Law v. Graham (4) that washing the bottles before the beer was put into them was not adapting the beer, or adapting the bottles or adapting the bottled beer for the purpose of sale and in Hoare v. Truman, Hanbury, Buxton & Co. (5) that it was a case of adapting for sale when gas was used to force carbonic acid at high pressure into the beer for charging it with the acid and mixing it and so aerating the beer. The case is (1) Crl.App. NO. 42 of 1959. decided on October 12, 1960. (2) A.I.R. 1957 Mad. 755.
distinguishable as sorting of rags brought about no change in particular rags sorted out. They were just separated from other things with which they were mixed and therefore the rags were in no way adapted to some different article. This cannot be said in connection with the conversion of sea water into salt.
The decisions in McNicol v. Pinch (1), State v. Chrestien Mica Industries Ltd. (2) and G. R. Kulkarni v. The State (3) are of no help in determining the point under consideration as there the word " manufacture " was interpreted according to the dictionary meaning and the context. In the present case, we are considering the definition of the expression "	Precedent
Clause (m) of s. 2 of the Act reads:
The relevant portion of the definition of " manufacturing process " in cl. (k) of s. 2, reads :
(b) Cochran's Law Lexicon, IV Edition: "
Premises............ from this use of the word, " premises " has gradually acquired the popular sense of land or buildings.
Originally, it was only used in this sense by laymen, and it was never so used in well-drawn instruments, but it is now frequently found in instruments and in Acts of Parliament as meaning land or houses, e.g., the Public Health Act, 1875, s. 4, where "premises" includes messuages, buildings, lands, easements, tenements and hereditaments of any tenure......
(e) Ballentine, J.A., Law Dictionary with Pronunciation, II Edition:
premises including precincts" does not necessarily mean that the premises must always have precincts. Even buildings need not have any precincts. The word " including " is not a term restricting the meaning of the word " premises " but is a term which enlarges the scope of the word " premises ". We are therefore of opinion that even this contention is not sound and does not lead to the only conclusion that the word " premises " must be restricted to mean buildings and be not taken to cover open land as well.
Sub-cl. (bb) of el. (1) of s. 7 of the Act requires the occupier of a factory to mention in the written notice to be sent to the Chief Inspector before his occupying or using any premises as a factory, the name and address of the owner of the premises or building including the precincts thereof referred to in s. 93. This sufficiently indicates that the word " premises " is not restricted in scope to buildings alone. of course, the building referred to in this clause is the building which is referred to in s. 93 of the Act. Sub-s. (1) of s. 93 reads:
This again makes it clear that " premises " refer to an entire area which may have within it several separate buildings.
Further, s. 85 empowers the State Government to declare that all or any of the provisions of the Act shall apply to any place wherein a manufacturing 'process is carried on with or without the aid of power or is so ordinarily carried on notwithstanding certain matters mentioned in the section. The word " place" is again a general word which is applicable to both open land and to buildings and its use in this section indicates that the Act can be applied to works carrying on a manufacturing process on open land. There is thus internal evidence in the Act itself to show that the word " premises " is not to be confined in its meaning to buildings alone.
The High Court has rightly pointed out that the Act is for the welfare of the workers and deals with matters connected with the health, safety, welfare, working hours of the workers, employment of young persons and leave to be granted to workers and that, therefore, the legislature could not have intended to discriminate between the workers who are engaged in a manufacturing process in a building and those who 'are engaged in such a process on open land. It is contended for the appellant that the various provisions of the Act cannot be applicable to salt works where the process of converting sea water into salt is carried on in the open. This is true as regards some of the provisions, but then there is nothing in the Act which makes it uniformly compulsory for every occupier of a factory to comply with every requirement of the Act, An occupier is to comply with such provisions of the Act which apply to the factory he is working. It is admitted that the workers have at times to work at night; that some women workers are employed; that workers have to take rest; that they have to take food at about mid-day; that they do require drinking water and that first-aid 'things are kept in the office room. It may be that the occupier has made adequate arrangements for such purposes but this does not mean that the provisions of the Act concerning such amenities shall not be applicable to salt works. Further, the Act has sufficient provisions empowering the State to exempt the occupiers from complying with certain I provisions as a special case.
Section 6 of the Act empowers the State Government to make rules requiring the previous permission in writing of the State Government or the Chief Inspector to be obtained for the site on which the factory is to be situated and for the construction or extension of any factory or class or description of factories. This provision of the Act together with the relevant rules framed in that connection, does not mean that every factory must have a building and that necessary permission for its construction or extension is to be obtained. Of course, every factory must have a site and previous permission of the State Government or the Chief Inspector may be necessary before the site is to be used for the purposes of a factory.
Further, there is nothing in the definition of manufacturing process " which would make it necessary that this process be carried on in a building. This definition really deals with the nature of the work done and not with where that work is to be done. The work can be done both in the building or in the open.
air, the only buildings being sheds, was not a "factory" within the meaning of 30 & 31 Viet. c. 103 (Factory Acts Extension Act, 1867), s. 3, sub-s. 7. Cockburn, C.J., said at page 23:
This indicates that is premises " need not consist of buildings and that they mean something different from buildings The Act of 1850 was for the regulation of the employment of children in factories and provided that that Act would be construed together with the previous Acts as one Act. There is nothing particular in the Factory Act of 1856 to refer to.
The Act of 1860 dealt with the employment of women, young persons and children in bleaching works and dyeing works under the regulations of the Factories Act; s. VII, which defines the words " Bleaching Works " and " Dyeing Works "
It is clear from the series of legislation up to the decision in Kent's case that the Parliament specifically enacted with respect to the places which were to be controlled by the respective Factory Acts and that it was therefore that it was said that if the legislature had intended to apply the Factory Act to the slate quarries, it would have extended the Act to them. As the various Factories and Mills which were covered by the Factory Act of 1833 were such which could function only in buildings, the conception grew that nothing would come within the expression " factory " unless it had a building and unless the Factory Act definitely provided for the application of the Act to it.

do the necessary work for the occupiers of the Salt Works to convert sea water into salt and that no human agency is employed in such conversion. This contention found favour with the trial Court. The High Court, however, did not agree with it and stated:
It is clear therefore that labourers are employed for (i) admitting sea water to the reservoirs by working sluice gates, sometimes at night also, or the pump; (ii) filling crystallizing beds; (iii) watching the density of brine in the crystallizing beds; (iv) seeing that the density does not exceed certain limits and that salts other than sodium chloride (common salt) are not formed; (v) scraping and collecting salt crystals (vi) grading the salt crystals by "
In both the cases of the rags and the seeds the finished article is different from the article in bulk which enters the hereditament, and that is, in our opinion, an adaptation for sale."

In view of the above,, we are of opinion that the appellant's Salt Works do come within the definition of the word ',factory" and that the appellant has been rightly convicted of the offence of working the factory without obtaining a licence. We therefore dismiss the appeal.
Appeal dismissed.	Conclusion

This definition really deals with the nature of the work done and not with where that work is to be done. The work can be done both in the building or in the open.
Lastly, learned counsel for the appellant relied on certain cases which are detailed below:
air, the only buildings being sheds, was not a "factory" within the meaning of 30 & 31 Viet. c. 103 (Factory Acts Extension Act, 1867), s. 3, sub-s. 7. Cockburn, C.J., said at page 23:

The next case relied on is Redgrave v. Lee (2 ). The earlier decision was just followed in this.
The next case cited for the appellant is Nash v. Hollin shead (3). This case too is distinguishable as the farm on which the workman was employed to drive a movable steam engine for the purpose of working a (1) (1869) L.R. 5 Q.B. 19. (2) (1874) 9 Q.B. 363. (3) [1901] 1 K.B. 700.
mill for grinding meal intended to be used for food for stock on the farm and not for sale, was held to be not a factory in view of the fact that the meal which was ground was not intended for the purpose of sale but was meant only for feeding the stock from the farm. It was also observed that the consequences of holding a farm to be a factory "

The second contention for the appellant is that the process of converting sea water into salt does not amount to "

inasmuch as salt can be said to have been manufactured from sea water by the process of treatment and adaptation of sea water into salt. The sea water, a non-commercial article, has been adapted to salt, a commercial article. The observations in Sedgwick v.

In both the cases of the rags and the seeds the finished article is different from the article in bulk which enters the hereditament, and that is, in our opinion, an adaptation for sale."
In The State of Kerala v. V. M. Patel (1) this Court held the treatment of pepper and ginger to be a " manufacturing process " where the work which was carried on in the premises of the firm was described thus :"

distinguishable as sorting of rags brought about no change in particular rags sorted out. They were just separated from other things with which they were mixed and therefore the rags were in no way adapted to some different article. This cannot be said in connection with the conversion of sea water into salt.
The decisions in McNicol v. Pinch (1), State v. Chrestien Mica Industries Ltd. (2) and G. R. Kulkarni v. The State (3) are of no help in determining the point under consideration as there the word " manufacture " was interpreted according to the dictionary meaning and the context. In the present case, we are considering the definition of the expression "
in connection with the manufacture of salt. The Deputy Commissioner for Salt was not satisfied with this view and in his reply dated September 13, 1952, stated, after referring to the provisions of cl. (m) of s. 2 of the Act, that " by premises is meant building and its adjuncts ". No further correspondence between these authorities has been brought on the record and we do not know what had been the final view taken by the authorities in this connection. Further, such a view expressed by any authority is of no help in deciding the questions before us. It may also be mentioned that the representation made by the President of the Salt Merchants and Shilotires Association on July 12, 1949, to the Secretary to Government of India, Department of Industries & Supply, did not raise the contention that the salt works did not come within the definition of the word " factory " and merely represented that the provisions of the Act be not applied to the salt works in view of the matters mentioned in that representation. Even the reply by the appellant's firm to the Inspector of Factories dated April 9, 1952, did not state that the salt works did not come within the definition of the word " factory " and simply stated that the provisions of the Indian Factories Act were considered redundant for which their Bombay Salt Association had already made a suitable representation to the Government of India. It was for the first time, in the written statement filed by the appellant in the trial Court, that it was contended that the Salt Works would not come within the word " factory " in the Act. Omission of the accused or the Association of salt merchants to contend, at an earlier stage, that the salt works do not come within the definition of the word " factory " is also not of any relevance for our considering the questions before us. We have made reference to it only in view of the reference made by the appellants to an opinion expressed by the Chief Inspector of Factories in his letter to the Deputy Salt Commissioner dated September 13, 1952.
In view of the above,, we are of opinion that the appellant's Salt Works do come within the definition of the word ',factory" and that the appellant has been rightly convicted of the offence of working the factory without obtaining a licence. We therefore dismiss the appeal.
Appeal dismissed.	Total Judgement
