Bhikaji Keshao Joshi And Another vs Brijlal Nandlal Biyani And Others on 2 May, 1955	Case Title
CIVIL APPELLATE, JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 158 of 1954.
Before dealing with the merits of the appeal, it may be mentioned that at an early stage of these proceedings before the Tribunal, an objection was taken to the composition of the Tribunal on the allegation that one of the Members, Shri A. S. Athalye was not competent to be a Member thereof on account of his alleged bias in favour of the first respondent. The bias was sought to be made out by showing that shortly before the election, Shri Athalye had written a letter to the 1st respondent offering to assist him in his election campaign. On objection being taken, the Tribunal stayed its hands for a preliminary decision of that question. Meanwhile, the petitioners took proceedings in the High Court for the quashing of the constitution of the Tribunal on the above ground by means of an application under article 226 of the Constitution. That application was dismissed after hearing both sides. Thereupon the petitioners moved this Court for special leave against the order of the High Court. But this Court declined to grant leave. Learned counsel for the appellants attempted to attack the validity of the decision of the Tribunal now under appeal on the same ground. But this having been already determined against the petitioners in the previous proceedings, we declined to allow the matter to be reopened. On the other side, the learned Attorney-General for the 1st respondent attempted to reopen before us the question as to whether the petition was presented to the Election Commission by an authorised person, which as stated above, was found against him by a majority of the Tribunal. The ground on which he attempted to reopen this question was that the finding was based on a wrong view as to the burden of proof. We were not prepared, however, to permit this finding of fact to be reopened in this appeal on special leave, irrespective of the question whether the burden of proof was rightly laid on the petitioners. The only points, therefore, that have been argued before us are whether the view taken by the Tribunal with reference to the following questions, viz. (1) limitation, (2) joinder of parties, (3) verification, and (4) specification of particulars of corrupt practices in Schedule A attached to the petition, is correct, and if so, whether the same entailed dismissal of the petition. The questions may be taken up one after the other.
3. Respondent No. 1 caused groups and sections of castes and communities, such as Bohara, Lohars, Marwaries, Muslims, Rajasthanies, Bhangies, to issue appeals stating that resolutions were passed for voting for respondent No. 1, coercing the voters by threats, etc., to vote for respondent No. 1 and openly canvassing on communal and caste lines and using undue influence.	Issue
M. C. Setalvad, Attorney-General for India (.ill. N. Phadke and Naunit Lal, with him), for respondent No. 1. 1955. May 2. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by JAGANNADHADAS J.-This is an appeal by special leave against the Judgment and order of the Election Tribunal, Akola, Madhya Pradesh, dated the 1st May, 1953, dismissing the election petition filed by the appellants. It relates to the election for the Akola Constituency of the State Assembly of Madhya Pradesh which was held on the 13th December, 1951, and the result of which was notified in the Gazette on the 4th April, 1952. The two appellants are the electors of the said constituency. The first respondent was the successful candidate at the election. Respondents, Nos. 2, 3 and 4 were the other three candidates who, having been validly nominated went to the polls but were defeated. The appellants filed the election Petition under section 80 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (Act XLIII of 1951) (hereinafter referred to as the Act' for setting aside the election on various allegations. The petition was filed on the 19th April, 1952, before the Election Commission at Delhi and was admittedly one day beyond the prescribed time. The Election Commission admitted the petition after condoning the delay under the proviso to section 85 of the Act and thereupon constituted a Tribunal for the trial of the petition at Akola by notifications dated the 30th July, 1952, and 22nd September- 1952. In due course respondent No. I appeared and filed his written statement on the 6th October, 1952, and the petitioners filed their reply thereto on the 16th October, 1952. With reference to these pleadings, the Tribunal was of the opinion that it was advisable to frame certain preliminary issues and to dispose of the same before entering on the trial of the case on its merits. Accordingly, nine pre- liminary issues were framed. These nine issues sub- stantiaily cover the following questions: (1) Whether the election petition was presented by a properly authorised person. (2) Whether there was sufficient cause for presentation of the petition one day out of time. (3) Whether the petition was defective for non-joinder of certain parties as respondents. (4) Whether the petition is defective for want of proper verification. (5) Whether the petition was defective for vagueness of the particulars relating to the corrupt practices set out in Schedule A thereto. The Tribunal found only the first of the above points in favour of the petitioners by a majority. But in respect of the other four points, it held against the petitioners unanimously. As a result of the adverse findings on these four points, the petition was dismissed without any trial on the merits. It is against this dismissal that the appellants have now come up to this Court on obtaining special leave.
LIMITATION:As stated above, the petition was filed on the 19th April, 1952, admittedly one day beyond time. On the 28th April, 1952, the petitioners filed also an application for condonation of delay setting out the reasons for the same. In paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 thereof the circumstances under which the delay is said to have occurred were set out as follows:
5. Mr. Gole caused the deposit of Rs. 1,000 security for costs to be made in the Government Treasury at Nagpur through Mr. Sidhaye, Advocate, Nagpur, and obtained the necessary Government Treasury receipt on the 18th April, 1952. He then made enquiries about the officer who may have been appointed to receive the election petitions. He con- sulted R. S. Rangole, who was attached to the Election Office at Nagpur. On enquiries Shri Gole learnt that there was none at Nagpur, who was authorised to receive election petition under the Act. Under these circumstances Shri Gole booked a seat in the Night Plane for Delhi and flew to Delhi on the 18th and reached there on the morning on 19th April, 1952. On 19th April Shri Gole caused the petition to be presented to the Secretary to the Election Commission". The explanation thus furnished was accepted by the Election Commission as appears from the intimation to the petitioners by letter dated the 30th July, 1952. The Tribunal was of the opinion that notwithstanding the order of the Election Commission condoning the delay and admitting the petition, it was free to reconsider the question by virtue of the powers vested in it under section 90(4) of the Act. In this view it went into the merits of the explanation furnished and came to the conclusion that the petitioners were negligent and that the delay, even of one day, could not be condoned. It accordingly held that the petition was liable to be dismissed as barred by time. Now, apart from the merits of the sufficiency of the cause for delay, the question as to whether, notwithstanding the condonation of the delay by the Election Commission., it was open to a Tribunal to reconsider the matter by virtue of section 90(4) of the Act, is now covered by the decision of this Court reported in Dinabandhu v. Jadumoni(1). It was therein held that it was not open to the Tribunal to reconsider the matter in such a case. The conclusion of the Tribunal, therefore, on this point cannot be maintained. The learned Attorney-General attempted to argue that the decision of this Court referred to above was obiter as regards the legal point and required further consideration. But we were not prepared to permit that question to be reopened. We were also not satisfied that there was any adequate reason for the Tribunal to interfere with the view taken by the Election Commission condoning the delay of one day on the explanation furnished to it. This explanation has not been found, even by the Tribunal, to be false.
JOINDER OF PARTIES: The objection as to joinder of parties arises as follows. Three persons by name Shri Sohoni, Shri Kulkarni, and Shri Kothkar were nominated as candidates at the election. Their nominations were found to be in order on scrutiny by the Returning Officer. But within the time allowed, these three withdrew from the elections under section 37 of the Act. The petitioners, while they impleaded as respondents the three unsuccessful candidates who went to the polls, did not implead these three persons. The view taken by the Tribunal was that these were also necessary parties and that their non-joinder rendered the petition liable for (1) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 140.	Facts
Veda Vyas, (S. K. Kapur and Ganpat Rai, with him), for the appellants.
It has been argued before us that this view is erroneous and that persons who filed their nominations and who withdrew from the contest within the prescribed time in spite of their nominations having been found to be in order on scrutiny by the Returning Officer, cannot be said to fall within the category of "candidates duly nominated at the election". In support of this contention two decisions Sitaram v. Yograjsing(1) and Sheo Kumar v. V. G. Oak(2) have been cited. On the other side the case in Mohammad Umair v. Ram Charan Singh(3) was brought to our notice in support of the view taken by the Tribunal. These three decisions have treated the decision of the question as depending on a construction of the phrase "at the election" in section 82 of the Act. The Bombay and Allahabad cases hold that this phrase confines the necessary parties under this section to those who were candidates for the actual poll, while the Patna High Court takes the view that the phrase "at the election" has no such limiting significance. It appears to us to be unnecessary and academic to go into this judicial controversy having regard to the decision of this Court in Jagan Nath v. Jaswant Singh(4). If we were called upon to settle this controversy, we would prefer to base the decision not on any meticulous construction of the phrase "at the election" but on a comprehensive consideration of the relevant provisions of the Act and of the rules framed thereunder and of the purpose, if any, of the requirement under section 82 as to the joinder of parties other than the returned candidate. We are, however, relieved from this, since it has been decided in Jagan Nath v. Jaswant Singh(4) that even if any of the necessary parties other than the returned candidate has not been (1) A.I.R. 1953 Bombay 293.
(a),I (b), I (c), I (d), 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 and not others. He accordingly contended that, by implication, the Tribunal was not prepared to hold that items mentioned in paragraphs 1, 3, 9 and 10 were vague. He urged that at least these four items' must be taken not to be vague and that there is no reason why the petitioners should not have been called upon to amend the schedule by furnishing better particulars as to the rest. He further urged that, at any rate, they were entitled to a trial in respect of those four items of corrupt practices. We cannot agree with learned counsel for the appellants that the items set out in paragraphs 3, 9 and 10 are not vague. There is no specification therein of the requisite details which the Act in terms requires. Section 83(2) requires not only what may reasonably be considered "full particulars" having regard to the nature of each allegation, but enjoins in terms that the following particulars should also be given. (1) Names of the parties alleged to have committed the corrupt or illegal practice. (2) The date of the commission of each such corrupt or illegal practice. (3) The place of commission of each such corrupt or illegal practice. There can be no reasonable doubt that the -requirement of "full particulars" is one that has got to be complied with, with sufficient fullness and clarification so as to enable the opposite-party fairly to meet them and that they must be such as not to turn the enquiry before the Tribunal into a rambling and roving inquisition. On a careful scrutiny of the list, in Schedule A we are satisfied that none of the items except that which is set out in paragraph I of item No. I can be said to comply with the requirements of section 83(2). In this view of the contents of Schedule A, the contention of the learned counsel for the appellants is that even so the Tribunal should have called upon the petitioners to furnish better particulars as regards all the other items, by virtue of the ,powers conferred on it under section 83(3), and in the alternative, it should have at least called upon them to substantiate the allegation in paragraph 1 in item No. 1, which was sufficiently specific and which, if made out, might have resulted in the election being set aside. On the question whether or not the Tribunal should have called upon the petitioners to amend the schedule by furnishing better particulars, the learned Attorney-General for the 1st respondent has invited our attention to the objection taken in the written statement as regards the vagueness of the particulars and to the various orders made by the Tribunal as appears from the order-sheet of the case. In the written statement of the 1st respondent paragraph 9 is as follows:
On the 29th January, 1953, the order is "The petitioners do not want to amend their pleadings in view of the amendment of the written statement". In view of the specific objection taken in the written statement and the opportunities which the petitioners had for amending the petition which the above orders disclose, there is considerable force in the contention of the learned Attorney-General that the petitioners, for some reasons best known to themselves, have come forward with a somewhat irresponsible petition and that while the Court has undoubtedly the power to permit amendment of the schedule of corrupt practices by permitting the furnishing of better particulars as regards the items therein specified, there was no duty cast upon the Tribunal to direct suo motu the furnishing of better particulars. It is true that the petitioners in the reply that they filed to the written statement of the 1st respondent and in answer to the objection that the particulars as to the alleged corrupt practices were vague, said as follows:	PetArg

dismissal. In support of their view, the Tribunal relied upon section 82 of the Act which is as follows:
" SCHEDULE "A".
(a) Donation to Hkariharpeth Akhada;
4. Issuing pamphlets and handbills without names of printer or publisher.
On the 17th January, 1953, the Tribunal passed the following order:	Precedent
1,000 for being deposited in the Government Treasury at Nagpur as required by section 117 of the Act and to obtain Treasury receipt for security of costs to be filed with the petition. The applicants were under the belief that an officer must have been appointed by the Election Commission under section 81 of the Act to whom election petitions could be represented for the State of Madhya Pradesh at Nagpur. Accordingly Shri Gole left Akola for Nagpur by the 1 Down Nagpur Mail, reaching Nagpur at about 9-30 A.M. on 18th April, 1952.

(2) A.I.R. 1953 All. 633.
(4) [1954] S.C.R. 892.
VERIFICATION:The view taken by the Tribunal on this question is based on section 83(1) of the Act which is as follows:
The relevant provision in the Civil Procedure Code referred to herein is Order VI, rule 15, clauses (2) and (3), which are as follows:
The objection is that the particulars of the instances furnished in Schedule A to the petition are all of them vague and not in compliance with the above provision. The list of particulars is as follows:
(c) Donation to Bhaji Bazar Association.
(d) Distribution of blankets and Saries and money to voters.
ing of sections 123, 124 and 125 of the Act, and are not allegations of a general character which do not implicate the candidate personally.	Section
impleaded, the petition is not liable to be dismissed in limine on that sole ground but that it is a matter to be taken into consideration at the appropriate stage with reference to the final result of the case. In view of this ruling the decision of the Tribunal on this point also cannot be maintained.
List of particulars of instances referred in the accompanying petition.
lants invited our attention to the fact that the Tribunal, while considering the question of vagueness dealt only with the instances of corrupt practices specified in paragraphs I
(e) It is for the petitioners to satisfy the Election Commission and the Tribunal that the particulars given are according to law. This has not been done and the petition, therefore, ought to be dismissed on this ground". Now the order-sheet of the proceedings before the Tribunal discloses the following. By order dated the 16th October, 1952, the Tribunal decided that the case was in the first instance to be taken up for decision on the preliminary issues. Having so decided it passed the following order:
The case will, therefore, go back for enquiry and trial with reference only to (1) the allegations in paragraphs 6(a), (b) and (c) of the application for setting aside the election, and (2) the allegations in paragraph 1 of item 1, in Schedule A attached to the application as set out above. The Election Commissioner will now reconstitute an appropriate Tribunal for the purpose. The Tribunal when constituted and before proceeding to trial will call upon the petitioners to rectify the lacuna as to dates in the verification clauses in the petition and the schedule. It is to be hoped that the fresh proceedings before the Tribunal will be disposed of at a very early date. The appeal is allowed as stated above but, in the circumstances, without costs.	Conclusion
CIVIL APPELLATE, JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 158 of 1954.
Veda Vyas, (S. K. Kapur and Ganpat Rai, with him), for the appellants.
M. C. Setalvad, Attorney-General for India (.ill. N. Phadke and Naunit Lal, with him), for respondent No. 1. 1955. May 2. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by JAGANNADHADAS J.-This is an appeal by special leave against the Judgment and order of the Election Tribunal, Akola, Madhya Pradesh, dated the 1st May, 1953, dismissing the election petition filed by the appellants. It relates to the election for the Akola Constituency of the State Assembly of Madhya Pradesh which was held on the 13th December, 1951, and the result of which was notified in the Gazette on the 4th April, 1952. The two appellants are the electors of the said constituency. The first respondent was the successful candidate at the election. Respondents, Nos. 2, 3 and 4 were the other three candidates who, having been validly nominated went to the polls but were defeated. The appellants filed the election Petition under section 80 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (Act XLIII of 1951) (hereinafter referred to as the Act' for setting aside the election on various allegations. The petition was filed on the 19th April, 1952, before the Election Commission at Delhi and was admittedly one day beyond the prescribed time. The Election Commission admitted the petition after condoning the delay under the proviso to section 85 of the Act and thereupon constituted a Tribunal for the trial of the petition at Akola by notifications dated the 30th July, 1952, and 22nd September- 1952. In due course respondent No. I appeared and filed his written statement on the 6th October, 1952, and the petitioners filed their reply thereto on the 16th October, 1952. With reference to these pleadings, the Tribunal was of the opinion that it was advisable to frame certain preliminary issues and to dispose of the same before entering on the trial of the case on its merits. Accordingly, nine pre- liminary issues were framed. These nine issues sub- stantiaily cover the following questions: (1) Whether the election petition was presented by a properly authorised person. (2) Whether there was sufficient cause for presentation of the petition one day out of time. (3) Whether the petition was defective for non-joinder of certain parties as respondents. (4) Whether the petition is defective for want of proper verification. (5) Whether the petition was defective for vagueness of the particulars relating to the corrupt practices set out in Schedule A thereto. The Tribunal found only the first of the above points in favour of the petitioners by a majority. But in respect of the other four points, it held against the petitioners unanimously. As a result of the adverse findings on these four points, the petition was dismissed without any trial on the merits. It is against this dismissal that the appellants have now come up to this Court on obtaining special leave.
Before dealing with the merits of the appeal, it may be mentioned that at an early stage of these proceedings before the Tribunal, an objection was taken to the composition of the Tribunal on the allegation that one of the Members, Shri A. S. Athalye was not competent to be a Member thereof on account of his alleged bias in favour of the first respondent. The bias was sought to be made out by showing that shortly before the election, Shri Athalye had written a letter to the 1st respondent offering to assist him in his election campaign. On objection being taken, the Tribunal stayed its hands for a preliminary decision of that question. Meanwhile, the petitioners took proceedings in the High Court for the quashing of the constitution of the Tribunal on the above ground by means of an application under article 226 of the Constitution. That application was dismissed after hearing both sides. Thereupon the petitioners moved this Court for special leave against the order of the High Court. But this Court declined to grant leave. Learned counsel for the appellants attempted to attack the validity of the decision of the Tribunal now under appeal on the same ground. But this having been already determined against the petitioners in the previous proceedings, we declined to allow the matter to be reopened. On the other side, the learned Attorney-General for the 1st respondent attempted to reopen before us the question as to whether the petition was presented to the Election Commission by an authorised person, which as stated above, was found against him by a majority of the Tribunal. The ground on which he attempted to reopen this question was that the finding was based on a wrong view as to the burden of proof. We were not prepared, however, to permit this finding of fact to be reopened in this appeal on special leave, irrespective of the question whether the burden of proof was rightly laid on the petitioners. The only points, therefore, that have been argued before us are whether the view taken by the Tribunal with reference to the following questions, viz. (1) limitation, (2) joinder of parties, (3) verification, and (4) specification of particulars of corrupt practices in Schedule A attached to the petition, is correct, and if so, whether the same entailed dismissal of the petition. The questions may be taken up one after the other.
LIMITATION:As stated above, the petition was filed on the 19th April, 1952, admittedly one day beyond time. On the 28th April, 1952, the petitioners filed also an application for condonation of delay setting out the reasons for the same. In paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 thereof the circumstances under which the delay is said to have occurred were set out as follows:
1,000 for being deposited in the Government Treasury at Nagpur as required by section 117 of the Act and to obtain Treasury receipt for security of costs to be filed with the petition. The applicants were under the belief that an officer must have been appointed by the Election Commission under section 81 of the Act to whom election petitions could be represented for the State of Madhya Pradesh at Nagpur. Accordingly Shri Gole left Akola for Nagpur by the 1 Down Nagpur Mail, reaching Nagpur at about 9-30 A.M. on 18th April, 1952.

Mr. Gole caused the deposit of Rs. 1,000 security for costs to be made in the Government Treasury at Nagpur through Mr. Sidhaye, Advocate, Nagpur, and obtained the necessary Government Treasury receipt on the 18th April, 1952. He then made enquiries about the officer who may have been appointed to receive the election petitions. He con- sulted R. S. Rangole, who was attached to the Election Office at Nagpur. On enquiries Shri Gole learnt that there was none at Nagpur, who was authorised to receive election petition under the Act. Under these circumstances Shri Gole booked a seat in the Night Plane for Delhi and flew to Delhi on the 18th and reached there on the morning on 19th April, 1952. On 19th April Shri Gole caused the petition to be presented to the Secretary to the Election Commission". The explanation thus furnished was accepted by the Election Commission as appears from the intimation to the petitioners by letter dated the 30th July, 1952. The Tribunal was of the opinion that notwithstanding the order of the Election Commission condoning the delay and admitting the petition, it was free to reconsider the question by virtue of the powers vested in it under section 90(4) of the Act. In this view it went into the merits of the explanation furnished and came to the conclusion that the petitioners were negligent and that the delay, even of one day, could not be condoned.

Jadumoni(1). It was therein held that it was not open to the Tribunal to reconsider the matter in such a case. The conclusion of the Tribunal, therefore, on this point cannot be maintained. The learned Attorney-General attempted to argue that the decision of this Court referred to above was obiter as regards the legal point and required further consideration.

We were also not satisfied that there was any adequate reason for the Tribunal to interfere with the view taken by the Election Commission condoning the delay of one day on the explanation furnished to it. This explanation has not been found, even by the Tribunal, to be false.
JOINDER OF PARTIES: The objection as to joinder of parties arises as follows. Three persons by name Shri Sohoni, Shri Kulkarni, and Shri Kothkar were nominated as candidates at the election. Their nominations were found to be in order on scrutiny by the Returning Officer. But within the time allowed, these three withdrew from the elections under section 37 of the Act. The petitioners, while they impleaded as respondents the three unsuccessful candidates who went to the polls, did not implead these three persons. The view taken by the Tribunal was that these were also necessary parties and that their non-joinder rendered the petition liable for (1) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 140.
dismissal. In support of their view, the Tribunal relied upon section 82 of the Act which is as follows:
It has been argued before us that this view is erroneous and that persons who filed their nominations and who withdrew from the contest within the prescribed time in spite of their nominations having been found to be in order on scrutiny by the Returning Officer, cannot be said to fall within the category of "candidates duly nominated at the election".

impleaded, the petition is not liable to be dismissed in limine on that sole ground but that it is a matter to be taken into consideration at the appropriate stage with reference to the final result of the case. In view of this ruling the decision of the Tribunal on this point also cannot be maintained.
VERIFICATION:The view taken by the Tribunal on this question is based on section 83(1) of the Act which is as follows:
The relevant provision in the Civil Procedure Code referred to herein is Order VI, rule 15, clauses (2) and (3), which are as follows:
In the present case the verification of the petition as well as the schedule of particulars of corrupt practices are each signed by both the petitioners and there is now no dispute about it. The verification clause in the petition is as follows:
The objection is that the particulars of the instances furnished in Schedule A to the petition are all of them vague and not in compliance with the above provision. The list of particulars is as follows:
" SCHEDULE "A".
List of particulars of instances referred in the accompanying petition.
1. That in the month of December, 1951, respondent No. 1 has been to the premises of Akola Shree Gurudwara, where the Local Sikh Community had assembled to listen to the recitation of the holy book 'Granth Saheb' on the 7th day of the death of daughter of one Sardar. Suratsingb. At this meeting respondent No. 1 canvassed for votes for himself and paid Rs. 201/-, apparently as donation to the Gurudwara, but really as gift for inducing the Sikh Community in the Akola Constituency in general and the Sikhs assembled in particular to induce them to vote for himself at the ensuing election. Respondent No. 1 was guilty of bribery within the meaning of that term in section 123 of the Representation of the People Act.' Similar instances of giving illegal gratifications for securing votes of respective groups are-
(a) Donation to Hkariharpeth Akhada;
(b) Payment to Panch-bungalow Committee of Bhangis of Old City.
(c) Donation to Bhaji Bazar Association.
(d) Distribution of blankets and Saries and money to voters.
2. At the instance of respondent No. I a meeting of workers in Berar Oil Industries a concern of Birla, was called by its manager on the eve of the election and they were threatened to vote for respondent No. 1 on pain of losing their service or suffer pecuniary loss, in case they did not vote for respondent No. 1. The poster of the rival candidate affixed on the post-office within the premises of the Berar Oil Industries was removed and stolen away.
3. Respondent No. 1 caused groups and sections of castes and communities, such as Bohara, Lohars, Marwaries, Muslims, Rajasthanies, Bhangies, to issue appeals stating that resolutions were passed for voting for respondent No. 1, coercing the voters by threats, etc., to vote for respondent No. 1 and openly canvassing on communal and caste lines and using undue influence.
4. Issuing pamphlets and handbills without names of printer or publisher.
5. At the time of counting votes in Polling Station No. 53, several folded bundles amounting to about 20 in number, of ballot papers were found in the ballot box of respondent No. 1, when it was opened for counting votes. This was noted by the Returning Officer. Each bundle consisted three or more than three ballot papers, folded together. Obviously each of the bundle of these ballot papers were put in the ballot box by one person, as the ballot papers put in the ballot box by different voters could not automatically fold themselves into a compact bundle in the ballot box. The ballot papers issued to voters were not put in the box by the voters themselves, but were illegally brought back by the voters and handed over to persons working for and on behalf of respondent No. I on payment of illegal gratification. These ballot papers thus collected were bundled together and put in the ballot box by persons working for and on behalf of respondent No. 1 by taking illegal gratifications. This was done on 31st December, 1951, at Chandur by persons with the connivance of respondent No. 1.
6. False personation of several dead voters and voters absent in Pakistan has taken place in Ward No. 12 and 15.
7. The respondent No. 1 resorted to false propaganda. His man announced on loud speakers from place to place that rival candidate Dr. Joglekar was of the caste and party of Godse, the murderer of M. Gandhi and a vote for him was a vote for Gandhi's Murderer. Another false propaganda was that Dr. Joglekar was Mishra's man, supported by Mishra's money. Lectures for respondent No. 1 in public meetings, including respondent No. I have freely made these false defamatory and malicious statements against Dr. Joglekar, the rival candidate and thus prejudiced the prospects of Dr. Joglekar's election. Personal character and conduct of Dr. Joglekar was also falsely attached, thus prejudicing his prospects of election.
8. Voters were carried in hired carts at many polling stations, particularly at Kapshi Polling Station. This was arranged by persons working for and on behalf of respondent No. I at his expense and connivance. A written objection for police enquiry was given at Kapshi and one in Rifle Range area.
9. Respondent No. 1 spent lacs of rupees over his election transgressing the prescribed limit of Rs. 6,000. He has given a totally untrue return of election expenses. This is in contravention of law.
10. Mohota Mills released workers and paid them for canvassing work for respondent No. 1 on polling day. Substitutes for these workers were engaged by the mills and they were also paid. This was done at the instance of respondent No. I".
There can be no doubt that almost all the instances herein- above set out are extremely vague and lack sufficient particulars. Learned counsel for the appel-
lants invited our attention to the fact that the Tribunal, while considering the question of vagueness dealt only with the instances of corrupt practices specified in paragraphs I
(a),I (b), I (c), I (d), 2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 and not others. He accordingly contended that, by implication, the Tribunal was not prepared to hold that items mentioned in paragraphs 1, 3, 9 and 10 were vague. He urged that at least these four items' must be taken not to be vague and that there is no reason why the petitioners should not have been called upon to amend the schedule by furnishing better particulars as to the rest. He further urged that, at any rate, they were entitled to a trial in respect of those four items of corrupt practices. We cannot agree with learned counsel for the appellants that the items set out in paragraphs 3, 9 and 10 are not vague. There is no specification therein of the requisite details which the Act in terms requires. Section 83(2) requires not only what may reasonably be considered "full particulars" having regard to the nature of each allegation, but enjoins in terms that the following particulars should also be given. (1) Names of the parties alleged to have committed the corrupt or illegal practice. (2) The date of the commission of each such corrupt or illegal practice. (3) The place of commission of each such corrupt or illegal practice. There can be no reasonable doubt that the -requirement of "full particulars" is one that has got to be complied with, with sufficient fullness and clarification so as to enable the opposite-party fairly to meet them and that they must be such as not to turn the enquiry before the Tribunal into a rambling and roving inquisition. On a careful scrutiny of the list, in Schedule A we are satisfied that none of the items except that which is set out in paragraph I of item No. I can be said to comply with the requirements of section 83(2). In this view of the contents of Schedule A, the contention of the learned counsel for the appellants is that even so the Tribunal should have called upon the petitioners to furnish better particulars as regards all the other items, by virtue of the ,powers conferred on it under section 83(3), and in the alternative, it should have at least called upon them to substantiate the allegation in paragraph 1 in item No. 1, which was sufficiently specific and which, if made out, might have resulted in the election being set aside. On the question whether or not the Tribunal should have called upon the petitioners to amend the schedule by furnishing better particulars, the learned Attorney-General for the 1st respondent has invited our attention to the objection taken in the written statement as regards the vagueness of the particulars and to the various orders made by the Tribunal as appears from the order-sheet of the case. In the written statement of the 1st respondent paragraph 9 is as follows:
Similarly the allegation in para 2 is that the coercion was the result of manipulation by ,or at the instance of respondent No. 1. Thus these allegations must be supported by giving the necessary particulars regarding the names, date and place of commission of corrupt or illegal practice alleged. The allegations in paras 1 and 2 of the petition are allegations of corrupt and illegal practice within the mean-
ing of sections 123, 124 and 125 of the Act, and are not allegations of a general character which do not implicate the candidate personally.
(d) Further by way of example, para I of the schedule, no names, date of the alleged practices are given. Same is the case with the allegations in paras 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 & 10.
(e) It is for the petitioners to satisfy the Election Commission and the Tribunal that the particulars given are according to law. This has not been done and the petition, therefore, ought to be dismissed on this ground". Now the order-sheet of the proceedings before the Tribunal discloses the following. By order dated the 16th October, 1952, the Tribunal decided that the case was in the first instance to be taken up for decision on the preliminary issues. Having so decided it passed the following order:
On the 17th January, 1953, the Tribunal passed the following order:
On the 27th January, 1953, the order is "The petitioners have filed 'their reply to the amendment application of the respondent No. 1. The latter has amended his application, to which there was no objection".
On the 29th January, 1953, the order is "The petitioners do not want to amend their pleadings in view of the amendment of the written statement". In view of the specific objection taken in the written statement and the opportunities which the petitioners had for amending the petition which the above orders disclose, there is considerable force in the contention of the learned Attorney-General that the petitioners, for some reasons best known to themselves, have come forward with a somewhat irresponsible petition and that while the Court has undoubtedly the power to permit amendment of the schedule of corrupt practices by permitting the furnishing of better particulars as regards the items therein specified, there was no duty cast upon the Tribunal to direct suo motu the furnishing of better particulars. It is true that the petitioners in the reply that they filed to the written statement of the 1st respondent and in answer to the objection that the particulars as to the alleged corrupt practices were vague, said as follows:
That the respondent No. 1 is disqualified to fill the seat under the Act., because he is the Managing Agent or Managing Director of Rajasthan Printing and Litho Works -private limited company under the Indian Companies Act. He has, as a share-holder and director, interest, in contracts for supply of goods, viz. stationery, paper and printing materials, etc., to the State Government of Madhya Pradesh. He has also interest in contracts for the execution of works or performance of services, such as printing, etc., under- taken by the State Government of Madhya Pradesh. The respondent No. 1 gets a share by way of commission on sales effected by the Limited Company. He has, therefore, by himself interest in the contracts of the company with the State Government of Madhya Pradesh.
(b)The respondent No. 1 is a partner in the firm Berar 'General Agency. The said firm has entered into a contract for the performance of cloth distribution on behalf of the State Government to retailers and holds a licence for the same. The respondent No. 1, therefore, has interest by himself in the said contract for the performance of services undertaken by the Government.
(c)The respondent No. 1 is the proprietor of the monthly Journal "Prawaha" and a by-weekly paper "Matru-bhumi". These publications print Government advertisements on contract basis. The respondent No. 1 has, therefore, interest in the said contract for the performance of services undertaken by the State Government Madhya Pradesh. The income derived from these contracts by the respondent No. 1 are noted in the private accounts of the respondent No. 1 and their details are shown in the profit and loss statements filed with income-tax return of the respondent No. I for the relevant year and current year. The sales and other details of the "Matru-bhumi" concern are noted in the private accounts of the respondent No. 1. These objections were summarily overruled by the Returning Officer, without any inquiry or any reason'' These allegations, if made out with such further details as may be necessary, might well prove serious and bring about the setting aside of the election of the returned candidate. The 1st respondent in answer to these allegations states as follows:
Having regard to the nature of the alleged disqualifi- cation, which is substantially to the effect that the returned candidate had interest in contracts with the Government at the relevant dates, it was very necessary that the matters should have been cleared up in the enquiry before the Election Tribunal. It is not in the interest of purity of elections that such allegations of disqualification should be completely ignored without enquiry and it appears rather surprising that the Tribunal should have ignored them and exercised its power to dismiss the petition. However reluctant we might be to interfere in a matter like this after the lapse of three years and four months and with only an year and eight months before the general elections, we feel constrained to send this matter back for due enquiry. But before doing so and in view of the delay and other circumstances that have already happened, we, in exercise of the powers which the Tribunal in the normal course might itself have exercised, direct the striking out of all the items of alleged corrupt practices set out in Schedule A excepting the one covered by paragraph I of item 1, i.e., as follows:
The case will, therefore, go back for enquiry and trial with reference only to (1) the allegations in paragraphs 6(a), (b) and (c) of the application for setting aside the election, and (2) the allegations in paragraph 1 of item 1, in Schedule A attached to the application as set out above. The Election Commissioner will now reconstitute an appropriate Tribunal for the purpose. The Tribunal when constituted and before proceeding to trial will call upon the petitioners to rectify the lacuna as to dates in the verification clauses in the petition and the schedule. It is to be hoped that the fresh proceedings before the Tribunal will be disposed of at a very early date. The appeal is allowed as stated above but, in the circumstances, without costs.
