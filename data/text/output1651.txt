Issue
Bakshi Man Singh and Sardar Singh, for the respondents. 1960. April 20. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by WANCHOO, J.-This is an appeal by special leave against the judgment of the Punjab High Court. The brief facts necessary for present purposes are these. The appellant had executed two usufructuary mortgages with respect to two properties situate in Ferozepore city in favour of the respondents in 1946. She also took both properties on lease on the same date. An application was filed by the respondents under s. 13 of the Displaced Persons (Debts Adjustment) Act, No. LXX of 1951 (hereinafter called the Act), for recovery of the principal sum due as well as the rent which was said to be in arrears. The application was resisted by the appellant on various grounds, one of which was that no such application lay as the liability was not a debt under the Act. The tribunal negatived the contention of the appellant and passed a preliminary decree for sale. Six months' time was allowed to the appellant to pay the decretal amount, failing which the respondents were at liberty to get a final decree prepared and bring the properties to sale. The appellant went in appeal to the High Court but the appeal was dismissed. Then there was a Letters Patent Appeal, which was also dismissed. The appel- lant then applied for and was granted special leave by this Court, and that is how the matter has come up before us. The only point for our consideration is whether the liability created under a mortgage is a debt within the meaning of s. 2(6) of the Act. The relevant part of that provision runs as follows:-	Facts
Y. Kumar, for the appellant.	PetArg
Debt is defined in s. 2(6) as meaning any pecuniary liability and has been restricted by the three subclauses in the sub-section with reference to the person who might be owing the debt or to whom the debt might be owed. Sub-cls.
(a) and (b) refer to the debts owed by a displaced person as defined in the Act while sub-cl. (c) refers to a debt due to a displaced person. Sub-cl. (c) has therefore to be taken independently of sub-cls. (a) and (b), for it refers to a creditor who is a displaced person while the other two sub- clauses refer to a debtor who is a displaced person. Under subcl. (c) a displaced person who is a creditor can recover the debt due to him from any other person, whether a displaced person or not, who is residing in the territories to which the Act extends. The main contention of the appellant in this connection is that a mortgage debt is not a pecuniary liability and therefore does not fall within the definition of debt at all. We are of opinion that there is no force in this contention. The words " pecuniary liability " will cover any liability which is of a monetary nature. Now the definition of a mortgage in s. 58 of the Transfer of Property Act, No. 4 of 1882, shows that though it is the transfer of an interest in specific immovable property, the purpose of the transfer is to secure the payment of money advanced or to be advanced by way of loan or to secure an existing or future debt or the performance of an engagement which may give rise to a pecuniary liability. The money advanced by way of loan, for example, which is secured by a mortgage, obviously creates a pecuniary liability. It is true that a mortgage in addition to creating the pecuniary liability also transfers interest in the specific immovable property to secure that liability ; none the less the loan or debt to secure which the mortgage is created will remain a pecuniary liability of the person creating the mortgage. Therefore a mortgage debt would create a pecuniary liability upon the mortgagor and would be covered by the definition of the word "debt" in s. 2(6). We may in this connection refer to the Displaced Persons (Institution of Suits) Act, No. XLVII of 1948, which has been practically repealed by the Act. In that law, suits relating to immovable property were specially excepted under s. 4, but there is no such provision in the Act. Again s. 6 of the Displaced Persons (Legal Proceedings) Act, No. XXV of 1949, which has also been repealed by the Act mentions decrees or orders for payment of money while in s. 15 of the Act which deals with the same matter those words are omitted and the words "
2 (6) (c) empowers a displaced creditor to make an application under s. 13 even with respect to a mortgage debt, there will be hardship to prior mortgagees or subsequent mortgagees inasmuch as these persons cannot be dealt with under the Act. Section 13 empowers a displaced person claiming a debt from any other person who is not a displaced person to apply within one year of the coming into force of the Act in any local area to the tribunal having jurisdiction in the matter. The provision is obviously enacted to give relief for a short period only. Section 25 of the Act provides for the regulation of all proceedings under the Act by the provisions contained in the Code of Civil Procedure save as expressly provided in the Act or in any rules made thereunder. But assuming that in spite of this provision, 0. XXXIV, r. 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure will not apply to proceedings under the Act and all those having an interest in the mortgage security cannot be joined as parties as required by 0. XXXIV, r. 1, the interest of prior or puisne mortgagees cannot in any case be affected by the decree passed under the Act. The Explanation to 0. XXXIV, r. 1, shows that a prior mortgagee need not be made a party to a suit for sale by a puisne mortgagee. So far therefore as a prior mortgagee is con- cerned, his rights will not be affected by the decree passed under s. 13 of the Act, just as his rights are not affected by the decree passed under 0. XXXIV. So far as mortgagees subsequent to the displaced creditor who applies under s. 13 are concerned, their interests will also not be jeopardized by the decree which may be passed under s. 13. Even under
0. XXXIV, which requires puisne or subsequent mortgagees to be joined as parties in a suit for sale, a decree obtained in a suit to which the subsequent mortgagee was not joined as a party does not affect his rights and the proceedings in such a suit are not binding on him so as to affect his rights under the second mortgage. He can thus follow the property by suing his mortgagor, even though it may have been sold under the decree of an earlier mortgagee in a suit to which he was not a party. Therefore, the interest of the prior mortgagee or the subsequent mortgagee, if any, would not be affected by a decree passed on an application under s. 13 and there is no reason therefore to cut down the plain meaning of the words used in s. 2 (6) (c) on the ground that the proceedings under the Act would prejudicially affect the rights of prior or puisne mortgagees.	Section
There is therefore no force in this appeal and it is hereby dismissed with costs.
Appeal dismissed.	Conclusion
