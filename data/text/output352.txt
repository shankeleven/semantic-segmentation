shares held by them. These persons may hold the shares as trustees and may even be accountable to their beneficiaries and may be brought to book for exercising their votes in breach of trust, nevertheless, as between them as shareholders and the company, they are the shareholders, and as such, have "a controlling interest" in the company. [See Inland Revenue Commissioners v. J. Bibby & Sons Ltd.(1) and Commissioner of Income-tax v. Bipin Silk Mills Ltd. (2)]. According to the facts found in the statement of the case the directors of the respondent company do not themselves hold the majority of shares which, on the contrary, are registered in the name of the Aluminium Ltd. and, therefore, according to the principles discussed above, they cannot be said to have "a controlling interest" in the respondent company.
Learned counsel for the respondent company, however, contends, on the analogy of the reasonings adopted by the House of Lords in British American Tobacco Co. Ltd. v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue(3) that although Mr. L. G. Bash does not hold the majority of shares and has no beneficial interest in the shares held by the Aluminium Ltd. in the respondent company and although he may be bound to cast the votes according to the directions of his principals, the Aluminium Ltd., and may be answerable to the latter if he acts in breach of his duty, nevertheless, as long as his authority is not revoked, as far as the respondent company is concerned, tile, majority of its vote- carrying shares are subject, directly or indirectly, to his will and ordering and, therefore, the directors of the respondent company in fact control its affairs at general meetings and as such have " a controlling interest "

appears to us to be apposite. It is unfortunate that the last mentioned case was not brought to the notice of the High Court before the judgment under appeal was delivered. Dissent has been expressed in the judgment under appeal from the recent decision of the Bombay High Court in New Shorrock Spinning and Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay(1). The facts of that case are entirely different from the facts of the case before us and that decision has no manner of application to the present case. It is, therefore, unnecessary for us to discuss or express any opinion as to whether the observations to be found in the judgment in that case are or are not well-founded. For reasons stated above, we accept this appeal and hold that the answer to the question referred by the Appellate Tribunal to the High Court should be in the negative. The respondent company must pay the costs of the appellant in this court as well as in the High Court.

CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 78 of 1952. Appeal from the Judgment and Order dated the 17th January, 1951, of the High Court of Judicature at Calcutta (Harries C.J. and Banerjee J.) in its Special Jurisdiction (Income- tax) in Income-tax Reference No. 50 of 1950.

1953. October 8. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS J.-This is an appeal from the judgment and order of a Bench of the Calcutta High Court delivered on a reference made by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal under section 21 of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940, read with section 66(1) of the Indian Income-tax Act, whereby the High Court answered in the affirmative the question of law referred to it. The question referred was:
The controversy arose between the parties during proceedings for assessment of excess profits tax for five chargeable accounting periods ending on the 31st December of each of the years 1939 to 1943.
The relevant facts which are not in dispute are these: The respondent company is a company incorporated in what was then British India having a capital of Rs. 3,600,000 divided into 360,000 shares of Rs. 10 each. The Aluminium Limited, a company incorporated in Canada, held 359,790 shares in the chargeable accounting periods ending on December31, 1939, and December 31, 1940, and 359,600 shares in the chargeable accounting periods ending on December 31, 1941, December 31, 1942, and December 31, 1943. In exercise of the power given to it by article 105 of the articles of association of the respondent company, the Aluminium Ltd. appointed three permanent directors on the board of directors of the respondent company. Two of these directors eventually retired and only one, namely, Mr. L. G. Bash continued to be a director of the respondent company nominated by the Aluminium Ltd. Mr. L. G. Bash and the other directors had between them during the chargeable accounting periods ending on December 31, 1939, and December 31, 1940, only 210 shares and in the chargeable accounting periods ending on December 31, 1941, December 31, 1942, and December 31, 1943, 400 shares, Mr. L. G. Bash not having a single share during these last mentioned chargeable accounting periods. By a resolution passed by the directors of the Aluminium Ltd., Mr. L. G. Bash was appointed to vote and/or from time to time to appoint a special or general proxy to vote for and on behalf of the Aluminium Ltd. in respect of the shares held by it in the respondent company at all ordinary or extraordinary general meetings of the shareholders of the respondent company. Article 90 of the articles of association of the respondent company provides:-
Mr. L. G. Bash has at all material times been exercising the powers conferred by the above article as the representative of the Aluminium Ltd.
The claim of the respondent company was that it should be regarded as a company the directors whereof had a controlling interest therein, inasmuch as Mr. L. G. Bash, one of the directors, had the I authority to exercise the voting power of the Aluminium Ltd. and, as such, could control the affairs of the respondent company and that in computing the standard profits the statutory percentage should be taken at 10 per cent. per annum and not at 8 per cent per annum. This contention was rejected by the Excess Profits Tax Officer. On appeal by the respondent company the Appellate Assistant Commissioner of Excess Profits Tax upheld the decision of the Excess Profits Tax Officer. The respondent company thereupon appealed to the Incometax Appellate Tribunal "which reversed the decision of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner observing that in view of the power of attorney that was given to Mr. L. G. Bash by the Aluminium Ltd. there was no room for doubt that the respondent company, which was then the appellant before the Tribunal, was a director-controlled company. On the application of the Commissioner of Income-tax, the Appellate Tribunal referred the question of law herein before set out. By its judgment dated the 11th January, 1951, the High Court of Calcutta has answered the question in the affirmative. The Commissioner of Excess Profits Tax, West Bengal, has now come up on appeal to this court with a certificate under section 66-A (2) of the Indian Income-tax Act. In common parlance a person is said to have "a controlling interest" in a company when such a person acquires, by purchase or otherwise, the majority of the vote-carrying shares in that company, for the control of the company resides in the voting powers of its shareholders. In this sense, the directors of a company may well be regarded as having "a controlling interest" in the company when they hold and are entered in the share register as holders of the majority of the shares which, under the articles of association of the company, carry the right to vote. [See Glasgow Expanded Metal Co., Ltd. v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue (1) and Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. B. W. Noble(2)]. It is not, however, necessary that in order to have "a Controlling interest" the person or persons who hold the majority of the votecarrying shares must have a beneficial interest in the (1) (1923) 12 Tax Cas. 573.
(2) (1926) 12 Tax Cas, 911.
shares held by them. These persons may hold the shares as trustees and may even be accountable to their beneficiaries and may be brought to book for exercising their votes in breach of trust, nevertheless, as between them as shareholders and the company, they are the shareholders, and as such, have "a controlling interest" in the company. [See Inland Revenue Commissioners v. J. Bibby & Sons Ltd.(1) and Commissioner of Income-tax v. Bipin Silk Mills Ltd. (2)]. According to the facts found in the statement of the case the directors of the respondent company do not themselves hold the majority of shares which, on the contrary, are registered in the name of the Aluminium Ltd. and, therefore, according to the principles discussed above, they cannot be said to have "a controlling interest" in the respondent company.
Learned counsel for the respondent company, however, contends, on the analogy of the reasonings adopted by the House of Lords in British American Tobacco Co. Ltd. v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue(3) that although Mr. L. G. Bash does not hold the majority of shares and has no beneficial interest in the shares held by the Aluminium Ltd. in the respondent company and although he may be bound to cast the votes according to the directions of his principals, the Aluminium Ltd., and may be answerable to the latter if he acts in breach of his duty, nevertheless, as long as his authority is not revoked, as far as the respondent company is concerned, tile, majority of its vote- carrying shares are subject, directly or indirectly, to his will and ordering and, therefore, the directors of the respondent company in fact control its affairs at general meetings and as such have " a controlling interest "
