Alamgir & Another vs The State Of Bihar on 14 November, 1958	Case Title
CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 187 of 1956.
Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated December 7, 1955, of the Patna High Court in Criminal Revision No. 875 of 1954, arising out of the judgment and order dated May 31, 1954, of the Court of the Additional Sessions Judge at Arrah in Criminal Appeal No. 293 of 1953. B. K. Saran and K. L. Mehta, for the appellants. B. H. Dhebar and T. M. Sen, for the respondent. 1958. November 14. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by GAJENDERAGADKAR, J.-This criminal appeal raises a short question about the construction of the word " detains "	Issue
detains " has been used in s. 498 that is substantially against the construction for which the appellant contends. Section 498 provides:	PetArg
proper control of his wife for the purpose of illicit inter- course is the gist of the offence just as it is the offence of taking away a wife under the same section; and a detention occasioning such deprivation may be brought about simply by the influence of allurement and blandishment. On the facts of the case, however, the court was not satisfied that the accused bad offered any such allurement or blandishment and so the order of conviction passed against the appellant was quashed. It appears that the construction put by the Madras High Court on s. 498 in this case has been generally accepted in the said High Court (Vide: Ramaswamy Udayar v. Raju Udayar (1) ).
The Bombay High Court has taken the same view in Emperor v. Jan Mahomed (2). It was held by the High Court that the offence contemplated by & 498 is complete if it appears that the accused went away with the woman in such a manner as to deprive her husband of the control of his wife; the fact that the woman accompanied the accused of her own free will does not diminish the criminality of the act. Even in this case, the court was unable to discover any evidence, direct or indirect, about the intention of the accused or any allurement or blandishment offered by him and so the order of conviction passed against the accused was set aside. This question came to be considered by the said High Court again in Emperor v. Mahiji Fula (3). Mr. Justice Broomfield who delivered the main judgment of the Bench has expressed the view that " the word I detains ' means, by deprivation, and according to the ordinary use of the language I keeps back"'; and he adds that ,there may be various ways of keeping back. It need not necessarily be by physical force. It may be by persuasion or, as the Court " (Madras High Court) " has observed in this particular case" (Sundara Dass Thevan (4)) " by allurement or blandishment ". On the facts, however, it appeared to the trial court that the conduct of the accused did not bring his case within the mischief of s.
498. The wife of the complainant had been taken (1) A.I.R. (1953) Mad. 333.
(2) (1902) IV Bom. L. R. 435.
(4) (1868) IV Mad. H. C. R. 20.
The Calcutta High Court appears to have put a similar construction on the word "detention". In Prithi Missir v. Harak Nath Singh (3) it has been held by the said High Court that " the word ' detention' is ejusdem generis with enticement and concealment. It does not imply that the woman is being kept against her will but there must be evidence to show that the accused did something which had the effect of preventing the woman from returning to her husband ". On the merits, however, the court held that the learned trial magistrate had not come to any definite finding of fact. In fact it did not appear that the accused was keeping the complainant's wife as his mistress; and on the whole, the court was not satisfied that the accused was responsible for the conduct of the complainant's wife for leaving her husband's house and so detention was held not proved against the accused. In Mabarak Sheikh v. Ahmed Newaz (4) the same High Court held that there can be no detention of a woman within the meaning of s. 498, second part, if the woman is an absolutely free agent to go away from the person charged whenever she likes. It appears that the learned judges were inclined to hold that there could be no detention if the woman was an absolutely free agent to go away from the person charged whenever she likes to do so; and in support of this view they have referred to some of the decisions which we have already considered. With respect, it appears that the effect of the earlier decisions has not been properly considered and the findings of fact recorded in the said decisions are assumed to lend colour to, and modify, the construction of the section (1) (1937) 39 Bom. L.R. 61.
adopted by them. Besides, the relevant observations appear to be obiter because, on the facts, it was found in this case that the woman was not a free agent and so the charge against the accused under s. 498 was held established. In Bipad Bhanjan Sarkar v. Emperor (1), Henderson and Khundkar, JJ., have considered the word " detains " in the same manner as we have done. However, as in many other cases, in this case also, the court found that there was absolutely nothing to show that the accused had done anything which could bring his case within the mischief of s. 498.
The Patna High Court, in Banarsi Raut v. Emperor (2), has held that providing shelter to a married woman is such an inducement as to amount to detention within the meaning of s. 498. This case shows that where a married woman was found living in the house of the accused for some time and sexual intercourse between them had been established, the court was inclined to draw the inference that there was per- suasion or inducement of the woman as would come within the meaning of the word " detention ". This is a case on the other side of the line where on facts the inference was drawn against the accused.
The Lahore High Court has taken a similar view as early as 1913 in Bansi Lal v. The Crown (3 ). The court has held that where the accused had provided a house for the woman where she stayed after deserting her husband under the protection of the accused as his mistress, it was active conduct on his part which was sufficient to bring him within the terms of s. 498. In 1939, however, a Division Bench of the Lahore High Court has taken a contrary view in Harnam Singh v. Emperor (4). In this case the revisional application filed by Harnam Singh against his conviction under s. 498 was first argued before Din Muhammad, J., who referred it to a Division Bench because he thought that the question of law raised was of some importance. In his referring judgment the learned judge mentioned some of the relevant decisions to which his attention was drawn and indicated his own view that (1) I.L.R. [1940] 2 Cal. 93.
the word " detains " would naturally imply some overt act on the part of the person who detains in relation to the person detained. He thought that mere blandishment would not constitute any relevant factor in the matter of detention. The matter was then placed before a Division Bench consisting of Young, C. J., and Blacker, J. Unfortunately the judgment of the Division Bench does not discuss the question of the construction of s. 498 ; it merely records the conclusion of the court in these words: " In our opinion, the word " detains " clearly implies some act on the part of the accused by which the woman's movements are restrained and this again implies unwillingness on her part. Detention cannot include persuasion by means of blandishments or similar inducements which would leave the woman free to go if she wished ". The learned judges also added that they were of the opinion that the word " detains " cannot be reasonably construed as having reference to the husband. In our opinion, these observations do not correctly represent the true purport and effect of the provisions of s. 498.	Precedent

The position, therefore, is that, on the findings of fact made by the lower courts against appellant No. I it must be held that he has been rightly convicted under s. 498. That takes us to the question of sentence imposed on him by the High Court in its revisional jurisdiction. We are satisfied that the High Court was not justified in directing appellant No. I to suffer rigorous imprisonment for six months by way of enhancement of the sentence. It is unnecessary to emphasise that the question of sentence is normally in the discretion of the trial judge. It is for the trial judge to take into account all relevant circumstances and decide what sentence would meet the ends of justice in a given case. The High Court undoubtedly has jurisdiction to enhance such sentence under s. 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure; but this jurisdiction can be properly exercised only if the High Court is satisfied that the sentence imposed by the trial judge is unduly lenient, or, that, in passing the order of sentence, the trial judge had manifestly failed to consider the relevant facts. It may be that the High Court thought that the appellate order passed by the Sessions Judge modifying the original sentence was wrong, and in that sense, the issue of notice under s. 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure against appellant No. 1 to show cause why his sentence should not be enhanced may have been justified; but, in enhancing the sentence, the High Court should, we think, have restored the sentence passed by the trial judge himself. It is true that, in enhancing the sentence, the High Court has observed that " women in this country, whether chaste or unchaste, must be protected and that it is the duty of the court to see that they are given sufficient protection ". We are inclined to think that the considera- tion set out in this observation is really not, very helpful and not decisive because, as we have already observed, s. 498 does not purport to protect the rights of women but it safeguards the rights of husbands. Besides, in the present case, it is clear that Mst. Rahmatia, who is a woman of loose moral character, was dissatisfied with the complainant, who is her second husband, and was willing to marry appellant No. 1. In such a case, though appellant No. I is guilty under s. 498, it is difficult to accept the view of the High Court that the sentence of two months' simple imprisonment imposed on him, by the trial court was so unduly or manifestly lenient as not to meet the ends of justice. It would not be right for the appellate court to interfere with the order of sentence passed by the trial court merely on the ground that if it had tried the case it would have imposed a slightly higher or heavier sentence. We would accordingly modify the order of sentence passed against appellant No. 1 by reducing it to that of simple imprisonment for two months.
The case of appellant No. 2 is clearly different from that of appellant No. 1. The findings of fact recorded by the courts below do not implicate appellant No. 2 in the act of persuasion or offering blandishments or inducements to Mst. Rahmatia. The only evidence against this appellant is that when the complainant went to take away his wife appellant No. 2 threatened him. The record shows that appellant No. 2 is the brother of appellant No. 1; and, if knowing that Rahmatia had married his brother, appellant No. 2 told the complainant to walk away, that cannot legally justify the inference that he must have offered any inducement, blandishment or allurement to Rahmatia for leaving the protection of her husband and refusing to return to him. Indeed the courts below have not considered the case of this appellant separately on its own merits at all. In our opinion, the conviction of appellant No. 2 is not supported by any evidence on the record. The result is the appeal preferred by appellant No. 2 is allowed, the order of conviction and sentence passed against him is set aside and he is ordered to be acquitted and discharged.
Appeal of appellant No. 1 dismissed.
Appeal of appellant No. 2 allowed.	Conclusion
CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 187 of 1956.
Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated December 7, 1955, of the Patna High Court in Criminal Revision No. 875 of 1954, arising out of the judgment and order dated May 31, 1954, of the Court of the Additional Sessions Judge at Arrah in Criminal Appeal No. 293 of 1953.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by GAJENDERAGADKAR, J.-This criminal appeal raises a short question about the construction of the word " detains "

It need not necessarily be by physical force. It may be by persuasion or, as the Court " (Madras High Court) " has observed in this particular case" (Sundara Dass Thevan (4)) " by allurement or blandishment ". On the facts, however, it appeared to the trial court that the conduct of the accused did not bring his case within the mischief of s.
498. The wife of the complainant had been taken (1) A.I.R. (1953) Mad. 333.
(3) (1933) I.L.R. 58 Bom. 88, 92.
(2) (1902) IV Bom. L. R. 435.
(4) (1868) IV Mad. H. C. R. 20.
away by her brother and she was subsequently married by natra marriage to the accused. The complainant learnt about this incident and went to the accused to ask him to allow his wife to go back to him. On seeing the complainant and his friends the accused came out with a dharia and threatened the complainant and his companions who then re- turned to their village. The conduct of the accused' when the complainant approached him, it was said, cannot necessarily indicate that the accused had detained the woman. This was the' view taken by the trial court who acquitted the accused ; on appeal the High Court saw no reason to differ and so the order of acquittal was confirmed by it. Divatia, J., who delivered the concurring judgment apparently differed from Broomfield, J., in regard to the construction of the word " detains ". He agreed that the scheme of s. 498 showed that though the woman may be perfectly willing to go with the man the offence of taking or enticing away would occur because it simply consists of taking or enticing away a woman without anything more; but according to him, in the latter part of the section, which speaks of concealing or detaining the woman, the woman would be detained only if she is prevented from going in any quarter where she wants to go. In our opinion, this construction is not sound. It is not easy to see how the act of concealing the woman would necessarily import any considerations of the consent of the woman ; besides, according to Divatia, J., himself, the woman's Consent would be irrelevant in the cases of -taking or enticing her away. If that be so, it is difficult to make her consent relevant and decisive in dealing with the cases of detention. Unfortunately the learned judge does not appear to have appreciated the fact that the primary and the sole object of s. 498 is to protect the husband's rights and not the rights of the wife. If it is shown that the woman's inclination to stay away from her husband was either instigated or encouraged by the offender, she can be said to have been detained or kept away from her husband within the meaning of the section though at the time of the detention she may be willing to say with the offender. The same view has been expressed by Broomfield and Sen, JJ., in Emperor v.Ram Narayan Baburao Kapur (1) and by Beaumont C.J., and Sen, J., in Mahadeo Rama v. Emperor (2). We may point out that in both these cases the court was have detained the woman.
The Calcutta High Court appears to have put a similar construction on the word "detention". In Prithi Missir v. Harak Nath Singh (3) it has been held by the said High Court that " the word ' detention' is ejusdem generis with enticement and concealment. It does not imply that the woman is being kept against her will but there must be evidence to show that the accused did something which had the effect of preventing the woman from returning to her husband ".

In fact it did not appear that the accused was keeping the complainant's wife as his mistress; and on the whole, the court was not satisfied that the accused was responsible for the conduct of the complainant's wife for leaving her husband's house and so detention was held not proved against the accused. In Mabarak Sheikh v. Ahmed Newaz (4) the same High Court held that there can be no detention of a woman within the meaning of s. 498, second part, if the woman is an absolutely free agent to go away from the person charged whenever she likes. It appears that the learned judges were inclined to hold that there could be no detention if the woman was an absolutely free agent to go away from the person charged whenever she likes to do so; and in support of this view they have referred to some of the decisions which we have already considered. With respect, it appears that the effect of the earlier decisions has not been properly considered and the findings of fact recorded in the said decisions are assumed to lend colour to, and modify, the construction of the section (1) (1937) 39 Bom. L.R. 61.

adopted by them. Besides, the relevant observations appear to be obiter because, on the facts, it was found in this case that the woman was not a free agent and so the charge against the accused under s. 498 was held established. In Bipad Bhanjan Sarkar v. Emperor (1), Henderson and Khundkar, JJ., have considered the word " detains " in the same manner as we have done. However, as in many other cases, in this case also, the court found that there was absolutely nothing to show that the accused had done anything which could bring his case within the mischief of s. 498.
