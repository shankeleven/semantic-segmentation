1954. April 1. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by GHULAM HASAN J.-This is an appeal by special leave granted by the Privy Council against the judgment and decree dated July 12, 1944, of a Division Bench of the High Court at Lahore passed in second appeal confirming the dismissal of the appellants' suit cone currently by the trial Court and the Court of the District Judge, Gurdaspur. The two appellants are admittedly the first cousins of the respondent, Harnam Singh, and belong to village Gillanwali, Tahsil Batala, District Gurdaspur. Gurmej Singh, respondent No. 2, is a collateral of Harnam Singh in the 8th degree. The appellants sued for a declaration that the deed of adoption executed by Harnam Singh on July 30, 1940, adopting Gurmej Singh was invalid and could not affect the reversionary rights of the appellants after the death of Harnam Singh. The appellant's case was that under the Customary Law of Gurdaspur District applicable to the Gill Jats ,of village Gillanwali, Harnam Singh could only adopt a is near collateral" and Gurmej Singh being a distant collateral his adoption was invalid. The defence was a denial of the plaintiffs' claim. Both the trial Judge and the District Judge on appeal held that the factum and the validity of the adoption were fully established. In second appeal Trevor Harries C. J. and Mahajan J. (as he then was) held that there was sufficient evidence of the factum of adoption as furnished by the deed and the subsequent conduct of Harnam Singh. They held that all that was necessary under the custom to constitute an adoption was the expression of a clear intention on the part of the adoptive father to adopt the boy concerned as his son and this intention was clearly manifested here by the execution and registration of the deed of adoption coupled with the public declarations and treatment as adopted son. Upon the legal validity of the adoption the High Court found that the answer to Question 9 of the Riwaj-i-am of Gurdaspur District of the year 1913 laying down that the adoption of "near collaterals only " was recognised was not mandatory. The High Court relied in support of their conclusion on a decision of Tek Chand J. in Jowala v. Diwan Singh (1) and the Privy Council decision in Basant Singh v. Brij Raj Saran Singh (2).
The first question regarding the factum of adoption need not detain us long. The deed of adoption, Exhibit D. 1, recites that Harnam Singh had no male issue who could perform his kiry a karam ceremony after his death, that Gurmej Singh had been brought up while he was an infant by his wife and that he had adopted him according to the prevailing custom. The recital continues that since the adoption he had been treating and calling Gurmej Singh as his adopted son. This fact was well,-known in the village and the adoptee was en- joying all rights of a son. He had executed a formal document in his favour in order to put an end to any dispute which might be raised about his adoption. As adopted son he made him the owner of all of his property. We are satisfied that there is ample evidence to sustain the finding on the factum of adoption.
these formalities are not observed the adoption is not considered valid."
In Jowala v. Dewan Singh(1) Tek Chand J. held "that an adoption of a collateral in the fourth degree, among Jats of Mauza Hussanpur, Tahsil Nakodar, District Jullundur, is valid although nearer collaterals are alive." He also held "that an entry in the Riwaj-i-am as to the persons who can be adopted is merely indicatory".
In a case from Delhi reported in Basant Singh and Others v. Brij Raj Saran Singh(2)the Privy Council held "that the restriction in the Riwaj-i-am of adoption to persons of the same gotra is recommendatory and a person of a different gotra may be adopted."
Counsel for the appellants frankly conceded that he could cite no case where the declarations governing customary adoptions were held to be mandatory.	Precedent
The main question which falls to be considered is whether under the terms of the Riwaj-i-am applicable to the parties, Gurmej Singh being a collateral of Harnam Singh in the 8th degree could be validly adopted. The custom in question is founded on Question 9 and its answer the Customary Law of the Gurdaspur District. They are as follows:-
Gurdaspur. Tahsil could not come to an agreement on this point. The remaining tribes recognise the adoption of War collaterals only. The right of selection rests with the person adopting. The Khatris, Brahmans and Bedis and Sodis of the Gurdaspur Tahsil, however, state that the nearest collaterals cannot be sperseded and selection should always be made from among them"
near collaterals only " must be construed to mean a collateral up to the third degree and does not cover the case of a remote collateral in the 8th degree. The restriction as regards the degree of relationship of the adoptee, it is urged, is mandatory and cannot be ignored. The expression " near collaterals " is not defined by the custom. The relevant answer which we have underlined above gives no indication as to the precise import of the words "	Section
Whether a particular rule recorded in the Riwaj-i-am is mandatory or directory must depend on what is the essential characteristic of the custom. Under the Hindu Law adoption is primarily a religious act intended to confer spiritual benefit on the adopter and some of the rules have, therefore, been held to be mandatory and compliance with them regarded as a condition of the validity of the adoption.

Appeal dismissed.	Conclusion

1954. April 1. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by GHULAM HASAN J.-This is an appeal by special leave granted by the Privy Council against the judgment and decree dated July 12, 1944, of a Division Bench of the High Court at Lahore passed in second appeal confirming the dismissal of the appellants' suit cone currently by the trial Court and the Court of the District Judge, Gurdaspur. The two appellants are admittedly the first cousins of the respondent, Harnam Singh, and belong to village Gillanwali, Tahsil Batala, District Gurdaspur. Gurmej Singh, respondent No. 2, is a collateral of Harnam Singh in the 8th degree. The appellants sued for a declaration that the deed of adoption executed by Harnam Singh on July 30, 1940, adopting Gurmej Singh was invalid and could not affect the reversionary rights of the appellants after the death of Harnam Singh. The appellant's case was that under the Customary Law of Gurdaspur District applicable to the Gill Jats ,of village Gillanwali, Harnam Singh could only adopt a is near collateral" and Gurmej Singh being a distant collateral his adoption was invalid. The defence was a denial of the plaintiffs' claim. Both the trial Judge and the District Judge on appeal held that the factum and the validity of the adoption were fully established. In second appeal Trevor Harries C. J. and Mahajan J. (as he then was) held that there was sufficient evidence of the factum of adoption as furnished by the deed and the subsequent conduct of Harnam Singh. They held that all that was necessary under the custom to constitute an adoption was the expression of a clear intention on the part of the adoptive father to adopt the boy concerned as his son and this intention was clearly manifested here by the execution and registration of the deed of adoption coupled with the public declarations and treatment as adopted son. Upon the legal validity of the adoption the High Court found that the answer to Question 9 of the Riwaj-i-am of Gurdaspur District of the year 1913 laying down that the adoption of "near collaterals only " was recognised was not mandatory. The High Court relied in support of their conclusion on a decision of Tek Chand J. in Jowala v. Diwan Singh (1) and the Privy Council decision in Basant Singh v. Brij Raj Saran Singh (2).
The first question regarding the factum of adoption need not detain us long. The deed of adoption, Exhibit D. 1, recites that Harnam Singh had no male issue who could perform his kiry a karam ceremony after his death, that Gurmej Singh had been brought up while he was an infant by his wife and that he had adopted him according to the prevailing custom. The recital continues that since the adoption he had been treating and calling Gurmej Singh as his adopted son. This fact was well,-known in the village and the adoptee was en- joying all rights of a son. He had executed a formal document in his favour in order to put an end to any dispute which might be raised about his adoption. As adopted son he made him the owner of all of his property. We are satisfied that there is ample evidence to sustain the finding on the factum of adoption.
The main question which falls to be considered is whether under the terms of the Riwaj-i-am applicable to the parties, Gurmej Singh being a collateral of Harnam Singh in the 8th degree could be validly adopted. The custom in question is founded on Question 9 and its answer the Customary Law of the Gurdaspur District. They are as follows:-
Gurdaspur. Tahsil could not come to an agreement on this point. The remaining tribes recognise the adoption of War collaterals only. The right of selection rests with the person adopting. The Khatris, Brahmans and Bedis and Sodis of the Gurdaspur Tahsil, however, state that the nearest collaterals cannot be sperseded and selection should always be made from among them"
near collaterals only " must be construed to mean a collateral up to the third degree and does not cover the case of a remote collateral in the 8th degree. The restriction as regards the degree of relationship of the adoptee, it is urged, is mandatory and cannot be ignored. The expression " near collaterals " is not defined by the custom. The relevant answer which we have underlined above gives no indication as to the precise import of the words "
these formalities are not observed the adoption is not considered valid."
The adoption was challenged on the ground that there was no gathering of the brotherhood. The learned Judges (Addison and Beckett JJ.) held that it was immaterial whether there was or was not a gathering of the brotherhood at the time. It appears that the adopter had made a statement in Court acknowledging the appointment or adoption in question. The next day he celebrated the marriage of the boy as his son, and thereafter he looked after his education and allowed him to describe himself as his adopted son or appointed heir, and the boy lived with him as his son. The learned Judges held that the details given in the answers to questions in various Customary Laws were not necessarily mandatory but might be merely indicatory.
In Jowala v. Dewan Singh(1) Tek Chand J. held "that an adoption of a collateral in the fourth degree, among Jats of Mauza Hussanpur, Tahsil Nakodar, District Jullundur, is valid although nearer collaterals are alive." He also held "that an entry in the Riwaj-i-am as to the persons who can be adopted is merely indicatory".
In a case from Delhi reported in Basant Singh and Others v. Brij Raj Saran Singh(2)the Privy Council held "that the restriction in the Riwaj-i-am of adoption to persons of the same gotra is recommendatory and a person of a different gotra may be adopted."
Counsel for the appellants frankly conceded that he could cite no case where the declarations governing customary adoptions were held to be mandatory.
Whether a particular rule recorded in the Riwaj-i-am is mandatory or directory must depend on what is the essential characteristic of the custom. Under the Hindu Law adoption is primarily a religious act intended to confer spiritual benefit on the adopter and some of the rules have, therefore, been held to be mandatory and compliance with them regarded as a condition of the validity of the adoption. On the other hand, under the (1) 166 I.C. 237.
(2) 57 All, 494.
Customary Law in the Punjab, adoption is secular in character, the object being to appoint an heir and the rules relating to ceremonies and to preferences in selection have to be held to be directory and adoptions made in disregard of them are not invalid.
There is no substance in the appeal and we dismiss it with costs.
