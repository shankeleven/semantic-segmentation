CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeals Nos. 292 and 312 of 1950.
Appeals from the Judgment and Order of the High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad (Ansari, Qamar Hasan and Manohar Pershad JJ.) in Cases Nos. 180-181 of 1954 F. Ved Vyas, (S. K. Kapur and Ganpat Rai, with him) for the appellant.	Issue
1954. April 1. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI J.-These are two appeals from the judgment and decision of the High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad answering certain questions referred at the instance of the appellants by the Commissioner of Excess Profits Tax, Hyderabad, and adjudging the liability of the appellants for excess profits tax in regard to the amounts recieved by them as remuneration from the Dewan Bahadur Ramgopal Mills Com- pany Ltd. as its Agents.
These questions were of considerable importance and were referred for decision to the Full Bench of the High Court. The Full Bench of the High Court delivered their judgment the majority deciding the questions (2) and (3) which were the only questions considered determinative of the reference against the appellants. The appellants appealed to the Judicial Committee. But before the Judicial Committee heard the appeals there was a merger of the territories of Hyderabad with India. The appeals finally came for hearing before the Supreme Court Bench at Hyderabad on the 12th December, 1950, when an order was passed transferring the appeals to this Court at Delhi. These appeals have now come for hearing and final disposal before us.
The questions (1) and (4) which were referred by the Commissioner to the High Court at Hyderabad have not been seriously pressed before us. Whether the appellants are a partnership firm or a registered company the principle of exclusion of the income from the category of business income by reason of its depending wholly or mainly on the personal qualifications of the assessee would not apply because the income could not be said to be income from profession and neither a partnership firm nor a registered company as such could be said to be possessed of any personal qualifications in the matter of the acquisition of that income. The principal questions which were therefore argued before the High Court at Hyderabad and before us were the questions (2) and (3) which involved the determination of the position of the appellants whether they were servants or agents of the Mills Company and the determination of the character of their remuneration whether it was wages or salary or income, profits or gains from business.
The Agency agreement which was executed in pursuance of the appointment under Article 115, provided that the appellants and their assigns were to be the Agents of the Company for a period of 30 years from the date of registration of the Company and they were to continue to act as such agents until they of their own will resigned. The remuneration of the appellants as such Agents was to be a commission of per cent on the amount of sale proceeds of all yarn cloth and other produce of the Company (including cotton grown) which commission was to be exclusive of any remuneration or wages payable to the bankers, Solicitors engineers, etc., who may be employed by the appellants for or on behalf of the Company or for carrying on and conducting the business of the Company. The appellants were to be paid in addition all expenses and charges actually incurred by them in Connection with the. business of the Company and supervision and management thereof and the appelants were entitled to appoint any person or persons in Bombay to act as their Agents in Bombay and any other places in connection with the business if the Company.
The objects of the appellants in this case inter alia were to act as agents for Governments or Authorities or for any bankers, manufacturers, merchants, shippers, Joint Stock Companies and others and carry on all kinds of agency business. This object standing by itself would comprise within its ambit the activities of the appellants as the agents of the Company and constitute the work which they did by way of general management of the business of the company an agency business. The words " carry on all kinds of agency business " occurring at the end of the object as therein set out were capable of including within their general description the work which the appellants would do as agents for Governments or Authorities or for any bankers, manufacturers, merchants, shippers and-others when they acted as agents of the Company which were manufacturers inter - alia of cotton piece goods they would be carrying on agency business within the meaning of this object. Apart however from this there is the further fact that there was a continuity of operations which constituted the activities of the appellants in the general management of the Company a business. The whole work of management which the appellants did for the Company within the powers conferred upon them under Article 116 of the Articles of Association and clause 3 of the Agency Agreement consisted of numerous and continuous operations and comprised of various services which were rendered by the appellants as the agents of the Company. The appellants were also entitled though with the sanction or ratification by the Board of Directors either before or after the dealings to enter into dealings with the Company by way of sales and purchases of various commodities. There was nothing in the Agency Agreement to prevent the appellants from acting as the agents of other manufacturers, Joint Stock Companies etc., and the appel- lants could have as well acted as the agents of other concerns besides the Company. All these factors taken, into consideration alongwith the fixity of tenure, the nature of remuneration and the assignability of their rights, are sufficient to enable us to 'come to the conclusion that the activities of the appellants as the agents of the Company constituted a business and the remuneration which the appellants received from the Company under the terms of the Agency Agreement was income, profits or gain from business. The appellants were therefore rightly assessed for excess profits tax and these appeals must stand dismissed with costs.	Facts
The Mills Company was registered on the 14th February, 1920, at Hyderabad in the then territories of His Exalted Highness the Nizam. The appellants were registered as a private limited company at Bombay on agreement was entered into between the Mills Company. and the appellants appointing the appellants its Agents for a period of 30 years on certain terms and conditions therein recorded. The appellants throughout worked only as the Agents of the Mills Company and for the Fasli years 1351 and 1352 they received their remuneration under the terms of the Agency agreement. A notice was issued under section 13 of the Hyderabad Excess Profits Tax Regulation by the Excess Profits Tax Officer calling upon the appellants to pay the, amount of tax appertaining to these chargeable account- , ing periods. The appellants submitted their accounts and contended that the remuneration received by them from the Mills Company was not taxable on the ground that it is was not income, profits or gains from business and was outside the pale of the Excess Profits Tax Regulation. This contention of the appellants was negatived and on the 24th April, 1944, the Excess Profits Tax Officer made an order assessing the income of the appellants for the accounting periods 1351 and 1352 Fasli at Rs. 8,957 and Rs. 83,768 respectively and assessed the tax accordingly. An appeal was taken by the appellants to the Deputy Commissioner of Excess Profits Tax who disallowed the same. An application made by the appellants under section 48(2) for statement of the case to the High Court was rejected by the Commissioner and the appellants filed a petition to the High Court under section 48(3) to compel the Commissioner to state the case to the High Court. An order was made by the High,Court on this petition directing the Commissioner to state the case and the statement of the case was submitted by the Commis- sioner on the 26th February, 1946. Four questions were referred by the Commissioner to the High Courts as under:-
The appellants were registered as a private limited company having their registered office in Bombay and the objects for which they were incorporated were the following:
Under Article 115 of the Articles of Association of the Mills Company the appellants and their assigns were' appointed the agents of the Company upon the terms,
Clause 8 provided that two of the members for the time being of the appellants were at the option of the appellants to be the ex-officio Directors of the Company and clause 9 empowered the appellants to assign the agreement and the rights of the appellants thereunder subject to the approval and sanction of the Board to any person, firm or Company having authority by its constitution to become bound by the obligations undertaken by the appeallants. No materials other than these 'were placed by the appellants either before the Income-tax Authorities or the High Court and the questions that arise before us have to be determined only on these materials. If on the construction of these documents we arrive at the conclusion that the position of the appellants was not that of servants but the agents of the Company the further question would have to be determined whether the activities of the appellants amounted to the carrying on of business. If they were not the servants of the Company, the remuneration which they received would certainly not be wages or salary but if they were agents of the Company the question would still survive whether their activities amounted to the carrying on of business in which case only the remuneration which they received from the Company would be income, profits or gains from business.

Clauses 3 and 4 of the agency agreement are important and may be set out in extenso :-
(a)Generally a master can tell his servant what to do and how to do it.
(b) Generally a principal cannot tell his agent how to carryout his instructions.
(c) A servant is under more complete control than an agent, and also at page 20:-
The statement of the law contained in Halsbury's Laws of England-Hailsham Edition-Volume 22, page 113, paragraph 192 may be referred to in this connection :-
The position is further clarified in Halsbury's Laws of England-Hailsham Edition-,Volume 1, at page. 193, article 345 where the positions of an agent, a a servant and independent contractor are thus distinguished : -
agreed to share the profits of a business -carried on by all or any of then acting for all. (See Inderchand Hari Ram V. COMMissioner of Income-tax, U.P & C.P.(1)). But when a company is incorporated it may not necessarily come into existence for the purpose of carrying on a business. According to section 5 of the Indian Companies Act any seven or more persons (or, where the company to be formed will be a private company, any two or more persons) associated for any lawful purpose may by subscribing their names to a memorandum of association.............................. form an incorporated company, and the lawful purpose for which the persons become associated might not necessarily be the carrying on of business. When a company is incorporated for carrying out certain activities it would be relevant to enquire what are the objects for which it has been incorporated. As was observed by Lord Sterndale, M.R., in Commissioners of Inland Revenuev. The Korean Syndicate Limited(2) :
Justice Rowlatt followed the above view of Lord Sterndale, M.R., in Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Birmingham Theatre Royal Estate Co., Limited(1), and held that " when you are considering whether a certain form of enterprise is carrying on business or not, it is material to look and see whether it is a company that it; doing it." The objects of an incorporated company as laid down in the Memorandum of Association are (1) [1952] I.T.R. 108.	Precedent
-provisions and conditions set out in the Agreement referred to in clause 6 of the Company's Memorandum of Association. Article 116 provided that the general management of the business of the Company subject to the control and supervision of the Directors, was to be in the hands of the Agents of the Company, who were to have the power and authority on behalf of the Company, subject to such control and supervision, to enter into all contracts and to do all other things usual, necessary and desirable in the management of the, affairs of the Company or in carrying out its objects and were to have power to appoint and employ in, or. for the purposes of the transaction and managment of the affairs and business of the Company, or otherwise for the purposes thereof, and from time to time to remove or suspend such managers, agents, clerks and other employees as they thought proper with such powers and duties and upon such terms as to duration of employment, remuneration or otherwise as they thought fit and were also to have powers to exercise all rights and liberties reserved and granted to them by the said agreement referred to in clause 6 of the Company's Memorandum of Association including the rights and liberties contained in clause 4 of the agreement. Article 1 18 authorised the agents to sub-delegate all or any of the powers, authorities and discretions for the time being vested in them, and in particular from time to time to provide by the appointment of an attorney or attorneys, for the management and transaction of the affairs of the Company in any specified locality, in such manner as they thought fit.
certainly not conclusive of the question whether the activities of the company amount to carrying on of business. (See Indian Law Reports 55 Calcutta 1059 and (1951] 19 I.T.R. 571). But they are relevant for the purpose of determining the nature and scope of such activities.	Section

These appeals have now come for hearing and final disposal before us.
The questions (1) and (4) which were referred by the Commissioner to the High Court at Hyderabad have not been seriously pressed before us.

The appellants were registered as a private limited company having their registered office in Bombay and the objects for which they were incorporated were the following:
Under Article 115 of the Articles of Association of the Mills Company the appellants and their assigns were' appointed the agents of the Company upon the terms,
-provisions and conditions set out in the Agreement referred to in clause 6 of the Company's Memorandum of Association. Article 116 provided that the general management of the business of the Company subject to the control and supervision of the Directors, was to be in the hands of the Agents of the Company, who were to have the power and authority on behalf of the Company, subject to such control and supervision, to enter into all contracts and to do all other things usual, necessary and desirable in the management of the, affairs of the Company or in carrying out its objects and were to have power to appoint and employ in, or. for the purposes of the transaction and managment of the affairs and business of the Company, or otherwise for the purposes thereof, and from time to time to remove or suspend such managers, agents, clerks and other employees as they thought proper with such powers and duties and upon such terms as to duration of employment, remuneration or otherwise as they thought fit and were also to have powers to exercise all rights and liberties reserved and granted to them by the said agreement referred to in clause 6 of the Company's Memorandum of Association including the rights and liberties contained in clause 4 of the agreement. Article 1 18 authorised the agents to sub-delegate all or any of the powers, authorities and discretions for the time being vested in them, and in particular from time to time to provide by the appointment of an attorney or attorneys, for the management and transaction of the affairs of the Company in any specified locality, in such manner as they thought fit.
The Agency agreement which was executed in pursuance of the appointment under Article 115, provided that the appellants and their assigns were to be the Agents of the Company for a period of 30 years from the date of registration of the Company and they were to continue to act as such agents until they of their own will resigned.

Clauses 3 and 4 of the agency agreement are important and may be set out in extenso :-
Clause 8 provided that two of the members for the time being of the appellants were at the option of the appellants to be the ex-officio Directors of the Company and clause 9 empowered the appellants to assign the agreement and the rights of the appellants thereunder subject to the approval and sanction of the Board to any person, firm or Company having authority by its constitution to become bound by the obligations undertaken by the appeallants.

The objects of the appellants in this case inter alia were to act as agents for Governments or Authorities or for any bankers, manufacturers, merchants, shippers, Joint Stock Companies and others and carry on all kinds of agency business.
