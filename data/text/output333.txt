Commissioner Of ... vs Messrs. Bhogilal Laherchand ... on 18 December, 1953	Case Title
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 160 of 1950.
Appeal against the judgment and Decree dated the 30th March, 1951, of the High Court of judicature at Bombay (Chagla C. J. and Tendolkar J.) in Income Tax Reference No. 34 of 1950.
1953. December 18. The judgment of the Court ,was delivered by MAHAJAN J.-This is an appeal from the Judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay delivered on a reference under section 66 (1) of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, whereby the High Court answered the first referred question in the negative.
This appeal is before us on a certificate granted by the High Court, and the only question canvassed here is whether section 42 (1) of the Indian Income-tax Act has application to the case of a resident assesses or whether its scope is limited to a non-resident assessee alone. It is common ground that if section 42 of the Act has no application to the case of a resident assessee, the whole of the Mysore profit, namely Rs. 75,000, cannot -be included in the assessment of the year 1943-44. On the other hand, if such an assessee is within the ambit of the section, in that event the sum of Rs. 37,000 or any part of it would be liable to assessment during the assessment year in question.

The High Court returned an answer to the question' in the negative after resettling it in these terms :-
Profits Tax, Madras,v,. Parasuram Jethanand (1). Again the matter was -discussed in this court in Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay v. Ahmedbhai Umarbhai & Co.(2) by, Patanjali Sastri J., as he then was, and also by Mukherjea J. in the same case. This is what Patanjali Sastri J. said on this point:-
The same view was expressed by Mukherjea J. ,Nothing that has been said by Mr. Kolah before us justifies reconsideration of these opinions.	Precedent
The assessment in question concerns the year 194344. A Hindu undivided family was carrying on business in Bombay., Madras and the Mysore State. Its business was taken over by a registered firm on 17th March, 1942. For the purpose of this appeal however this circumstance is not material. The case has been dealt with on the assumption that a single assessee carried on, business from 10th October, 1941 to 8th November, 1942, the relevant accounting year. According to the accounts of the assessee, during this period the Mysore branch purchased goods from the Bombay head office and the Madras Branch of the value of Rs. 2,45,455. The Income-tax officer estimated these purchases of the Mysore branch in British India at Rs. 3,00,000 and its profits at Rs. 75,000 on the sale of these goods in Mysore. In view of the provisions of section 42 of the Act, half of this profit, i.e., to the extent of Rs. 37,000, was deemed to accrue or arise in British India, because of the business connection of the non-resident, branch in British India. It was contended that the assessee being a person resident in India, section 42 could not be invoked in the case, because that section had-application only to cases of non-residents. The Income-tax Tribunal following the decision of the Bombay High Court, in Commissioner of Income-tax 'V. Western ,India Life, Insurance Co. Ltd.(1), upheld this contention, 'and ruled that no part of the Mysore profit could be taxed in British India. At the instance of the Commissioner of Income-tax/Excess Profits Tax, Bombay City, three questions were referred to the High Court under section 66 (1), the first of these being "Whether in the circumstances of the case can the profits on the sale of goods in the Mysore State be deemed to accrue or arise in British -India under' section 42 (1) of the Indian Income-tax Act"-
Section 42 of the Act is in these terms:
or through or - -from any money lent at interest and brought into the taxable territories in cash or in kind or through or from the sale, exchange or transfer of a capital asset in the taxable territories, shall be chargeable to income-tax either in his name or in the name of his agent, - and in the latter case such agent shall be deemed to be, for all the purposes of this Act, the assessee in respect of such income-tax :
Before its amendment in the year 1939 the first part of the section tin thus:
The rest of the section was substantially in the same terms. Inspite of its amendment in 1939 the marginal note to the section continued to refer to "non-resident" as before, though the words 'residing out of British India"
It is significant that the changes made in section 42 in the year 1939 were consequential to the entire recasting of section 4 of 'the Act., Section 4 as it stood prior to 1939 charged income-tax on all income, profits or gains, from whatever source derived, accruing or arising or received in British India or deemed under the provisions of the Act to' accrue, or arise, or' to be received in British India. It further' provided that the"income,profits and gains accruing or arising , without British India to a person resident in British,' India, shall, 'if they are received in or brought into British India, be' deemed to have accrued or arisen in British India and to be income, profits and gains, of the year in which they are so received or brought, notwith- standing the fact that they did not so, accrue or arise in that year. By the amendment in the year 1939, the total income of any previous' year of any person was defined as including 'all income, Profits and gains from whatever source derived which
a) are received or are deemed to be received in British(a) India in such year by or on behalf of such person, or
(b) if such person is resident in British India during such year,-
(1) accrue or arise or are deemed to accrue or arise to him in British India during such year; or
(ii) accrue or arise to him without British India during such year ; or............
(c) if such person is not resident in British India during such year, accrue or arise or are deemed to accrue or arise to him in British India during such year;......" This legislative change in the Act made all income accruing or arising or deemed to accrue or arise in British India during the previous year to a resident the subject of a charge, apart from income accruing or arising- without British India during the previous year.
The term "deemed" brings within the net of chargeability income not actually accruing but which is supposed notionally to have accrued. It involves a number of concepts. By, statutory fiction income which can in no sense be said to accrue at all may be considered as so accruing. Similarly, the fiction may relate to the place, the person or be in respect of the year of taxability. Section 42(1) defines what income is deemed to accrue within the taxable territories. It is only by application of this definition that one class of income "deemed to accrue to a resident within taxable territories" within the meaning of section 4(1) (b) () can be estimated. The words "In the case of any person residing out of British India" were deleted from section 42(1) during the pendency of the amendment. Bill of 1939 in the Council of State presumably with the object of making the section applicable to any person who had any income which in a primary sense arose in British India, even though technically it had arisen abroad, irrespective of the circumstance whether that person was resident, ordinarily resident or not ordinarily resident. By section 8 of Act XXIII of 1941, clause (c) was added to section 14 of the Act. No effect was to be given to this amendment before the year ending 31st March, 1943. The relevant part of section 14, after this amendment is in these terms:-
In view of these legislative changes in the provisions of sections 4, 14 and 42 of the Act, the conclusion is irresistible that the object of recasting section 41(1) in general terms was to make the definition of "deemed income"
Act of Parliament, cannot be- referred to for the pur- pose, of construing the statute, and it may be mentioned in this connection that the, marginal note relied on has since been replaced by the words 'Income deemed to accrue ;or arise within', British India which makes it clear that the 'main object, of sub-section (1) was to define that expression (see section 12 (a) of Act XXII Of 1947). Nor can the title of a chapter be legitimately used to restrict the plain terms of an enactment."
Mr. Kolah argued that when the world income of a resident was, brought within the net of chargeability by section 4 in 1939 it was then wholly unnecessary to include such an assessee in the ambit of section 42. In our judgment, this contention is fallacious. Whatever income arises in a primary sense to a resident in taxable territories is chargeable under section 4 (1) (b) (1). Hence it was necessary to make section 42 applicable to such a case. Whatever other consideration may arise in estimating the foreign income -of a resident will not be applicable to income deemed to accrue within taxable territory. Moreover, as above pointed out, in view of the provisions of section 14 (c) resident assessees but for section 42(1) would not be liable to assessment regarding income accruing to them in Part B States, even if there is a business connection in taxable territory. Mr. Kolah was unable to suggest any reasonable explanation for the deletion of the words "any person residing out of British India" from section 42(1) as it stood before 1930. The Only purpose in deleting these words could be to bring residents within the a ambit of the section. There is no reason whatsoever for not giving to the plain words of the section the meaning that on the face of it they bear.	Section
For the reasons given above we are of the that the answer by the High of Bombay to the first question referred to it was wrong. We therefore allow this appeal with costs and answer 7-93 S.C.India/59 this question referred to the High Court in the affirmative.
Appeal allowed.

Section 42 of the Act is in these terms:
or through or - -from any money lent at interest and brought into the taxable territories in cash or in kind or through or from the sale, exchange or transfer of a capital asset in the taxable territories, shall be chargeable to income-tax either in his name or in the name of his agent, - and in the latter case such agent shall be deemed to be, for all the purposes of this Act, the assessee in respect of such income-tax :

By the amendment in the year 1939, the total income of any previous' year of any person was defined as including 'all income, Profits and gains from whatever source derived which
a) are received or are deemed to be received in British(a) India in such year by or on behalf of such person, or

The relevant part of section 14, after this amendment is in these terms:-
In view of these legislative changes in the provisions of sections 4, 14 and 42 of the Act, the conclusion is irresistible that the object of recasting section 41(1) in general terms was to make the definition of "deemed income"
