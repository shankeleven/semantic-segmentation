Gordhandas Lalji vs B. Banerjee & Ors on 7 April, 1958	Case Title
JUDGMENT with Civil Appeal No. 665 of 1957 1958 AIR (SC) 1006 The Judgment was delivered by GAJENDRAGADKAR, J. :	Issue
In the result, the appellant's taxable turnover was held to amount to Rs. 5, 09, 988-0-0 and on that basis he was assessed to pay the tax at Rs. 23, 905-11-0 and a demand in that behalf was issued.	Facts
It was this order of the appellate authority that was challenged by the appellant in his petition filed before the High Court at Calcutta. Sinha, J., rejected the petition on two grounds. He held that the return filed by the appellant was the foundation of the present assessment proceedings and since the return had not been filed on the footing of an agent, the appellant's case that, it regard to the transactions in question, he was no more than an agent acting for his principals in Bombay cannot succeed. The learned Judge also found that the sale of the goods by the appellant to the Bombay parties was complete when it was appropriated to the contract billed for and the price realised. The shipping to foreign ports of the goods thus sold was no part of the sale by the appellant to the Bombay parties; it constituted an event which is post-sale. It was on these findings that the appellant's claim for exemption under section 5(2)(a)(v) of the Act as well as Article 286(1)(b) of the Constitution was rejected. This order was challenged by the appellant by preferring an appeal but Chakravartti, C.J., and Lahiri, J., who heard the appeal were not impressed by the arguments urged on behalf of the appellant. The result was that the appeal failed and was dismissed. The learned Judges of the Appellate Bench observed that the plea that the appellant was an agent was not seriously pressed before them and they held that the plea for exemption under Article 286(1)(b) was not well-founded because the sales in which the appellant was interested were completed as soon as the goods were appropriated to his contracts with the Bombay parties and whether subsequently the Bombay parties consigned the goods to themselves at some place outside India or to other parties was no concern to the appellant. It is against this appellate order that the present appeal has been brought to this Court by the appellant by special leave.The first point which has been raised before us by Shri Veda Vyas on behalf of the appellant is that the High Court was in error in rejecting the appellant's case that, in purchasing the teas in question at the public auction in Calcutta, the appellant was acting merely as an agent for his principals in Bombay. The argument is that, since the appellant purchased the goods not as a dealer for himself or on his own behalf but as an agent for and on behalf of his principals in Bombay, the transactions cannot be treated as a part of the appellant's turnover which could be taxed under the Act. In our opinion there is no substance in this argument. It is significant that the appellant has obtained a certificate under the Act as a dealer and in consequence he is obviously a registered dealer under the Act. Besides the return on which tax has been assessed has been submitted by the appellant in Form No. III on the basis that he is a dealer. In other words, judging the character of the appellant in respect of the transactions in question solely by reference to the return, there could be no doubt that the appellant purports to be a dealer in respect of them and not an agent. It is really difficult to understand why the appellant should have included these transactions in his return at all if he had purchased the teas not for himself but as an agent on behalf of his Bombay principals. "Turnover" as defined by section 2(i) of the Act means "in relation to any period the aggregate of the sale prices or parts of sale prices receivable, or, if a dealer so elects, actually received by the dealer during such period"after making the permissible deductions; and a" dealer"under section 2, sub-section (c), means" a person who carries on the business of selling goods in West Bengal"	PetArg
Against this order an appeal was preferred by the appellant before the Assistant Commissioner but the appellate authority substantially agreed with the view taken by the Commercial Tax Officer and dismissed the appeal. According to the appellate authority, whoever might have physically put the goods in the hold of the ships, the consignors in the bills of lading, which were legal documents of dispatch, must be deemed to be the dispatchers. The appellate authority also held that it could not be disputed that the sales which occasioned the exports were the sales by the Bombay parties and as such there can be no question of the assessee's taking protection under Article 286(1)(b) of the Constitution.
, used by the learned Chief Justice in this judgment was subsequently explained by him when he delivered the majority judgment in the next Travancore case in The State of Travancore-Cochin and Others v. Shanmuga Vilas Cashew-Nut Factory and Others 1954 SCR 53; 1953 (4) STC 205). The phrase "integrated activities", observed the learned Chief Justice, "had been used in the previous decision to denote that 'such a sale' (that is to say a sale which occasions the export) cannot be dissociated from the export without which it cannot be effectuated and the sale and the resultant export form part of a single transaction. It is in that sense that the two activities, the sale and the export, were said to be integrated"
The same question has been recently considered by this Court in The State of Mysore v. The Mysore Spinning and Manufacturing Co., Ltd., and the Minerva Mills Ltd. (Civil Appeals Nos. 66 to 73 of 1957 - Judgment delivered on February 11, 1958; Since reported in 1958 (9) STC 188 ). There is no doubt that this decision clearly covers the case before us. Shri Veda Vyas could not seriously dispute this position. He, however, faintly attempted to argue that there are some aspects of the question to which attention of the Court was not drawn in the case of The State of Mysore etc. etc. (Civil Appeals Nos. 66 to 73 of 1957 - Judgment delivered on February 11, 1958; Since reported in 1958 (9) STC 188 ). We are, however, not impressed by this plea. We hold that, in view of the two Travancore decisions and particularly in view of the recent decision in The State of Mysore etc. etc. (Civil Appeals Nos. 66 to 73 of 1957 - Judgment delivered on February 11, 1958; Since reported in 1958 (9) STC 188 ), it would be impossible to accept the plea that the sale effected by the appellant in the present case can claim the protection of Article 286(1)(b) of the Constitution.
Shri Veda Vyas relied upon the decision of the Bombay High Court in M/s. Daulatram Rameshwarlal v. B. K. Wadeyar 1957 (8) STC 617; 1958 AIR(Bom)
120) as well as the decision of the Madras High Court in Gandhi Sons, Ltd. v. The State of Madras 1955 (6) STC 694 ). We are satisfied that these decisions do not support the appellant's case. In the case of M/s. Daulatram Rameshwarlal v. B. K. Wadeyar 1957 (8) STC 617; 1958 AIR(Bom)
120), the Bombay High Court found that the exporter got the delivery of the goods by means of the documents of title after they had crossed the customs barrier and so it was impossible to suggest that he could have made any other use of the goods except exporting them outside India. The appropriation in the said case was conditional upon the payment being made by the exporters on the presentation of the bills of lading and, therefore, it was clear that the sellers wanted to keep the power of disposal over the goods till they had received the payment from the exporters. The facts in the present case, however, are entirely different. Similarly, in the case of Gandhi Sons, Ltd. v. The State of Madras 1955 (6) STC 694 ), the Madras High Court had held that the property in question did not pass to the buyers until the relevant bills of lading were presented to the buyers or, in any event, at least not until the goods were put on board the vessel at Cochin harbour. In this case again the facts found are very different from the facts before us. We wish to point out that we do not propose to consider the correctness of the conclusions reached by the learned Judges in both these decisions. For the purpose of the present appeal it is enough to state that these cases, even if they are assumed to be correctly decided, do not support the appellant's contention.In the result the appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs.
Before we part with this appeal, we may refer to one point which has been mentioned by Chakravartti, C.J., in his judgment under appeal. The learned Chief Justice has observed that the appellant had not fully availed himself of the remedies open under the Act. In fact he had preferred an appeal against the original order passed by the Commercial Tax Officer but had not cared to file a revision application against the appellate order. "To my mind", observes the learned Chief Justice, "the case where the only fact to consider is the mere existence of alternative remedy and the case where the alternative remedy has in fact been availed of but not availed of in full stand on different footings."	Precedent
The learned Chief Justice thought that if the competence of the application for a writ had been challenged in the original Court on this technical ground, speaking for himself, he would have been inclined to consider it more seriously. In the present case we do not propose to express any opinion on this point.
Civil Appeal No. 665 of 1957 has been filed by the same appellant against the order of assessment passed by the Commercial Tax Officer, Calcutta, in respect of the appellant's turnover for the subsequent year 1950-51. The appellant has been assessed to sales tax for Rs. 27, 194-4-9 and the validity of this order is sought to be challenged on the same grounds on which the validity of the order for the previous year was challenged in Civil Appeal No. 300 of 1956. In view of our decision in Civil Appeal No. 300 of 1956, Civil Appeal No. 665 of 1957 also must fail. Shri Veda Vyas requested us to send this appeal back to the appellate authority under the Act with the direction that the merits of the contentions raised by the appellant should be dealt with by the appellate authority. We are not inclined to adopt this course. If the appellant did not pursue his remedy available under the Act and failed to make an appeal in proper time, we see no reason why were should show him special indulgence and send this matter to the appellate authority with the directions as suggested by Shri Veda Vyas.In the result this appeal also fails and must be dismissed with costs.	Conclusion
JUDGMENT with Civil Appeal No. 665 of 1957 1958 AIR (SC) 1006 The Judgment was delivered by GAJENDRAGADKAR, J. :

The appellant was also told that the shipment should be in the name of the said Bombay party. Even as to packing, instructions were given by the Bombay party on 7th January, 1950. The appellant was told to pack all goods by single gunny and cross wire and that the marking should be clean. On 15th November, 1949, a letter from the said Bombay party said "Out of our purchased stock please make two blends according to the attached blend list and ship after packing and marking as directed in the list"
