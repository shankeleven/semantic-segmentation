CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 120 of 1955. Appeal from the judgment and decree dated March 25, 1949, of the Madras High Court in Appeal No. 55 of 1946, arising out of the judgment and decree dated November 26, 1945, of the Court of the District Judge of Bellary in Original Suit No. 39 of 1943.
K.N. Rajagopala Sastri and M. S. K. Sastri, for the respondents.
Kari Veerappa was the last male owner of the estate mentioned in his will, Exbt. P-2(a), which he executed on October 10, 1920. Under this will he authorised his wife Setra Veeravva, first defendant, to adopt a son for the purpose of continuation of his family as he had no issue. The authority to adopt was in the following terms:	Issue
A. V. Viswanatha Sastri and K. R. Chaudhury for B. K. B. Naidu, for the appellant.
It was strongly urged on behalf of the appellant that the words " any property possessed by a female Hindu " in s. 14 of the Act referred to actual possession of the property whether the property was acquired before or after the Act came into force. This was a condition precedent to the applicability of the provisions of s. 14 to the present case. Since the Act came into force on June 17, 1956, and the decision of the High Court was given on March 25, 1955, the question as to who was in actual possession of the estate of Veerappa did not arise for consideration on the case of the appellant set out in his plaint. The appellant should accordingly be given an opportunity to have a finding recorded on this question after the taking of evidence in that respect.

On behalf of the appellant it was urged that s. 14 of the Act did not apply to the facts of the present case because the estate of Veerappa was not in possession of his widow Veeravva but was in possession of the second defendant at the time the Act came into force and, secondly, because under sub-s. (2) of s. 14 Veeravva got a restricted estate under the will Exbt. P-2(a) and the agreement to adopt, Exbt. D-25. It was submitted that the widow , s power of adoption did not depend on her ownership of the estate of her husband. That power in the present case was derived under the Hindu law either from the authority conferred by her husband or the consent of his agnates. The Act did not enlarge her power of adoption and did not render an invalid adoption made by her immune from attack by the reversioners during her life time. The act of Veeravva in the present case was to bring in a stranger. The appellant as a rever- sioner was, therefore, entitled during the life time of Veeravva to bring the present suit to obtain a declaration that the adoption of the second defendant was invalid. The question raised by the preliminary objection taken by the respondents must be considered an the assumption that the adoption of the second defendant was invalid. The provisions of a. 14 of the Act would not arise for consideration, if the second defendant had been validly adopted. It is necessary, therefore, to determine whether the provisions of s. 14 apply to the facts of the present case.	RespArg
1958. December 19. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by IMAM, J.-This appeal is before us on a certificate granted by the High Court as according to that Court a substantial question of law arose in the case which was stated by it to be " Is the adoption of the second defendant invalid, as the approval or consent of the five trustees mentioned in paragraph 14 of the will of Kari Veerappa, Exbt. P-2(a) was not obtained; and is the authority to adopt at an end if any one of those five persons did not accept the trusteeship or died before the adoption or refused to give their approval ". In view of certain matters about to be stated, the question of law as propounded by the High Court does not require to be considered.
Explanation.-In this sub-section, " property" includes both movable and immovable property acquired by a female Hindu by inheritance or devise, or at a partition, or in lieu of maintenance or arrears of maintenance, or by gift from any person, whether a relative or not, before, at or after her marriage, or by her own skill or exertion, or by purchase or by prescription, or in any other manner whatsoever, and also any such property held by her as stridhana immediately before the commencement of this Act.
Harak Singh v. KailaSh Singh (1) overruled its previous decisions referred to above, and rightly pointed out that the object of the Act was to improve the legal status of Hindu women, enlarging their limited interest in property inherited or held by them to an absolute interest, provided they were in possession of the property when the Act came into force and, therefore, in a position to take advantage of its beneficial provisions; but the Act was not intended to benefit alienees who with their eyes open purchased the property from the limited owners without justifying necessity before the Act came into force and at a time when the vendors had only a limited interest of Hindu women. In the case before us, the essential question for con- sideration is as to how the words "any property possessed by a female Hindu, whether aquired before or after the commencement of this Act " in a. 14 of the Act should be interpreted. Section 14 refers to property which was either acquired before or after the commencement of the Act and that such property should be possessed by a female Hindu. Reference to property acquired before the commencement of the Act certainly makes the provisions of the section re- trospective, but even in such a case the property must be possessed by a female Hindu at the time the Act came into force in order to make the provisions of the section applicable. There is no question in the present case that Veeravva acquired the property of her deceased husband before the commencement of the Act. In order that the provisions of s. 14 may apply to the present case it will have to be further established that the property was possessed by her at the time the Act came into force. It was the case of the appellant that the estate of Veerappa was in actual possession of the second defendant and not Veeravva at the relevant time. On behalf of the respondent it was urged that the words " possessed by " had a wider meaning than actual physical possession, although physical possession may be included in the expression. (1) A.I.R. 1958 Pat. 581.
In the case of Gaddam Venkayamma v. Gaddam Veerayya (1) Viswanatha Sastri, J., with whom Satyanarayana Raju, J., agreed, expressed the opinion that "the word ' possessed' in s. 14 refers to possession on the date when the Act came into force. course, possession referred to in s. 14 need not be actual physical possession or personal occupation of the property by the Hindu female-but may be possession in law. The possession of a licensee, lessee or a mortgagee from the female owner or the possession of a guardian or a trustee or an agent of the female owner would be her possession for the purpose of s. 14. The word " possessed " is used in s. 14 in a broad sense and in the context possession means the state of owning or having in one's hands or power. it includes possession by receipt of rents and profits. " The learned Judges expressed the view that even if a trespasser were in possession of the land belonging to a female owner, it might conceivably be regarded as being in possession of the female owner, provided the trespasser had not perfected his title. We do not think that it is necessary in the present case to go to the extent to which the learned Judges went. It is sufficient to say that possessed " in s. 14 is used in a broad sense and in the context means the state of owning or having in one's hand or power. In the case of Gostha Behari v. Haridas Samanta (2), P. N. Mookherjee, J., expressed his opinion as to the meaning of the words " any property possessed by a female Hindu " in the following words:-
absolute estate under this particular section, was at least in such possession, taking the word " possession " in its widest connotation, when the Act came into force, the section would not apply-".
In our opinion, the view expressed above is the correct view as to how the words " any property possessed by a female Hindu " should be interpreted. In the present case if the adoption was invalid, the full owner of Veerappa's estate was his widow Veeravva and even if it be assumed that the second defendant was in actual possession of the estate his possession was merely permissive and Veeravva must be regarded as being in constructive possession of it through the second defendant. In this situation, at the time when the Act came into force, the property of Veerappa must be regarded in law as being possessed by Veeravva. It was suggested that according to the will of Veerappa, Exbt. P_2(a), in the properties mentioned in para. 1-of that will, Veeravva got only a restricted estate. The provisions of para. 4 of the will, however, make it clear that they would come into force only if the trustees mentioned in the will and Veeravva should disagree. No material was shown to us that, in fact, the trustees and Veeravva had disagreed and that the provisions of para. 4 were given effect to. Paragraph 12 of the will also showed that if the adoption was invalid, the property devolved on Veeravva as in intestacy. It is clear, therefore, that the provisions of para. 4 are of no assistance to the appellant in applying the provisions of sub-s. (2) of s. 14 of the Act. Reference was also made to the contents of the agreement, Exbt. D - 25, dated September 18, 1942, in this connection. It is clear.' however, that by this agreement no estate was conferred on Veeravva and she did not thereby acquire any estate, much less a restricted estate. All that this document stated was that there was an agreement between the guardians of the boy to be adopted and Veeravva that even if the boy is adopted, Veeravva would remain in possession and enjoyment of her husband's estate during her life time. In our opinion, there is no material on the record by which it can reasonably be said that the provisions of sub-s. (2) of s. 14 of the Act applied to the present case.	Precedent
(2)Nothing contained in sub-section (1) shall apply to any property acquired by way of gift or under a will or any other instrument or under a decree or order of a civil court or under an award where the terms of the gift, will or other instrument or the decree, order or award prescribe a restricted estate in such property."
It was urged that the act of Veeravva in adopting the second defendant was to bring in a stranger and this action of hers could be questioned by a reversioner, as any alienation made by her, during her life time. Reference was made to s. 42 of the Specific Relief Act, Illustration (f). In our opinion, this is of no avail to the appellant, because Illustration (f) obviously refers to a Hindu widow's estate and has no reference to a full owner. The right of a reversioner as one of the heirs under s. 42, Specific Relief Act, is limited to the question of preserving the estate of a limited owner for the benefit of the entire body of reversioners; but as against a full owner, the reversioner has no such right. In our opinion, under the Act Veeravva becoming a full owner of her husband's estate, the suit could not succeed and the appeal must accordingly fail. In our opinion, the appellant's suit was not maintainable, having regard to the provisions of s. 14 of the Act, even if it be assumed that there was no valid adoption of the second defendant. The appeal accordingly fails and is dismissed with costs.	Section
