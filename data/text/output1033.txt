Chaube Jagdish Prasad And Another vs Ganga Prasad Chaturvedi on 5 December, 1958	Case Title
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 153 of 1955. Appeal by Special Leave from the judgment and decree dated August 30, 1954, of the Allahabad High Court in Civil Revision Application No. 540 of 1951, arising out of the judgment and decree dated March 31, 1951, of the Court of the Additional Civil Judge, Mathura, in Suit No. 19 of 1950. G. C. Mathur, for the appellants.
C. B. Aggarwala and Ganpat Rai, for the respondent. 1958. December 5. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR, J.-This is an appeal by special leave against the decision of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad passed in revision under s. 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The landlord who was the plaintiff in the trial court is the appellant before us and the tenant who was the defendant is the respondent.	Issue
The facts of this appeal are that in 1938 the respondent took on rent the accommodation in dispute which is termed a ' tal' on a monthly agreed rent of Rs. 21-4 as. and was using the same for the purpose of stacking timber. A portion of it was a covered godown which had three walls and a kucha roof. On January 28, 1950, the appellant made an application to the House Allotment Officer under s. 3-A of the United Provinces (Temporary) Control of Rent and Eviction Act, 1947 (U. P. III of 1947) (hereinafter termed the Act) for the fixation of " reasonable annual rent " of the accommodation in dispute. He therein alleged that in January 1949 he had " constructed anew " a big godown 80 x 25 x 11 feet according to the instructions of the respondent and expended a fairly large sum of money on it and was therefore entitled to a monthly rent of Rs. 165. The House Allotment Officer fixed on February 18, 1950, the rent at Rs. 35 per mensem which on review was raised on May 25, 1950, to Rs. 40 per mensem. He held that the accommodation was not a newly constructed accommodation as the respondent had been a tenant from 1938. He determined the increase of rent on the basis of the building that was added by the new construction. He also held that:
The appellant thereupon instituted a suit on the ground of inadequacy of the reasonable annual rent under s. 5(4) of the Act alleging that he had constructed the portion of the accommodation " anew " and put up ferro-concrete roof 80 x 25 feet and that the construction was undertaken at the request of the respondent who had agreed to pay enhanced rent but had refused to do so; that although the House Allotment officer, Mathura, had fixed the rent of the accommodation at Rs. 35 which wag subsequently raised to Rs. 40 per mensem, the proper rent should not be less than Rs. 115 per mensem and therefore prayed for the enhancement of "
The learned Additional Civil Judge found that the suit was not barred because of the Act; that the suit against the order of the House Allotment Officer was maintainable; that newly constructed accommodation on the whole was bigger and more spacious than the old kacha hall and that the accommodation had increased and after taking into consideration the amount spent on the construction be increased the " reasonable adequate rent " to Rs. 55-8-0. Against this decree of the learned Judge the respondent took a revision to the High Court under s. 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The High Court was of the opinion that if the accommodation was a new construction erected after June 30, 1946, the suit was maintainable and- the High Court could not interfere with the finding of the Civil Judge as to the amount of rent. If on the other hand, the construction was an old one, the suit did not lie and the agreed rent would continue to be payable. It also held that the construction on the upper storey was a new construction but as far as the accommodation in the occupation of the respondent was concerned the construction could not be called new construction and therefore B. 3-A was not applicable and as no suit lay at the instance of the landlord to have the agreed rent enhanced, the tenant was only liable to pay the agreed rent and no more. The revision petition was therefore allowed and the suit of the appellant was dismissed.
These observations which relate to inferior courts or tribunals with limited jurisdiction show that there are two classes of cases dealing with the power of such a tribunal (1) where the legislature entrusts a tribunal with the jurisdiction including the jurisdiction to determine whether the preliminary state of facts on which the exercise of its jurisdiction depends exists and (2) where the legislature confers jurisdiction on such tribunals to proceed in a case where a certain state of facts exists or is shown to exist. The difference is that in the former case the tribunal has power to determine the facts giving it jurisdiction and in the latter case it has only to see that a certain state of facts exists. In the present case the appellant asked for a determination of reasonable annual rent under s. 3-A on the ground that the accommodation was constructed after June 30, 1946, and the House Allotment Officer therefore had power to determine the reasonable annual rent.	Facts
The main controversy raised between the parties was whether the High Court could, in revision under S. 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, interfere with this decision of the trial court. The respective contentions were these: The appellant contended that it was within the jurisdiction of the Additional Civil Judge to decide the question of the date of construction of the accommodation and in doing so he could decide rightly or wrongly as the matter was within his jurisdiction and therefore the High Court had no power to interfere merely because in its opinion the decision was erroneous. In other words, this question was -merely one of the facts in issue between the parties unconnected with jurisdiction. He also contended that the House Allotment Officer having decided in his favour the question of the date of construction which s. 3-A of the Act authorises him to decide, his right to bring the suit was established and therefore the High Court could not in revision under s. 115, Code of Civil Procedure, go into the correctness of that decision. The respondent's counsel on the other hand submitted that the decision of the court as to the date of construction was in this case a jurisdictional fact i.e. a fact which went to the root of the jurisdiction of the court because unless the accommodation was held to have been a new construction made after June 30, 1946, the appellant would be bound by the agreed rent and would have no right of suit under s. 5(4) and the court would have no jurisdiction to entertain the suit. In order to decide the question at issue, it is necessary at this stage to refer to the scheme of the Act. The object of the Act was to control letting and the rents of residential and nonresidential accommodations.
(i)but was held by a tenant on rent between April 1, 1942, and June 30, 1946, fifteen times the rent for the one month nearest to and after April 1, 1942, and
(ii)if it was not so held on rent, the amount determined under section 3-A and in the case of accommodation constructed on or after July 1, 1946, means the rent determined in accordance with section 3-A ".
As to how reasonable annual rent of a building was to be determined was provided for in s. 3-A:
Section 6 provided for the procedure as follows (1) " In determining the amount of annual or monthly rent in any suit under section 5 the court shall take into account-
The High Court, in our view, approached the question quite correctly when it stated that the question for determination was whether the accommodation had been constructed before or after June 30, 1946, and that if it was constructed before that date the suit was incompetent and if after, the suit would lie. The contention raised by the appellant in this Court was that the decision of the trial Court as to whether the accommodation was constructed before or after July 1, 1946, cannot be challenged in revision in the High Court and he relied on the following observation of Lord Esher, M. R., in the Queen v. Commissioner for Special Purposes of the Income Tax (1):-
In order to give jurisdiction to the civil court there bad to be in existence a reasonable annual rent as defined under s. 2(f) whether it fell within its first two clauses or was determined under s. 3-A. The reason. able annual rent could be varied at the instance of the landlord or the tenant on the ground of its inadequacy or excess but the landlord could not. bring a suit to vary the agreed rent nor could the court entertain such a suit although it was open to the tenant to do so and the court could at his instance entertain such a suit. The proceedings before the civil court are not by way of an appeal from any order under s. 3-A made by the District Magistrate.
Section 115, Code of Civil Procedure, empowers the High Court, in cases where no appeal lies, to satisfy itself on three matters:- (a) that the order made by the subordinate court is within its jurisdiction; (b) that the case is one in which the court ought to exercise its jurisdiction; (e) that in exercising the jurisdiction the court has not acted illegally, that is, in breach of some provision of law or with material irregularity that is by committing some error of procedure in the course of the trial which is material in that it may have affected the ultimate decision. Per Sir John Beaumont in Venkatagiri Ayyangar v. Hindu Religious Endowment Board, Madras (1). Therefore if an erroneous decision of a subordinate court resulted in its exercising jurisdiction not vested in it by law or failing to exercise the jurisdiction so vested or acting with material irregularity or illegality in the exercise of its jurisdiction the case for the exercise of powers of revision by the High Court is made out. In Joy Chand Lal Babu v. Kamalaksha Chaudhury (2), the subordinate court gave an erroneous decision that the loan was a commercial loan and therefore refused to exercise jurisdiction vested in it by law and the Privy Council held that it was open to the High Court to interfere in revision under s. 115. Sir John Beaumont said at p. 142:
(c) can be ignored. The cases of Babu Ram v. Munnalal (1) and Hari Bhikaji v. Naro Vishvanath (2), may be mentioned as cases in which a subordinate court by its own erroneous decison (erroneous, that is, in the view of the High Court), in the one case on a point of limitation and in the other on a question of res judicata, invested itself with a jurisdiction which in law it did not possess; and the High Court held, wrongly their Lordships think, that it had no power to interfere in revision to prevent such a result. In the present case their Lordships are of opinion that the High Court, on the view which it took that the loan was not a commercial loan, had power to interfere in revision under sub-s. (b) of s. 115 ".
In Keshardeo Chamria v. Radha Kissen Chamria (3) both these judgments of the Privy Council as also the previous judgments in Rajah Amir Hassan Khan v. Sheo Baksh Singh (4 ) and Balakrishna Udayar v. Vasudeva Aiyar (5) were reviewed and it was held that s. 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure applies to matters of jurisdiction alone, the irregular exercise or non exercise of it or the illegal assumption of it. Thus if a subordinate court had jurisdiction to make the order it made and has not acted in breach of any provision of law or committed any error of procedure which is material and may have affected the ultimate decision, then the High Court has no power to interfere. But if on the other hand it decides a jurisdictional fact erroneously and thereby assumes jurisdiction not vested in it or deprives itself of jurisdiction so vested then the power of interference under s. 115 becomes operative. The appellant also relied on Rai Brij Raj Krishna v. S. K. Shaw and Bros. (6) where this Court quoted with approval the observations of Lord Esher in Queen v. Commissioner for Special Purposes of the Income Tax(7) and The Colonial Bank of Australia v. Willan where Sir James Co] ville said :-	Precedent
(2)if it is a part only of the accommodation so assessed, the proportionate amount of the municipal assessment of such accommodation plus 25 per cent. thereon ;
(3) if it is not assessed to municipal assessment-
section (4) of section 5, the rent fixed by the District Magistrate under this section shall be the annual reasonable rent of the accommodation."
Section 5(4) of the Act provided:
(b)in the case of accommodation constructed on or after July 1, 1946, the cost of construction and of maintenance and repairs of accommodation, its situation and any other circumstance which the court may consider material. (2)No appeal shall lie from any decree or order of the Munsiff or the Civil Judge in a suit brought under sub- section (4) of section 5:
or failing to exercise a jurisdiction so vested, a case for revision arises under sub-s. (a) or sub.s. (b), and subs.	Section
they also have to consider, whatever jurisdiction they give them, whether there shall be any appeal from their decision, for otherwise there will be none. In the second of the two cases I have mentioned it is an erroneous application of the formula to say that the tribunal cannot give themselves jurisdiction by wrongly deciding certain facts to exist, because the legislature gave them jurisdiction to determine all the facts, including the existence of the preliminary facts on which the further exercise of their jurisdiction depends; and if they were given jurisdiction so to decide, without any appeal being given, there is no appeal from such exercise of their jurisdiction.
But these observations can have no application to the judgment of the Additional Civil Judge whose jurisdiction in the present case is to be determined by the provisions of s. 5(4) of the Act. And the power of the High Court to correct questions of jurisdiction is to be found within the four corners of s. 115. If there is an error which falls within this section the High Court will have the power to interfere, not otherwise.
The only question to be decided in the instant case is as to whether the High Court had correctly interfered under s. 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure with the order of the Civil Judge. As we have held above, at the instance of the landlord the suit was only maintainable if it was based on the inadequacy of the reasonable annual rent and for that purpose the necessary jurisdictional fact to be found was the date of the construction of the accommodation and if the court wrongly decided that fact and thereby conferred jurisdiction upon itself which it did not possess, it exercised jurisdiction not vested in it and the matter fell within the rule laid down by the Privy Council in Joy Chandlal Babu v. Kamalaksha Chaudhury (1). The High Court had the power to interfere and once it had the power it could determine whether the question of the date of construction was rightly or wrongly decided. The High Court held that the Civil Judge had wrongly decided that the construction was of a date after June 30, 1946, and therefore fell within s. 3-A. In these circumstances the appeal must fail and is dismissed with costs throughout.
Appeal dismissed.

CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 153 of 1955. Appeal by Special Leave from the judgment and decree dated August 30, 1954, of the Allahabad High Court in Civil Revision Application No. 540 of 1951, arising out of the judgment and decree dated March 31, 1951, of the Court of the Additional Civil Judge, Mathura, in Suit No. 19 of 1950. G. C. Mathur, for the appellants.
C. B. Aggarwala and Ganpat Rai, for the respondent. 1958. December 5. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR, J.-This is an appeal by special leave against the decision of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad passed in revision under s. 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The landlord who was the plaintiff in the trial court is the appellant before us and the tenant who was the defendant is the respondent.

A portion of it was a covered godown which had three walls and a kucha roof.

The House Allotment Officer fixed on February 18, 1950, the rent at Rs. 35 per mensem which on review was raised on May 25, 1950, to Rs. 40 per mensem. He held that the accommodation was not a newly constructed accommodation as the respondent had been a tenant from 1938. He determined the increase of rent on the basis of the building that was added by the new construction. He also held that:
The appellant thereupon instituted a suit on the ground of inadequacy of the reasonable annual rent under s. 5(4) of the Act alleging that he had constructed the portion of the accommodation " anew " and put up ferro-concrete roof 80 x 25 feet and that the construction was undertaken at the request of the respondent who had agreed to pay enhanced rent but had refused to do so; that although the House Allotment officer, Mathura, had fixed the rent of the accommodation at Rs. 35 which wag subsequently raised to Rs. 40 per mensem, the proper rent should not be less than Rs. 115 per mensem and therefore prayed for the enhancement of "
The learned Additional Civil Judge found that the suit was not barred because of the Act; that the suit against the order of the House Allotment Officer was maintainable; that newly constructed accommodation on the whole was bigger and more spacious than the old kacha hall and that the accommodation had increased and after taking into consideration the amount spent on the construction be increased the " reasonable adequate rent " to Rs. 55-8-0. Against this decree of the learned Judge the respondent took a revision to the High Court under s. 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The High Court was of the opinion that if the accommodation was a new construction erected after June 30, 1946, the suit was maintainable and- the High Court could not interfere with the finding of the Civil Judge as to the amount of rent. If on the other hand, the construction was an old one, the suit did not lie and the agreed rent would continue to be payable. It also held that the construction on the upper storey was a new construction but as far as the accommodation in the occupation of the respondent was concerned the construction could not be called new construction and therefore B. 3-A was not applicable and as no suit lay at the instance of the landlord to have the agreed rent enhanced, the tenant was only liable to pay the agreed rent and no more. The revision petition was therefore allowed and the suit of the appellant was dismissed.
The main controversy raised between the parties was whether the High Court could, in revision under S. 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, interfere with this decision of the trial court. The respective contentions were these: The appellant contended that it was within the jurisdiction of the Additional Civil Judge to decide the question of the date of construction of the accommodation and in doing so he could decide rightly or wrongly as the matter was within his jurisdiction and therefore the High Court had no power to interfere merely because in its opinion the decision was erroneous.

In order to decide the question at issue, it is necessary at this stage to refer to the scheme of the Act. The object of the Act was to control letting and the rents of residential and nonresidential accommodations.
(2)if it is a part only of the accommodation so assessed, the proportionate amount of the municipal assessment of such accommodation plus 25 per cent. thereon ;
(3) if it is not assessed to municipal assessment-
(i)but was held by a tenant on rent between April 1, 1942, and June 30, 1946, fifteen times the rent for the one month nearest to and after April 1, 1942, and
(ii)if it was not so held on rent, the amount determined under section 3-A and in the case of accommodation constructed on or after July 1, 1946, means the rent determined in accordance with section 3-A ".
As to how reasonable annual rent of a building was to be determined was provided for in s. 3-A:
section (4) of section 5, the rent fixed by the District Magistrate under this section shall be the annual reasonable rent of the accommodation."
Section 5(4) of the Act provided:
Section 6 provided for the procedure as follows (1) " In determining the amount of annual or monthly rent in any suit under section 5 the court shall take into account-
(a)in the case of accommodation constructed before July 1, 1946, the pre-war rent, the reasonable annual or monthly rent, the prevailing rent on the date of the suit for similar accommodation in the locality, the cost of maintenance and repairs of such accommodation and any material circumstances proved by the plaintiff or the defendant,
(b)in the case of accommodation constructed on or after July 1, 1946, the cost of construction and of maintenance and repairs of accommodation, its situation and any other circumstance which the court may consider material. (2)No appeal shall lie from any decree or order of the Munsiff or the Civil Judge in a suit brought under sub- section (4) of section 5:
Two facts therefore stand out clearly in the judgment of the trial court (1) that it was the existence of a newly constructed accommodation which gave jurisdiction to the court to determine its reasonable annual rent and (2) that as it was a newly constructed accommodation, the question of agreed rent did not arise.
The High Court, in our view, approached the question quite correctly when it stated that the question for determination was whether the accommodation had been constructed before or after June 30, 1946, and that if it was constructed before that date the suit was incompetent and if after, the suit would lie. The contention raised by the appellant in this Court was that the decision of the trial Court as to whether the accommodation was constructed before or after July 1, 1946, cannot be challenged in revision in the High Court and he relied on the following observation of Lord Esher, M. R., in the Queen v. Commissioner for Special Purposes of the Income Tax (1):-
