CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 353 of 1957.
Appeal by special leave from the judgment and decree dated November 1, 1955, of the Punjab High Court (Circuit Bench) at Delhi in Regular Second Appeal No. 28-D of 1955, arising out of the judgment and decree dated December 31, 1954, of the Court of the Senior Subordinate Judge at Delhi in Regular Civil Appeal No. 685 of 1954, affirming the judgment and decree of Subordinate Judge Third Class Delhi in Suit No. 273/213 of 1953.
(1) Civil Appeal No. 65 Of 1957, decided on November 1, 1957.	Issue
1957. December 13. The following Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS C. J.-This appeal by special leave granted by this Court to the plaintiff-appellant is directed against the judgment and decree passed on November 1, 1955, by a single Judge of the Punjab High Court sitting in the Circuit Bench at Delhi in regular second appeal No. 28-D of 1955. The facts leading up to the present appeal are shortly as follows: On April 6, 1943, the appellant was appointed a sub-inspector under the Delhi Audit Fund. In February 1947, he was transferred to the Co-operative Societies Department and posted as subinspector in the Milk Scheme. On July 3, 1947, the the appellant was confirmed by the then Deputy Commissioner of Delhi who was also the ex-officio Registrar of Co-operative Societies. On August 1, 1948, the appellant was transferred to the Rehabilitation Department of the Co- operative Societies and posted as sub-inspector. On July 1, 1949, the appellant was suspended by the then Deputy Commissioner, Delhi. On July 9, 1949, the appellant was served with a charge sheet under r. 6(1) of the Rules which had been framed by the Chief Commissioner, Delhi to provide for the appointment to the subordinate services under his administrative control and the discipline and rights of appeal of members of those services. After formulating eight several charges the document concluded as follows: "	Facts

Then, after stating that a personal hearing was given to the appellant who raised the two points mentioned above and holding that there was no substance in either of them, paragraph 16 of the report ran as follows:	PetArg
C. K. Daphtary, Solicitor-General of India, R. Gana- pathy Iyer and R. H. Dhebar, for the respondents.
In our judgment neither of the two views can be accepted as a completely correct exposition of the intendment of the provisions of s. 240(3) of the Government of India Act, 1935, now embodied in Art. 311(2) of the Constitution. Indeed the learned Solicitor-General does riot contend that this provision is confined to guaranteeing to the government servant an opportunity to be given to him only at the later stage of showing cause against the punishment proposed to be imposed on him. We think that the learned Solicitor General is entirely right in not pressing for such a limited construction of the provisions under consideration. It is true that the provision does not, in terms, refer to different stages at which opportunity is to be given to the officer concerned. All that it says is that the government servant must be given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him. He must not only be given an opportunity but such opportunity must be a reasonable one. In order that the opportunity to show cause against the proposed action may be regarded as a reasonable one, it is quite obviously necessary that the government servant should have the opportunity, to say, if that be his case, that he has not been guilty of any misconduct to merit any punishment at all and also that the particular punish-	RespArg
311(1) No person who is a member of a civil service of the Union or an all-India service or a civil service of a State or holds a civil post under the Union or a State shall be dismissed or removed by an authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed.
The answer to the question canvassed before us depends on a true construction of the aforesaid pro,visions and in particular on the view we take as to the meaning, scope and ambit of Art. 311(2). In Parshotam Lal Dhingra's case (1) it wag said that the word "removed " was not in s. 240(3) but had been introduced in Art. 311(2). It may be mentioned that although the word " removed " was not actually used in s. 240(3), the reference to dismissal, according to s. 277, included a reference to removal.
Article 310(1) no doubt provides that every person falling within it holds office during the pleasure of the President or the Governor, as the case may be. The language of both cls. (1) and (2) of Art. 311 are prohibitory in form and was held by the Judicial Committee in High Commissioner for India v. 1. M. Lal (1) to be inconsistent with their being merely permissive and consequently those provisions have to be read as qualifications or provisos to Art. 310(1) as has been held by the Judicial Committee in that case and recently by this Court in Parshotam Lal Dhingra v. The Union of India(2) in a judgment pronounced on November 1, 1957. The limitations thus imposed on the exercise of the pleasure of the President or the Governor in the matter of the dismissal, removal or reduction in rank of government servants constitute the measure of the constitutional protection afforded to the government servants by Art. 311(2).
In exercise of powers conferred by s. 96-B(2) of the Government of India Act, 1915, the Secretary of State in Council framed Civil Service (Governors Provinces Classification) Rules. Rules (x) and (xiii) of those rules provided that local government might, for good and ,sufficient reasons, inflict the several punishments therein mentioned on persons therein indicated. Rule (xiv) prescribed the procedure for all cases in which dismissal, removal or reduction in rank of any officer was intended (1) L.R. (1948) 75 I.A. 225 at P. 241.
In R. Venkata Rao v. Secretary of State for India it was held, with reference to the rules made under s.96-B of the Government of India Act, 1915, that while that section assured that the tenure of office, though at pleasure, would not be subject to capricious and arbitrary action, but would be regulated by the rules, it gave no right to the appellant, enforceable by action, to hold his office in accordance with those rules. It was held that s. 96-B and the rules made thereunder only made provisions for the redress of grievances by administrative process. The position of the Government servant was, therefore, rather insecure, for his office being held during the pleasure of the Crown under the Government of India Act, 1915, the rules could not over-ride or derogate from the statute and the protection of the rules could not be enforced by action so as to nullify the statute itself. The only protection that the Government servants had was that, by virtue of s. 96- B(1), they could not be dismissed by an authority subordinate to that by which they were appointed. The position, however, improved to some extent under the 1935 Act which, by s. 240(3), gave a further protection, in addition to that provided in s. 240(2) which reproduced the protection of s 96-B(1) of the Government of India Act, 1915. We have, therefore, to determine the true meaning, scope and ambit of this now protection given by s. 240(3) of (1) L. R. (1936) 64 I.A. 55.
The majority of the Judges of the Federal Court (Spens, C.J., and Zafarulla Khan, J.) in I. M. Lall's case (1) took the view that in sub-s. (3) of s. 240 there had been enacted provisions of a very limited scope in permanent statutory form as compared with the provisions under the rules considered in Venkata Rao's case (2). Further down, after referring to the fact that prior to 1935 a sort of protection for the servants of the Crown provided by sub-s. (3) was merely to be found in the rules, many and various and liable to change, their Lordships proceeded to state that from those rules had been picked out and enacted in the section itself certain limited specific provisions only. The majority of the Federal Court at page 138 construed s. 240(3) as follows:
require any inquiry, any formulation of charges or any opportunity to defend against those charges ". According to them " all that it expressly requires is that where it is proposed to dismiss or reduce in rank a civil servant he should be given reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the proposal to dismiss or reduce him ".Their Lordships added that as that opportunity had to be a reasonable opportunity the section must be taken to require "not only notification of the action proposed but of the grounds on which the authority is proposing that the action should be taken and that the person concerned must then be given reasonable time to -make his representations against the proposed action and the grounds on which sit is proposed to be taken ". It is quite clear that the majority of the Federal Court put a somewhat narrow interpretation on the relevant provision in that they considered that the requirement of reasonable opportunity contemplated by it arose only at a later stage when the competent authority definitely proposed to take a particular action and that this opportunity did not cover the earlier stage where charges were formulated and enquired into. Varadachariar, J... in his dissenting judgment took much the same view on this point as did the High Court. The High Court observed as follows:
In agreement with the High Court Varadachariar J. held that the requirements of sub-s. (3) of s. 240 (1) (1944) I. L. R. 25 Lah. 325, 347, 348.	Precedent

Rule 49 of those rules specified seven different kinds of punishments which could, for good and sufficient reasons, be imposed upon the members of the services therein specified. Rule 55 reproduced old r. (xiv) with greater details. It provided:

1957. December 13. The following Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS C. J.-This appeal by special leave granted by this Court to the plaintiff-appellant is directed against the judgment and decree passed on November 1, 1955, by a single Judge of the Punjab High Court sitting in the Circuit Bench at Delhi in regular second appeal No. 28-D of 1955. The facts leading up to the present appeal are shortly as follows: On April 6, 1943, the appellant was appointed a sub-inspector under the Delhi Audit Fund.

After formulating eight several charges the document concluded as follows: "
Then, after stating that a personal hearing was given to the appellant who raised the two points mentioned above and holding that there was no substance in either of them, paragraph 16 of the report ran as follows:
The report also recommended that the appellant's gun licence be cancelled and that he be directed to surrender his licence and deposit the gun in the district Malkhana and that the money, which had been proved to have been taken by the appellant from various societies, might also be recovered from the security deposit furnished by him. There is no positive and definite statement in Shri J. B. Tandon's report that Shri Mahipal Singh had concluded the enquiry or submitted a formal report. The general tenor of Shri J. B. Tandon's report, however suggests that Shri Mahipal Singh did arrive, at definite findings on twelve charges. The appellant's grievance is that he was not given a copy of the report of Shri Mahipal Singh, if any had been made, and no such report has been exhibited in this case. At the foot of Shri J. B. Tandon's report the following endorsement appears over the signature of the Deputy Commissioner, Delhi under date December 14, 1951: " The report is approved. Action accordingly." Thereupon on December 17, 1951, a formal order was issued over the signature of the Deputy Commissioner, Delhi. It was in the following terms: -
311(1) No person who is a member of a civil service of the Union or an all-India service or a civil service of a State or holds a civil post under the Union or a State shall be dismissed or removed by an authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed.
(2)No such person as aforesaid shall be dismissed or removed or reduced in rank until he has been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him:
The answer to the question canvassed before us depends on a true construction of the aforesaid pro,visions and in particular on the view we take as to the meaning, scope and ambit of Art. 311(2). In Parshotam Lal Dhingra's case (1) it wag said that the word "removed " was not in s. 240(3) but had been introduced in Art. 311(2). It may be mentioned that although the word " removed " was not actually used in s. 240(3), the reference to dismissal, according to s. 277, included a reference to removal.
(1) Civil Appeal No. 65 Of 1957, decided on November 1, 1957.
Article 310(1) no doubt provides that every person falling within it holds office during the pleasure of the President or the Governor, as the case may be. The language of both cls. (1) and (2) of Art. 311 are prohibitory in form and was held by the Judicial Committee in High Commissioner for India v. 1. M. Lal (1) to be inconsistent with their being merely permissive and consequently those provisions have to be read as qualifications or provisos to Art. 310(1) as has been held by the Judicial Committee in that case and recently by this Court in Parshotam Lal Dhingra v. The Union of India(2) in a judgment pronounced on November 1, 1957. The limitations thus imposed on the exercise of the pleasure of the President or the Governor in the matter of the dismissal, removal or reduction in rank of government servants constitute the measure of the constitutional protection afforded to the government servants by Art. 311(2).
Clause (1) of Art. 311 is quite explicit and protects government servants of the kinds referred to therein by providing that they cannot be dismissed, or re. moved or reduced in rank by a lesser authority than that which appointed them. Likewise cl. (2) protects government servants against being dismissed, removed or reduced in rank without being given a reasonable opportunity to show cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to them. As has been explained by this Court in Parshotam Lal Dhingra's case (2), the expressions 'dismissed', 'removed' and ,reduced in rank' are technical words taken from the service rules where they are used to denote the three major categories of punishments.
In exercise of powers conferred by s. 96-B(2) of the Government of India Act, 1915, the Secretary of State in Council framed Civil Service (Governors Provinces Classification) Rules. Rules (x) and (xiii) of those rules provided that local government might, for good and ,sufficient reasons, inflict the several punishments therein mentioned on persons therein indicated. Rule (xiv) prescribed the procedure for all cases in which dismissal, removal or reduction in rank of any officer was intended (1) L.R. (1948) 75 I.A. 225 at P. 241.
to be ordered. These rules were reproduced with some modifications in the Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules which were, on May 27, 1930, ,promulgated by the Secretary of State in Council in exercise of the same powers under s. 96-B of the Government of India Act, 1915. Rule 49 of those rules specified seven different kinds of punishments which could, for good and sufficient reasons, be imposed upon the members of the services therein specified. Rule 55 reproduced old r. (xiv) with greater details. It provided:
Similar rules were framed and are to be found in the Indian Railway Establishment Code which governs the railway servants. Rule 6 of the Rules framed by the Chief Commissioner, Delhi, referred to above, is more or less on the same lines.
In R. Venkata Rao v. Secretary of State for India it was held, with reference to the rules made under s.96-B of the Government of India Act, 1915, that while that section assured that the tenure of office, though at pleasure, would not be subject to capricious and arbitrary action, but would be regulated by the rules, it gave no right to the appellant, enforceable by action, to hold his office in accordance with those rules. It was held that s. 96-B and the rules made thereunder only made provisions for the redress of grievances by administrative process. The position of the Government servant was, therefore, rather insecure, for his office being held during the pleasure of the Crown under the Government of India Act, 1915, the rules could not over-ride or derogate from the statute and the protection of the rules could not be enforced by action so as to nullify the statute itself. The only protection that the Government servants had was that, by virtue of s. 96- B(1), they could not be dismissed by an authority subordinate to that by which they were appointed. The position, however, improved to some extent under the 1935 Act which, by s. 240(3), gave a further protection, in addition to that provided in s. 240(2) which reproduced the protection of s 96-B(1) of the Government of India Act, 1915. We have, therefore, to determine the true meaning, scope and ambit of this now protection given by s. 240(3) of (1) L. R. (1936) 64 I.A. 55.
the Government of India Act, 1935, which has been reproduced in Art. 311(2).
The majority of the Judges of the Federal Court (Spens, C.J., and Zafarulla Khan, J.) in I. M. Lall's case (1) took the view that in sub-s. (3) of s. 240 there had been enacted provisions of a very limited scope in permanent statutory form as compared with the provisions under the rules considered in Venkata Rao's case (2). Further down, after referring to the fact that prior to 1935 a sort of protection for the servants of the Crown provided by sub-s. (3) was merely to be found in the rules, many and various and liable to change, their Lordships proceeded to state that from those rules had been picked out and enacted in the section itself certain limited specific provisions only. The majority of the Federal Court at page 138 construed s. 240(3) as follows:

According to them " all that it expressly requires is that where it is proposed to dismiss or reduce in rank a civil servant he should be given reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the proposal to dismiss or reduce him ".Their Lordships added that as that opportunity had to be a reasonable opportunity the section must be taken to require "not only notification of the action proposed but of the grounds on which the authority is proposing that the action should be taken and that the person concerned must then be given reasonable time to -make his representations against the proposed action and the grounds on which sit is proposed to be taken ". It is quite clear that the majority of the Federal Court put a somewhat narrow interpretation on the relevant provision in that they considered that the requirement of reasonable opportunity contemplated by it arose only at a later stage when the competent authority definitely proposed to take a particular action and that this opportunity did not cover the earlier stage where charges were formulated and enquired into. Varadachariar, J... in his dissenting judgment took much the same view on this point as did the High Court. The High Court observed as follows:
In agreement with the High Court Varadachariar J. held that the requirements of sub-s. (3) of s. 240 (1) (1944) I. L. R. 25 Lah. 325, 347, 348.
demanded nothing beyond what was required for compliance with the provisions of r. 55 of the Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules. His Lordship found nothing in the language of el. (3) to indicate that anything more or anything different was contemplated or to suggest that a further opportunity was to be given after the enquiry had been completed in the presence of the officer charged and the enquiring officer had made his report. The learned Judge was unable to accept the suggestion that the words of the statute were appropriate only to the stage when the authorities would be in a position to indicate definitely what action they intended to take, namely, whether it was to be one of dismissal or one of reduction and that this could be predicated only after the Enquiring Officer had made his report.
In our judgment neither of the two views can be accepted as a completely correct exposition of the intendment of the provisions of s. 240(3) of the Government of India Act, 1935, now embodied in Art. 311(2) of the Constitution. Indeed the learned Solicitor-General does riot contend that this provision is confined to guaranteeing to the government servant an opportunity to be given to him only at the later stage of showing cause against the punishment proposed to be imposed on him. We think that the learned Solicitor General is entirely right in not pressing for such a limited construction of the provisions under consideration. It is true that the provision does not, in terms, refer to different stages at which opportunity is to be given to the officer concerned. All that it says is that the government servant must be given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him. He must not only be given an opportunity but such opportunity must be a reasonable one. In order that the opportunity to show cause against the proposed action may be regarded as a reasonable one, it is quite obviously necessary that the government servant should have the opportunity, to say, if that be his case, that he has not been guilty of any misconduct to merit any punishment at all and also that the particular punish-
ment proposed to be given is much more drastic and severe than he deserves. Both these pleas have a direct bearing on the question of punishment and may well be put forward in showing cause against the proposed punishment. If this is the correct meaning of the clause, as we think it is, what consequences follow ? If it is open to the governmnet servant under this provision to contend, if that be the fact, that he is not guilty of any misconduct then how can he take that plea unless he is told what misconduct is alleged against him? If the opportunity to show cause is to be a reasonable one it is clear that he should be informed about the charge or charges levelled against him and the evidence by which it is sought to be established, for it is only then that he will be able to put forward his defence. If the purpose of this provision is to give the government servant an opportunity to exonerate himself from the charge and if this opportunity is to be a reasonable one he should be allowed to show that the evidence against him is not worthy of credence or consideration and that he can only do if he is given a chance to cross-examine the witnesses called against him and to examine himself or any other witness in support of his defence. All this appears to us to be implict in the language used in the clause, but this does not exhaust his rights. In addition to showing that he has not been guilty of any misconduct so as to merit any punishment, it is reasonable that he should also have an opportunity to contend that the charges proved against him do not necessarily require the particular punishment proposed to be meted out to him. He may say, for instance, that although he has been guilty of some misconduct it is not of such a character as to merit the extreme punishment of dismissal or even of removal or reduction in rank and that any of the lesser punishments ought to be sufficient in his case.
To summarise: the reasonable opportunity envisaged by the provision under consideration includes-
(a) An opportunity to deny his guilt and establish his innocence, which he can only do if he is told what the charges levelled against him are and the allegations on which such charges are based;
(b) an opportunity to defend himself by crossexamining the witnesses produced against him and by examining himself or any other witnesses in support of his defence; and finally
(c) an opportunity to make his representation as to why the proposed punishment should not be inflicted on him, which he can only do if the competent authority, after the enquiry is over and after applying his mind to the gravity or otherwise of the charges proved against the government servant tentatively proposes to inflict one of the three punishments and communicates the same to the government servant. In short the substance of the protection provided by rules, like r. 55 referred to above, was bodily lifted out of the rules and together with an additional opportunity embodied in s. 240 (3) of the Government of India Act, 1935 so as to give astatutory protection to the government servants and has now been incorporated in Art. 311 (2) so as to convert the protection into a constitutional safeguard. We find support for our above mentioned conclusion in the judgment of the Judicial Committee in I. M. Lall's case (1). It is true that after quoting a portion of the passage from the judgment of the majority of the Federal Court set out above their Lordships at page 242 stated that they agreed with the view taken by the majority of the Federal Court, but their Lordships did not stop there and went on to say:
opinion of their Lordships, no action is proposed within the meaning of the sub-section until a definite conclusion has been come to on the charges, and the actual punishment to follow is provisionally determined on. Before that stage, the charges are unproved and the suggested punishments are merely hypothetical. It is on that stage being reached that the statute gives the civil servant the opportunity for which sub-s. 3 makes provision. Their Lordships would only add that they see no difficulty in the statutory opportunity being reasonably afforded at more than one stage. If the civil servant has been through an inquiry under r. 55, it would not be reasonable that he should ask for a repetition of that stage, if duly carried out, but that would not exhaust his statutory right, and he would still be entitled to represent against the punishment proposed as the result of the findings of the inquiry."
The above passage quite clearly explains that the point on which their Lordships of the Judicial Committee agreed with the majority of the Federal Court is that a further opportunity is to be given to the government servant after the charges have been established against him and a, particular punishment is proposed to be meted out to him. The opening sentence in the above passage, namely, that s. 240 (3) was not a reproduction of r. 55 and that r. 55 was left unaffected as an administrative rule does seem to suggest that s. 240 (3) is not at all concerned with the enquiry into the charges which comes at the earlier stage, but a close reading of the rest of that passage will indicate that in their Lordships' view the substance of the protection of r. 55 is also included in s. 240 (3) and to that is superadded, by way of further protection, the neces- sity of giving yet another opportunity to the government servant at the stage where the charges are proved against him and a particular punishment is tentatively proposed to be inflicted on him. Their Lordships referred to "
would not exhaust his statutory right and he would still be entitled to make a representation against the punishment proposed as the result of the findings of the enquiry ". This clearly proceeds on the basis that the right to defend himself in the enquiry and the right to make representation against the proposed punishment are all parts of his "	Total Judgement
