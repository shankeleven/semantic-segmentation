CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 210 of 1959. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated January 16, 1958, of the Patna High Court in Mis. Judicial case No. 156 of 1957.

1960. November 7. The Judgment of Hidayatullah, Das Gupta and Ayyangar, JJ., was delivered by Ayyangar, J., and that of S. K. Das and Shah, JJ., was delivered by Shah, J. AYYANGAR. J.-The sole question which arises in this appeal, which comes by way of special leave is as to whether sales under which goods were delivered outside the State of Bihar for the purpose of consumption but not within the State of first delivery or first destination, are exempt from the levy of sales-tax by the Bihar State by virtue of Art. 286(1)(a) of the Constitution as it stood before the recent amendment.	Issue
The India Copper Corporation Ltd. (referred to hereafter as the assessee-company) carries on business in copper and various other materials and mineral pro. ducts and the office of its General Manager is in the district of Singhbhum in Bihar. The period covered by the assessment now in dispute is January 26, 1950 to March 31, 1950. The normal practice of the assessee-company was to deposit sums of money from time to time provisionally towards payment of sales-tax in advance and have the amount finally adjusted after the completion of the assessment of each year. The assessee-company followed this practice in respect of the amount of sales-tax due by it for the year 1949-50. For the financial year April 1, 1949 to March 31, 1950, the Superintendent of Sales-tax, Singhbhum, computed the tax liability of the company in the sum of Rs. 3,60,703-4-0 by an order of assessment dated November 13,1950, and the company made payment of the amount due by it beyond the sums already paid. It would be noticed that this financial year comprised two periods-(1) before the Constitution, viz., April 1, 1949 to January 25, 1950, and (2) the post-Constitution period from January 26, 1950 to March 31, 1950. There is now no controversy as regards the sales-tax payable in respect of sales effected during the pre-Constitution period. The assessee-company however raised a dispute that in respect of the post-Constitution period, it was not liable to pay any sales-tax in respect of sales to buyers, under which though the property in the goods passed within the State, delivery of the goods was effected outside the State of Bihar for consumption outside that State on the ground that such sales were exempted from tax by Art. 286(1)(a) of the Constitution as it originally stood. It addressed a formal letter to the Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, Bihar, on December 30, 1952, making this demand enclosing a statement showing full particulars of the goods sold, the bill numbers, the date and the amount etc., to enable the refund claimed to be calculated. The assessee-company followed it up by a formal petition for review of the assessment order by filing a revised return under s. 12(2) of the Bihar Sales-tax Act together with an application for refund. The departmental authorities rejected these applications by order dated July 20, 1953. Further proceedings before the department by way of revision etc. failed to secure to the assessee-company the relief which it claimed and thereafter it filed an application under Arts. 226 and 227 of the Constitution before the High Court of Patna praying for the issue of a writ to quash the order of assessment dated November 30, 1950, and the orders rejecting the prayers for review, reassessment and refund and for a direction to the departmental authorities to refund the sum realised by them in so far as the tax related to sales as a result of which goods were delivered outside the State of Bihar.	Facts
Three points were urged before us by Mr. B. C. Ghose, learned Counsel for the appellants: (1) that on a proper construction of Art. 286(1)(a) and the Explanation thereto (as it stood before the Article was amended by the Constitution Sixth Amendment Act, 1956) every sale as a direct result of which goods were delivered for consumption outside the State, was not within the taxing power of the State in which the goods were at the time of the sale, and ,in which property passed as a result thereof, and that it was immaterial whether the delivery was for the purpose of consumption in the State of first destination or whether the delivery in such State was not for the purpose of consumption therein but, for re-export to other States, (2) that even if Art. 286(1)(a) exempted only sales in which as a direct result of the sale the goods were delivered for the purpose of consumption in the State of first destination, on the pleadings and the evidence before the Court the assessee- company must be taken to have established that all the sales effected by it and in regard to which exemption from payment of tax was claimed, conformed to this requirement, (3) a narrower submission, that even it be that to fall within the Explanation the delivery has to be for the Purpose of consumption in the State of first destination, the learned Judges of the High Court erred in requiring the assessee- company to prove not merely that the goods were delivered for the purpose of consumption but further that the goods so delivered were actually consumed within that State. We shall now deal with these points in that order. Article 286(1)(a) together with the Explanation on whose construction the first point depends ran in these terms:
The second contention urged by the learned Counsel for the appellant was that even assuming he was wrong on the first point, all the sales by the assessee-company fell within the terms of the Explanation to Art. 286(1)(a) being sales as a direct result of which the goods were delivered for consumption in the State of first destination, and that the learned Judges of the High Court were in error in considering, that some of the sales did not conform to this requirement. In support of this submission learned counsel drew our attention to two matters. He first referred us to the application dated December 30, 1952 made on behalf of the assessee-company to the Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, Bihar, Patna in which the claim for refund of the tax paid was rested on the following ground :	PetArg
Explanation.-For the purposes of sub-clause (a) a sale or purchase shall be deemed to have taken place in the State in which the goods have actually been delivered as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of consumption in that State, notwithstanding the fact that under the general law relating to sale of goods the property in the goods has by reason of such sale or purchase passed in another State."
sale. It must however be pointed out that it was not disputed that the terms of the " Explanation " would not be satisfied unless the delivery was for the purpose of consumption therein, i.e. in the State of first destination, If the terms of the Explanation were satisfied, the State of " delivery. cum-consumption ", (to coin a convenient expression to designate the State in which goods are delivered as a direct result of the sale for the purpose of consumption therein), used in the Explanation, would have power to tax the sale as being one fictionally " inside "
If a single State was designed to have the power to tax any particular transaction of sale, the question that next falls to be considered is the determination of that State in regard to which it could be predicated that the sale in question was not " outside " that State or in other words, the determination of the particular State in regard to which it could be said that the sale was " inside " that State. The key to the problem is afforded by two indications in the Article itself: (1) the opening words of Article 286(1) which speak of a sale or purchase taking place and (2) the non-obstante clause in the Explanation which refers to the general law relating to " sale of goods under which property in the goods has, by reason of such sale or purchase, passed in another State." These two together indicate that it is the passing of property within the State that is intended to be fastened on, for the purpose of determining, whether the sale in question is " inside " or " outside " the State, and therefore, subject to the operation of the " Explanation "
of sale is only executory, and the buyer has only a chose in action................. The Constitution thinks in terms of a completed sale by the passing of property and not in terms of an executory contract for the sale of goods." Notwithstanding that is not an " outside " sale, the power of the State to tax might be negatived by the operation of the Explanation which by its non-obstante clause-shifts the situs of the sale and renders the sale transaction one within the delivery-cum-consumption State, i.e. as the State in which the sale transaction must be deemed to take place. Where the terms of the Explanation are satisfied, the sale transaction will, by a legal fiction created by it, be deemed to take place "inside" the State of delivery and therefore " outside " the State in which the property passes. The conclusion reached therefore is that where the property in the goods passes within a State as a direct result of the sale, the sale transaction is not outside the State for the purpose of Art. 286(1)(a), unless the Explanation operates. We need also add that the power of the State to impose the tax might still not be available unless the transaction in question is unaffected by the other bans imposed under sub-cl. (1)(b), (2) and (3) of Art.
Explanation:For the purposes of sub-cl. (a) a sale or purchase shall be deemed to have taken place in the State in which the goods have actually been delivered as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of consumption in that State notwithstanding the fact that under the general law relating to sale of goods the property in the goods has by reason of such sale or purchase passed in another State.
Bihar, but not as a direct result of the sale or not for the purpose of consumption in the State of first delivery, the sale will not be covered by the Explanation, and the right to tax the sale, if arising-otherwise under the Act relying upon the territorial nexus, will not be impaired by the prohibition imposed by cl. (1)(a)(i) of s. 33. The right of the State of Bihar to tax a sale relying upon a real territorial nexus not being impaired by s. 33 of the Act, all sales as defined by s. 2(g) of the Bihar Sales Tax Act are liable to be taxed, except those falling within s. 33(1)(a)(ii), s. 33(2) and " Explanation sales " outside the State of Bihar.	RespArg
The learned Judges of the High Court held that the order of the Superintendent of Sales-tax, Singhbhum, dated November 13, 1950, should be set aside and that the matter should go back to the Superintendent to make a reassessment according to law for the post Constitution period. A further direction was added requiring the respondent to refund to the assessee so much of the tax as had been paid in excess of the amount of reassessment to be made by the Superinten- dent in accordance with the law as laid down by the Court. In formulating the law applicable, the learned Judges drew a distinction between sales as a direct result of which goods were delivered in a State outside the State of Bihar and consumed in that State and those cases in which the goods thus delivered, were not consumed in the State of first destination but were re-exported from the State of first destination to other States. They held that the first category of sales were covered by the Explanation to Art. 286 (1)(a) of the Constitution and were " inside " the State of first delivery and consequently " outside " the State of Bihar within the meaning of the Article and therefore exempt from tax by the Bihar State. In regard, however, to the second category of sales, it was held that they were not within the Explanation and were therefore outside the constitutional exemption under Art. 286(1)(a). The assessee-company not being satisfied, filed an application to the High Court for a Certificate of fitness under Arts. 132 and 133 of the Constitution, but this having been rejected, they applied to and obtained special leave from this Court under Art. 136 of the Constitution and that is how the appeal is now before us.
The scope and the purpose of this Explanation was discussed and explained by this Court in The State of Bombay v. Unitea Motors (India) Ltd. (1) and it is the passage in this judgment extracted below on which reliance was placed by the learned Counsel in support of his submission:
It might be mentioned that this portion of the judgment is unaffected by the dissent expressed in the later decision in The Bengal Immunity Company Ltd. v. The State of Bihar (1). The argument based upon this passage was broadly on these lines: Article 286 (1)(a) imposes a ban on the legislative power to levy a tax on sales which are outside " the taxing State. What sales are " outside is not easy to decide because that depends upon " the situs " of a sale, which cannot, in most cases, be located in any one place with certainty-being dependent on a variety of factors which might or might not converge. The Constitution makers did not directly define what was meant by a ,sale that was "
in cases where goods were as a direct result of the sale delivered outside the State of Bihar for the purpose of consumption in the State of first destination, the conditions of the Explanation were satisfied and the sales being " outside " the State of Bihar could not be taxed by that State. So far there is no dispute and indeed the learned Judges of the High Court have, subject to a matter of detail to which reference will be made later, accepted the contention of the assessee. (2) a further consequence, that in cases where goods were delivered as a result of the sale outside the State of Bihar, but not for the purpose of consumption in such State of first destination, the terms of the Explanation were no doubt not satisfied and consequently the, sale was not inside such State of delivery and indeed not " inside " any State in India within the Explanation, but that such sales also must be held to be " outside "
As already pointed out, the situs of a sale is not easy to determine and several factors which constitute a completed transaction of sale including the delivery of the goods, lay claim to be considered as in themselves constituting sufficient next to justify their being treated as determining the locus of a sale. Thus, merely by way of illustration, the place where the goods are at the time of the contract of sale, the place where the contract of sale is concluded, the place where the property in the goods passes and that in which the delivery takes place compete for recognition as constituting the locus of a sale. Before the Constitution, these and other similar factors were treated as affording sufficient territorial connection to endow the State in which any of the events occurred with legislative competence to tax the sale. This led to a multiplicity of the taxation of the same transaction of sale by a plurality of States, with the result that the consumer was hard hit and trade itself, and national economy suffered in the process. It has been pointed out that Art. 286(1)(a) was designed to counteract that state of affairs.
286. The submission therefore of learned Counsel for the appellants, that in respect of non-Explanation sales the State of Bihar has no power to levy a tax by reason of such sales being 'outside " the State within Art. 286(1)(a) must be rejected.
We however consider that this submission is without force. Neither in the claim put forward in Exh. 'A' nor in para- graph 9 of the petition was any distinction drawn between sales under which deliveries were effected outside the State of Bihar for the purpose of consumption in the State of first destination and those in which the deliveries outside the State were effected for the purpose of consumption not in the State of first destination but in other States. In fact, this was made clear in the later paragraphs of the petition to the High Court from which it is apparent that the assessee-company made a claim for tax exemption in respect of sales in which the delivery took place outside the State of Bihar, whether the delivery was for the purpose of consumption in the State of first destination or otherwise. In paragraph 17(1) of the petition to the High Court the assessee stated: " (the petitioner was not liable to pay tax on goods delivered outside the State of Bihar which was also for consumption outside the State of Bihar ", and again in clause (iii) of the same paragraph this was repeated: " the goods being outside the State of Bihar, delivered outside the State of Bihar and consumed outside the State of Bihar were not liable to sales-tax by the State of Bihar " and similarly in cl. (v) of the same paragraph a reference was made to " goods delivered outside the State of Bihar for consumption outside the State of Bihar ". The same idea is emphasized in paragraph 19 also which contained the prayer of the petition. On these averments it is clear that the claim made by the assessee was that to invoke the exemption contained in Art. 286(1)(a) it was sufficient that the goods were delivered outside the State of Bihar and that it was immaterial whether the delivery was for the purpose of consumption in the State of first destination or otherwise. This involved the same argument which was raised by the learned Counsel that we have dealt with earlier. The learned Judges of the High Court were therefore right in drawing a distinction between the two types of sales which we have already indicated.
The last point that was urged by the learned Counsel was that the learned Judges of the High Court erred in requiring the assessee to prove that the goods delivered outside the State of Bihar were actually consumed in the State of first destination before the exemption from tax could be availed of In their judgment now under appeal the learned Judges have stated:
Under entry 42 of List II of the Government of India Act, 1935, the Provincial Legislatures could tax sales by selecting some fact or circumstance which provided a territorial nexus with the taxing power of the State even if the property in the goods sold passed outside the Province or the delivery under the contract of sale took place outside the Province. Legislation taxing sales depending solely upon the existence of a nexus, such as production or manufacture of the goods, or presence of the goods in the Province at the date of the contract of sale, between the sale and the Legislating Province could competently be enacted under the Government of India Act, 1935 see the Tata Iron and Steel Co., Ltd. v. The State of Bihar and Poppatlal Shah v. The State of Madras (2).
With a view to impose restrictions on the taxing power of the States under the pre-Constitution statutes, amendments were made in these statutes by the Adaptation of Laws Order. By the Adaptation of Laws Order, 1951, in the Bihar Sales Tax Act was incorporated with retrospective operation from January 26, 1950, s. 33, which provided:
This court has held in the Bengal Immunity Co., Ltd. v. The State of Bihar (1) that the operative provisions of the several parts of Art. 286 namely cl. (1) (a), (1)(b) and (2) and cl. (3) were intended to deal with different topics and one could not be projected or read into another. Therefore, by the incorporation of s. 33 in the Bihar Sales Tax Act read with Art. 286, notwithstanding the amplitude of the power otherwise granted by the charging section read with the definition of " sale ", a cumulative fetter of triple dimension was imposed upon the taxing power of the State. The Legislature of the Bihar State could not since January 26, 1950, levy a tax on sale of goods taking place outside the State or in the course of import of the goods into, or export of the goods out of the territory of India, or on sale of any goods where such sale took place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce. By the Explanation to Art. 286(1)(a) which is incorporated by sub-s. (2) s. 33 of the Bihar Sales Tax Act, a sale is deemed to take place in the State in which the goods are actually delivered as a direct result of such sale for the purpose of consumption in that State even though under the law relating to sale of goods the property in the goods has by reason of such sale passed in another State. In the State of Bombay v. The United Motors (India) Ltd. (2), it was held that (1) [1955] 2 S.C.R. 603.
since the enactment of Art. 286(1)(a), a sale described in the Explanation which may for convenience be called an "
The appellant company carries on the business of manufacturing copper and other mineral products in the State of Bihar. It has its registered office and its place of business in the District of Singhbhum in the State of Bihar and is registered as a " dealer " under the Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1947. The appellant company sent out its products to various places in India in the year of assessment ending on March 31, 1950 and has paid the tax assessed by the Sales Tax Officer. The appellant is now seeking to obtain a refund of the tax paid for the period between January 26 and March 31, 1950, on the plea that the tax was paid under a misapprehension of the law. The High Court in an application under Art. 226 of' the Constitution directed the Sales Tax authorities to refund so much of the tax as was not proved to have been paid in respect of sales of goods delivered and consumed in the State of first destination. On the goods delivered and consumed in the State of first destination outside Bihar, the appellant could not be called upon to pay sales tax. That is undisputed. The appellant also claimed that on the goods delivered for consumption in the State of first delivery outside Bihar, it was not liable to pay sales tax, even if there was no evidence to prove that the goods were in fact consumed in such State. In our judgment, the High Court was in error in directing that the exemption provided by Art. 286(1)(a) read with the Explanation which was at the material time incorporated by s. 33 in the Bihar Sales Tax Act by the Adaptation of Laws Order, 1951, only applied to all sales of goods delivered and consumed in the State of first destination. If the goods were delivered for consumption, it is immaterial whether they were in fact consumed in the State where they were delivered. The power of the State to levy sales tax relying upon the territorial nexus between the taxing power of the State and the sale, is impaired for reasons already set out to the extent to which it is restricted by the incorporation of Art. 286(1)(a)(i) and the Explanation thereto, in that Act. Therefore, sales effected on or after January 26, 1950, where goods are as a direct result of the sale delivered in another State for consumption in that other State, are not liable to be taxed. The directions issued by the High Court will therefore be modified as follows:	Precedent
outside the State " is capable of being understood in more senses than one. It could be understood as comprehending cases where no element or ingredient which constitutes a sale takes place within the State; in other words as applying solely to those cases where there exists no territorial nexus between the State imposing the tax and the sale. Obviously, this could not have been intended to be incorporated in Art. 286(1) because the tax in such cases would be beyond the legislative power of the State under Entry 54 of the State List read with Art. 246 of the Constitution. The expression " outside " has therefore to be understood not as a sale so " outside " as not to have any territorial connection between the State in question and the sale, but in a somewhat narrower sense. The real difficulty arises in ascertaining the precise content of the narrower sense in which the word is used as meaning a sale in substance " outside " the State, though there might be some elements of the sale which if the exemption under Art. 286(1)(a) were not enacted, would enable a State to levy a tax on the sale on the ground that it was within the legislative power of the State under Art. 246 read with Entry 54.
By Art. 286 of the Constitution, certain fetters were placed upon the legislative powers of the States as follows:
(2) Except in so far as Parliament may by law otherwise provide, no law of a State shall impose, or authorise the imposition of, a tax on the sale or purchase of any goods where such sale or purchase takes place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce :
By this amendment, on the taxing power of the Bihar State the same restrictions were engrafted on the pre-Constitution statute as were imposed by Art. 286 of the Constitution upon post-Constitution statutes.	Section

1960. November 7. The Judgment of Hidayatullah, Das Gupta and Ayyangar, JJ., was delivered by Ayyangar, J., and that of S. K. Das and Shah, JJ., was delivered by Shah, J. AYYANGAR. J.-The sole question which arises in this appeal, which comes by way of special leave is as to whether sales under which goods were delivered outside the State of Bihar for the purpose of consumption but not within the State of first delivery or first destination, are exempt from the levy of sales-tax by the Bihar State by virtue of Art. 286(1)(a) of the Constitution as it stood before the recent amendment.
The India Copper Corporation Ltd. (referred to hereafter as the assessee-company) carries on business in copper and various other materials and mineral pro. ducts and the office of its General Manager is in the district of Singhbhum in Bihar. The period covered by the assessment now in dispute is January 26, 1950 to March 31, 1950. The normal practice of the assessee-company was to deposit sums of money from time to time provisionally towards payment of sales-tax in advance and have the amount finally adjusted after the completion of the assessment of each year. The assessee-company followed this practice in respect of the amount of sales-tax due by it for the year 1949-50. For the financial year April 1, 1949 to March 31, 1950, the Superintendent of Sales-tax, Singhbhum, computed the tax liability of the company in the sum of Rs. 3,60,703-4-0 by an order of assessment dated November 13,1950, and the company made payment of the amount due by it beyond the sums already paid. It would be noticed that this financial year comprised two periods-(1) before the Constitution, viz., April 1, 1949 to January 25, 1950, and (2) the post-Constitution period from January 26, 1950 to March 31, 1950. There is now no controversy as regards the sales-tax payable in respect of sales effected during the pre-Constitution period. The assessee-company however raised a dispute that in respect of the post-Constitution period, it was not liable to pay any sales-tax in respect of sales to buyers, under which though the property in the goods passed within the State, delivery of the goods was effected outside the State of Bihar for consumption outside that State on the ground that such sales were exempted from tax by Art. 286(1)(a) of the Constitution as it originally stood. It addressed a formal letter to the Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, Bihar, on December 30, 1952, making this demand enclosing a statement showing full particulars of the goods sold, the bill numbers, the date and the amount etc., to enable the refund claimed to be calculated. The assessee-company followed it up by a formal petition for review of the assessment order by filing a revised return under s. 12(2) of the Bihar Sales-tax Act together with an application for refund. The departmental authorities rejected these applications by order dated July 20, 1953. Further proceedings before the department by way of revision etc. failed to secure to the assessee-company the relief which it claimed and thereafter it filed an application under Arts. 226 and 227 of the Constitution before the High Court of Patna praying for the issue of a writ to quash the order of assessment dated November 30, 1950, and the orders rejecting the prayers for review, reassessment and refund and for a direction to the departmental authorities to refund the sum realised by them in so far as the tax related to sales as a result of which goods were delivered outside the State of Bihar.
The learned Judges of the High Court held that the order of the Superintendent of Sales-tax, Singhbhum, dated November 13, 1950, should be set aside and that the matter should go back to the Superintendent to make a reassessment according to law for the post Constitution period. A further direction was added requiring the respondent to refund to the assessee so much of the tax as had been paid in excess of the amount of reassessment to be made by the Superinten- dent in accordance with the law as laid down by the Court. In formulating the law applicable, the learned Judges drew a distinction between sales as a direct result of which goods were delivered in a State outside the State of Bihar and consumed in that State and those cases in which the goods thus delivered, were not consumed in the State of first destination but were re-exported from the State of first destination to other States. They held that the first category of sales were covered by the Explanation to Art. 286 (1)(a) of the Constitution and were " inside " the State of first delivery and consequently " outside " the State of Bihar within the meaning of the Article and therefore exempt from tax by the Bihar State. In regard, however, to the second category of sales, it was held that they were not within the Explanation and were therefore outside the constitutional exemption under Art. 286(1)(a). The assessee-company not being satisfied, filed an application to the High Court for a Certificate of fitness under Arts. 132 and 133 of the Constitution, but this having been rejected, they applied to and obtained special leave from this Court under Art. 136 of the Constitution and that is how the appeal is now before us.
Three points were urged before us by Mr. B. C. Ghose, learned Counsel for the appellants: (1) that on a proper construction of Art. 286(1)(a) and the Explanation thereto (as it stood before the Article was amended by the Constitution Sixth Amendment Act, 1956) every sale as a direct result of which goods were delivered for consumption outside the State, was not within the taxing power of the State in which the goods were at the time of the sale, and ,in which property passed as a result thereof, and that it was immaterial whether the delivery was for the purpose of consumption in the State of first destination or whether the delivery in such State was not for the purpose of consumption therein but, for re-export to other States, (2) that even if Art. 286(1)(a) exempted only sales in which as a direct result of the sale the goods were delivered for the purpose of consumption in the State of first destination, on the pleadings and the evidence before the Court the assessee- company must be taken to have established that all the sales effected by it and in regard to which exemption from payment of tax was claimed, conformed to this requirement, (3) a narrower submission, that even it be that to fall within the Explanation the delivery has to be for the Purpose of consumption in the State of first destination, the learned Judges of the High Court erred in requiring the assessee- company to prove not merely that the goods were delivered for the purpose of consumption but further that the goods so delivered were actually consumed within that State. We shall now deal with these points in that order. Article 286(1)(a) together with the Explanation on whose construction the first point depends ran in these terms:
Explanation.-For the purposes of sub-clause (a) a sale or purchase shall be deemed to have taken place in the State in which the goods have actually been delivered as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of consumption in that State, notwithstanding the fact that under the general law relating to sale of goods the property in the goods has by reason of such sale or purchase passed in another State."
The scope and the purpose of this Explanation was discussed and explained by this Court in The State of Bombay v. Unitea Motors (India) Ltd. (1) and it is the passage in this judgment extracted below on which reliance was placed by the learned Counsel in support of his submission:
It might be mentioned that this portion of the judgment is unaffected by the dissent expressed in the later decision in The Bengal Immunity Company Ltd. v. The State of Bihar (1). The argument based upon this passage was broadly on these lines: Article 286 (1)(a) imposes a ban on the legislative power to levy a tax on sales which are outside " the taxing State. What sales are " outside is not easy to decide because that depends upon " the situs " of a sale, which cannot, in most cases, be located in any one place with certainty-being dependent on a variety of factors which might or might not converge. The Constitution makers did not directly define what was meant by a ,sale that was "
sale. It must however be pointed out that it was not disputed that the terms of the " Explanation " would not be satisfied unless the delivery was for the purpose of consumption therein, i.e. in the State of first destination, If the terms of the Explanation were satisfied, the State of " delivery. cum-consumption ", (to coin a convenient expression to designate the State in which goods are delivered as a direct result of the sale for the purpose of consumption therein), used in the Explanation, would have power to tax the sale as being one fictionally " inside "
in cases where goods were as a direct result of the sale delivered outside the State of Bihar for the purpose of consumption in the State of first destination, the conditions of the Explanation were satisfied and the sales being " outside " the State of Bihar could not be taxed by that State. So far there is no dispute and indeed the learned Judges of the High Court have, subject to a matter of detail to which reference will be made later, accepted the contention of the assessee. (2) a further consequence, that in cases where goods were delivered as a result of the sale outside the State of Bihar, but not for the purpose of consumption in such State of first destination, the terms of the Explanation were no doubt not satisfied and consequently the, sale was not inside such State of delivery and indeed not " inside " any State in India within the Explanation, but that such sales also must be held to be " outside "
outside the State " is capable of being understood in more senses than one. It could be understood as comprehending cases where no element or ingredient which constitutes a sale takes place within the State; in other words as applying solely to those cases where there exists no territorial nexus between the State imposing the tax and the sale. Obviously, this could not have been intended to be incorporated in Art. 286(1) because the tax in such cases would be beyond the legislative power of the State under Entry 54 of the State List read with Art. 246 of the Constitution. The expression " outside " has therefore to be understood not as a sale so " outside " as not to have any territorial connection between the State in question and the sale, but in a somewhat narrower sense. The real difficulty arises in ascertaining the precise content of the narrower sense in which the word is used as meaning a sale in substance " outside " the State, though there might be some elements of the sale which if the exemption under Art. 286(1)(a) were not enacted, would enable a State to levy a tax on the sale on the ground that it was within the legislative power of the State under Art. 246 read with Entry 54.
As already pointed out, the situs of a sale is not easy to determine and several factors which constitute a completed transaction of sale including the delivery of the goods, lay claim to be considered as in themselves constituting sufficient next to justify their being treated as determining the locus of a sale. Thus, merely by way of illustration, the place where the goods are at the time of the contract of sale, the place where the contract of sale is concluded, the place where the property in the goods passes and that in which the delivery takes place compete for recognition as constituting the locus of a sale. Before the Constitution, these and other similar factors were treated as affording sufficient territorial connection to endow the State in which any of the events occurred with legislative competence to tax the sale. This led to a multiplicity of the taxation of the same transaction of sale by a plurality of States, with the result that the consumer was hard hit and trade itself, and national economy suffered in the process. It has been pointed out that Art. 286(1)(a) was designed to counteract that state of affairs.
If a single State was designed to have the power to tax any particular transaction of sale, the question that next falls to be considered is the determination of that State in regard to which it could be predicated that the sale in question was not " outside " that State or in other words, the determination of the particular State in regard to which it could be said that the sale was " inside " that State. The key to the problem is afforded by two indications in the Article itself: (1) the opening words of Article 286(1) which speak of a sale or purchase taking place and (2) the non-obstante clause in the Explanation which refers to the general law relating to " sale of goods under which property in the goods has, by reason of such sale or purchase, passed in another State." These two together indicate that it is the passing of property within the State that is intended to be fastened on, for the purpose of determining, whether the sale in question is " inside " or " outside " the State, and therefore, subject to the operation of the " Explanation "
of sale is only executory, and the buyer has only a chose in action................. The Constitution thinks in terms of a completed sale by the passing of property and not in terms of an executory contract for the sale of goods." Notwithstanding that is not an " outside " sale, the power of the State to tax might be negatived by the operation of the Explanation which by its non-obstante clause-shifts the situs of the sale and renders the sale transaction one within the delivery-cum-consumption State, i.e. as the State in which the sale transaction must be deemed to take place. Where the terms of the Explanation are satisfied, the sale transaction will, by a legal fiction created by it, be deemed to take place "inside" the State of delivery and therefore " outside " the State in which the property passes. The conclusion reached therefore is that where the property in the goods passes within a State as a direct result of the sale, the sale transaction is not outside the State for the purpose of Art. 286(1)(a), unless the Explanation operates. We need also add that the power of the State to impose the tax might still not be available unless the transaction in question is unaffected by the other bans imposed under sub-cl. (1)(b), (2) and (3) of Art.
286. The submission therefore of learned Counsel for the appellants, that in respect of non-Explanation sales the State of Bihar has no power to levy a tax by reason of such sales being 'outside " the State within Art. 286(1)(a) must be rejected.
The second contention urged by the learned Counsel for the appellant was that even assuming he was wrong on the first point, all the sales by the assessee-company fell within the terms of the Explanation to Art. 286(1)(a) being sales as a direct result of which the goods were delivered for consumption in the State of first destination, and that the learned Judges of the High Court were in error in considering, that some of the sales did not conform to this requirement. In support of this submission learned counsel drew our attention to two matters. He first referred us to the application dated December 30, 1952 made on behalf of the assessee-company to the Commissioner of Commercial Taxes, Bihar, Patna in which the claim for refund of the tax paid was rested on the following ground :
We however consider that this submission is without force. Neither in the claim put forward in Exh. 'A' nor in para- graph 9 of the petition was any distinction drawn between sales under which deliveries were effected outside the State of Bihar for the purpose of consumption in the State of first destination and those in which the deliveries outside the State were effected for the purpose of consumption not in the State of first destination but in other States. In fact, this was made clear in the later paragraphs of the petition to the High Court from which it is apparent that the assessee-company made a claim for tax exemption in respect of sales in which the delivery took place outside the State of Bihar, whether the delivery was for the purpose of consumption in the State of first destination or otherwise. In paragraph 17(1) of the petition to the High Court the assessee stated: " (the petitioner was not liable to pay tax on goods delivered outside the State of Bihar which was also for consumption outside the State of Bihar ", and again in clause (iii) of the same paragraph this was repeated: " the goods being outside the State of Bihar, delivered outside the State of Bihar and consumed outside the State of Bihar were not liable to sales-tax by the State of Bihar " and similarly in cl. (v) of the same paragraph a reference was made to " goods delivered outside the State of Bihar for consumption outside the State of Bihar ". The same idea is emphasized in paragraph 19 also which contained the prayer of the petition. On these averments it is clear that the claim made by the assessee was that to invoke the exemption contained in Art. 286(1)(a) it was sufficient that the goods were delivered outside the State of Bihar and that it was immaterial whether the delivery was for the purpose of consumption in the State of first destination or otherwise. This involved the same argument which was raised by the learned Counsel that we have dealt with earlier. The learned Judges of the High Court were therefore right in drawing a distinction between the two types of sales which we have already indicated.
The last point that was urged by the learned Counsel was that the learned Judges of the High Court erred in requiring the assessee to prove that the goods delivered outside the State of Bihar were actually consumed in the State of first destination before the exemption from tax could be availed of In their judgment now under appeal the learned Judges have stated:
Under entry 42 of List II of the Government of India Act, 1935, the Provincial Legislatures could tax sales by selecting some fact or circumstance which provided a territorial nexus with the taxing power of the State even if the property in the goods sold passed outside the Province or the delivery under the contract of sale took place outside the Province. Legislation taxing sales depending solely upon the existence of a nexus, such as production or manufacture of the goods, or presence of the goods in the Province at the date of the contract of sale, between the sale and the Legislating Province could competently be enacted under the Government of India Act, 1935 see the Tata Iron and Steel Co., Ltd. v. The State of Bihar and Poppatlal Shah v. The State of Madras (2).
By Art. 286 of the Constitution, certain fetters were placed upon the legislative powers of the States as follows:
Explanation:For the purposes of sub-cl. (a) a sale or purchase shall be deemed to have taken place in the State in which the goods have actually been delivered as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of consumption in that State notwithstanding the fact that under the general law relating to sale of goods the property in the goods has by reason of such sale or purchase passed in another State.
(2) Except in so far as Parliament may by law otherwise provide, no law of a State shall impose, or authorise the imposition of, a tax on the sale or purchase of any goods where such sale or purchase takes place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce :
With a view to impose restrictions on the taxing power of the States under the pre-Constitution statutes, amendments were made in these statutes by the Adaptation of Laws Order. By the Adaptation of Laws Order, 1951, in the Bihar Sales Tax Act was incorporated with retrospective operation from January 26, 1950, s. 33, which provided:
By this amendment, on the taxing power of the Bihar State the same restrictions were engrafted on the pre-Constitution statute as were imposed by Art. 286 of the Constitution upon post-Constitution statutes.
This court has held in the Bengal Immunity Co., Ltd. v. The State of Bihar (1) that the operative provisions of the several parts of Art. 286 namely cl. (1) (a), (1)(b) and (2) and cl. (3) were intended to deal with different topics and one could not be projected or read into another. Therefore, by the incorporation of s. 33 in the Bihar Sales Tax Act read with Art. 286, notwithstanding the amplitude of the power otherwise granted by the charging section read with the definition of " sale ", a cumulative fetter of triple dimension was imposed upon the taxing power of the State. The Legislature of the Bihar State could not since January 26, 1950, levy a tax on sale of goods taking place outside the State or in the course of import of the goods into, or export of the goods out of the territory of India, or on sale of any goods where such sale took place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce. By the Explanation to Art. 286(1)(a) which is incorporated by sub-s. (2) s. 33 of the Bihar Sales Tax Act, a sale is deemed to take place in the State in which the goods are actually delivered as a direct result of such sale for the purpose of consumption in that State even though under the law relating to sale of goods the property in the goods has by reason of such sale passed in another State. In the State of Bombay v. The United Motors (India) Ltd. (2), it was held that (1) [1955] 2 S.C.R. 603.
(2) [1953] S.C.R. 1069.
since the enactment of Art. 286(1)(a), a sale described in the Explanation which may for convenience be called an "
Bihar, but not as a direct result of the sale or not for the purpose of consumption in the State of first delivery, the sale will not be covered by the Explanation, and the right to tax the sale, if arising-otherwise under the Act relying upon the territorial nexus, will not be impaired by the prohibition imposed by cl. (1)(a)(i) of s. 33. The right of the State of Bihar to tax a sale relying upon a real territorial nexus not being impaired by s. 33 of the Act, all sales as defined by s. 2(g) of the Bihar Sales Tax Act are liable to be taxed, except those falling within s. 33(1)(a)(ii), s. 33(2) and " Explanation sales " outside the State of Bihar.
The appellant company carries on the business of manufacturing copper and other mineral products in the State of Bihar. It has its registered office and its place of business in the District of Singhbhum in the State of Bihar and is registered as a " dealer " under the Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1947. The appellant company sent out its products to various places in India in the year of assessment ending on March 31, 1950 and has paid the tax assessed by the Sales Tax Officer. The appellant is now seeking to obtain a refund of the tax paid for the period between January 26 and March 31, 1950, on the plea that the tax was paid under a misapprehension of the law. The High Court in an application under Art. 226 of' the Constitution directed the Sales Tax authorities to refund so much of the tax as was not proved to have been paid in respect of sales of goods delivered and consumed in the State of first destination. On the goods delivered and consumed in the State of first destination outside Bihar, the appellant could not be called upon to pay sales tax. That is undisputed. The appellant also claimed that on the goods delivered for consumption in the State of first delivery outside Bihar, it was not liable to pay sales tax, even if there was no evidence to prove that the goods were in fact consumed in such State. In our judgment, the High Court was in error in directing that the exemption provided by Art. 286(1)(a) read with the Explanation which was at the material time incorporated by s. 33 in the Bihar Sales Tax Act by the Adaptation of Laws Order, 1951, only applied to all sales of goods delivered and consumed in the State of first destination. If the goods were delivered for consumption, it is immaterial whether they were in fact consumed in the State where they were delivered. The power of the State to levy sales tax relying upon the territorial nexus between the taxing power of the State and the sale, is impaired for reasons already set out to the extent to which it is restricted by the incorporation of Art. 286(1)(a)(i) and the Explanation thereto, in that Act. Therefore, sales effected on or after January 26, 1950, where goods are as a direct result of the sale delivered in another State for consumption in that other State, are not liable to be taxed. The directions issued by the High Court will therefore be modified as follows:	Total Judgement
