1961. March 22. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SUBBA RAO, This is an appeal by special leave against the judgment and decree of the Judicial Commissioner at Ajmer dated October 27, 1953, confirming the judgment of the District Judge, Ajmer, and setting aside that of the Subordinate Judge, First Class, Ajmer, in Civil Suit No. 48 of 1944.	Issue
Assuming that the plaintiff remembered exactly what all happened when he was only 9 years old, the version given by him does not prove that Hira Lal as a representative of his father gave him and Moti Singh received him as a part of the ceremony of adoption. The events narrated by him only show that Hira Lal brought him to Ajmer so that he might be taken to Gurukul. Hira Lal, as D.W. 4, described the incident thus:	PetArg

Much to the same effect it is stated in Mayne's Hindu Law, llth edn., at p. 237:
The leading decision on this subject is that of the Judicial Committee is Shoshinath Ghose v. Krishnasundari Dasi (1). That was, like the present, a case of adoption among Sudras. There, it was contended, inter alia, that there was a formal adoption by giving and taking, and in the alternative it was contended that even if there had been no formal adoption as alleged, the deeds of giving and taking, executed in 1864, were sufficient to bring about the adoption and that was all that was essential in the case of Sudras. Sir J. W. Colvile, speaking for the Board, rejected both the contentions. He accepted-the finding of the lower courts that there was no formal giving and taking, and rejected the argument that the documents themselves operated as a complete giving and taking of the adoptive boy. The learned Judge observed at p. 388 thus:
That a formal ceremony of giving and taking is essential to validate the adoption has been emphasized by the Judicial Committee again in Krishna Rao v. Sundara Siva Rao (1). But in practice many situations had arisen when it became impossible for a natural father to hand over the adoptive boy physically, or to an adoptive father or mother to receive the adoptive boy physically due to physical infirmity or other causes. In such cases Courts have stepped in and recognized the delegation of the physical act of giving and taking provided there was an agreement between the natural and adoptive parents to give and receive the boy in adoption. The scope of the power of delegation has been clearly stated by West, J., in Vijiarangam v. Lakshuman (2) thus:
This view was approved by the Bombay High Court (1) (1931) L.R. 58 I.A. 148.
in Shamsing v. Santabai (1). A division bench of the Madras High Court in Viyyamma v. Suryaprakasa Rao (2) applied the principle to a converse case of an adoptive father delegating his power to accept the adoptive boy to another. Sir Lionel Leach, C.J., in extending the rule of delegation to a case of receiving says at p. 613 thus:
Strong reliance is placed by learned counsel for the appellant on the decision of the Judicial Committee in Biradhmal v. Prabhabhati (3). There a widow executed a deed of adoption whereby she purported to have adopted as son to her deceased husband a boy. The Sub-Registrar before whom the document was registered put to the boy's natural father and to the widow questions whether they had executed the deed. The boy was also present at that time. The Judicial Committee held that, under the said circumstances, there was proof of giving and taking. The question posed by the Privy Council was stated thus: "The sole issue discussed before their Lordships was the question of fact whether on 30th June, 1924, at about 6 p.m. when the adoption deed wag being registered the boy was present and was given by Bhanwarmal and taken by the widow". The question so posed was answered thus at p. 155:
This sentence is rather laconic and may lend support to the argument that mere putting questions by the Sub-Registrar would amount to giving and taking of the adoptive boy; but the subsequent discussion makes it clear that the Privy Council had not laid down any such wide proposition. Their Lordships proceeded to observe:	Precedent
The following genealogy will be useful to appreciate the contentions, of the parties:
Further citation would be redundant. It is, therefore, settled law that, after the natural and adoptive parents exercised their volition to give and take the boy in adoption, either of them could, under certain unavoidable compelling circumstances, delegate his right to give 'or the right to receive the adoptive son, as the case may be, to a third party.	Section
Sudras, no ceremonies are necessary in addition to the giving and taking of the child in adoption.................. it would seem, therefore, that, according to Hindu usage, which the Courts should accept as governing the law, the giving and taking in adoption ought to take place by the father banding ove r the child to the adoptive mother, and the adoptive mother declaring that she accepts the child in adoption."

questions whether they had executed the deed is sufficient to prove a giving and taking."
The law may be briefly stated thus: Under the Hindu Law, whether among the regenerate caste or among Sudras, there cannot be a valid adoption unless the adoptive boy is transferred from one family to another and that can be done only by the ceremony of giving and taking. The object of the corporeal giving and receiving in adoption is obviously to secure due publicity. To achieve this object it is essential to have a formal ceremony. No particular form is prescribed for the ceremony, but the law requires that the natural parent shall band over the adoptive boy and the adoptive parent shall receive him. The nature of the ceremony may vary depending upon the circumstances of each case. But a ceremony there shall be, and giving and taking shall be part of it. The exigencies of the situation arising out of diverse cir- cumstances necessitated the introduction of the doctrine of delegation; and, therefore, the parents, after exercising their volition to give and take the boy in adoption, may both or either of them delegate the physical act of handing over the boy or receiving him,. as the case may be, to a third party.
In the present case, none of the aforesaid conditions has been satisfied. The High Court found that Zalim Singh and Moti Singh did not decide to take the boy in adoption on February 14, 1923. The High Court further found that their common intention was to take. the boy in adoption only after he was admitted in Gurukul or thereafter. The documents filed and the oral evidence adduced in the case establish that the adoptive father did not delegate his power to give the boy in adoption to Moti Singh to Hira Lal and that Moti Singh did not receive the boy as a part of the ceremony of adoption, but only received him with a. view to send him to Gurukul. We. therefore, hold that the ceremony of giving and taking, which is very essential for the validity of an adoption, had not taken place in this case. In the result, we hold, agreeing with the Judicial' Commissioner, that the appellant was not adopted by Moti Singh. The appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.
Appeal dismissed.	Conclusion
CIVIL APPELLATE, JURiSDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 430 of 1957. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and decree dated 27th October, 1953, of the former Judicial Commissioner, Ajmer, in Civil Second Appeal No. 25 of 1951. C. B. Agarwala, S. S. Deedwani and K. P. Gupta, for appellant.

1961. March 22. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SUBBA RAO, This is an appeal by special leave against the judgment and decree of the Judicial Commissioner at Ajmer dated October 27, 1953, confirming the judgment of the District Judge, Ajmer, and setting aside that of the Subordinate Judge, First Class, Ajmer, in Civil Suit No. 48 of 1944.
The following genealogy will be useful to appreciate the contentions, of the parties:
It is said that the phrase "with a view to adopt" is not a correct translation and the correct translation is "on account of adoption". But the context in which the said words appear leaves no room for doubt that Moti Singh was informing Zalim Singh that no ceremony would be performed as the boy might or might not be admitted into Gurukul. But he assured him that he was being admitted in Gurukul only with a view to adopt him. This letter also proves that Moti Singh did not contemplate any adoption, at any rate till the boy was admitted in Gurukul. Ex. P/3 dated February 9, 1923, is another letter written by Moti Singh to Zalim Singh wherein Moti Singh informed Zalim Singh that the election- meaning selection-of students for Gurukul would take place on February 28 and, therefore, he asked him to send Lakshman Singh at once. Ex. P/4 is an agreement entered into between the authorities of Gurukul Kaiigri and the parents of Lakshman Singh. In the preamble to that agreement Lakshman Singh is described as the grandson of Sujan Singh. It does not carry the matter further, as Lakshman Singh being Sujan Singh's brothers grandson, the description would be consistent even if there was no adoption. Ex. P/5 is the application for admission of Lakshman Singh in Gurukul. It is not dated, but it appears to have been put in between January 3, 1923, and February 14, 1923. It was sent by the natural father of Lakshman Singh. This may be explained by the plaintiff that, as on the date of the application the adoption had not taken place, the natural father signed it. Ex. P/26 is a will executed by Sujan Singh wherein he bequeathed his properties to Moti Singh and gave a vested remainder to Lakshman Singh. In the document Lakshman Singh was described as follows:
The oral evidence in the case is also consistent with the documentary evidence. P. Ws. 1, 2, 4, 5 and 7 speak if a custom in the community to which the parties belong to the effect that in that community the consent of the person giving in adoption and the person taking in adoption and the going of the adopted son from his original family to live in the adoptive family wore the preliminary steps to a valid adoption. But no attempt has been made in any of the courts below to sustain the adoption on the alleged custom and, therefore, we do not propose to consider the evidence relating to the alleged custom. P.W. 2, who is a maternal uncle of the plaintiff, further says that the plaintiff was sent to Ajmer with Hira Lal and that Hira Lal was given instructions by Zalim Singh and the father of P.W. 2 to go via Bhilwara and Masooda and on reaching Ajmer to hand over the boy to Moti Singh. But in the cross-examination, he said that he did not know "if the cocoanuts about the plaintiff's adoption have been distributed or not till now"
Assuming that the plaintiff remembered exactly what all happened when he was only 9 years old, the version given by him does not prove that Hira Lal as a representative of his father gave him and Moti Singh received him as a part of the ceremony of adoption. The events narrated by him only show that Hira Lal brought him to Ajmer so that he might be taken to Gurukul. Hira Lal, as D.W. 4, described the incident thus:
In the cross-examination he further elaborated thus:
The version given by this witness is natural and the last answer given by him stamps the evidence with a seal of impartiality. His evidence is consistent with the entire documentary evidence-adduced in the case. He was head-clerk of Raj Sri Medraj Sabha, Udaipur, and he appears to be a disinterested witness. Without any hesitation we accept his evidence. His evidence clearly shows that he brought the plaintiff and left him with Moti Singh in Ajmer as he had to be sent to Gurukul. Ex. D/4 is a copy of a pamphlet circulated by Zalim Singh to Juwan Singh Mehta. It is dated September. 6, 1938, i.e., after disputes arose between the parties. Therein he stated what took place on the date when the plaintiff was sent to Ajmer thus:
It is for the first time the idea of delegation has been introduced and, in our opinion, it was done presumably on some legal advice. This is an attempt to give a legal flavour to an ordinary act of sending a boy with an elderly gentleman to another place. We cannot act upon the self-serving statement made by this person in 1938. It is impossible to conceive that the necessary ceremony of adoption, that is, "giving and taking" would be done in such a casual manner and that the natural father or the natural mother or the near relations would not have gone to the place of the adoptive father if a ceremony was scheduled to take place on a particular date. We, therefore, hold, on the evidence, oral and documentary, that Sujan Singh and Moti Singh wanted to take the plaintiff in adoption either after the boy was admitted in Gurukul or after he finished his education therein, that Hira Lal, on the request of the plaintiff's father, accompanied the boy to Sujait Singh's house at Ajmer and left him there, that Moti Singh welcomed the boy as was expected of him and thereafter sent hint to Gurukul and that no formal ceremony of "giving and taking"

This sentence is rather laconic and may lend support to the argument that mere putting questions by the Sub-Registrar would amount to giving and taking of the adoptive boy; but the subsequent discussion makes it clear that the Privy Council had not laid down any such wide proposition. Their Lordships proceeded to observe:
These observations indicate that on the material placed before the Privy Council-it is not necessary to say that we would come to the same conclusion on the same material-it hold that there was giving and taking of the boy at about 6 p.m. when the document was given for registration. The Judicial Committee, in our view, did not intend to depart- from the well recognized doctrine of Hindu Law that there should be a ceremony of giving and taking to validate an adoption.
The law may be briefly stated thus: Under the Hindu Law, whether among the regenerate caste or among Sudras, there cannot be a valid adoption unless the adoptive boy is transferred from one family to another and that can be done only by the ceremony of giving and taking.
