Sewa Singh & Ors vs Jangir Singh & Ors on 15 December, 1954	Case Title
JUDGMENT AIR 1956 SC 1 The Judgment was delivered by :
2. On the pleadings of the parties the trial Judge framed four material issues :
The plaintiff having been unsuccessful in the first two courts preferred a second appeal to the High Court of PEPSU. This appeal was in the first instance heard by a single Judge who expressed of doubt as to the correctness of the opinion of the two courts below regarding their decisions on the ancestral character of the land.	Issue
Issue No. 1 was decided in favour of the plaintiff but all the other issues were decided against him. In the result the plaintiff's suit was dismissed, the parties being left to bear their own costs. On issue No. 4 the learned Judge held that from the extract of the record of rights placed by the defendants on the record and the copy of the pedigree table it was clear that the land in dispute was ancestral qua the descendants of Gainda, the common ancestor of this family.	Facts
A new point was urged before him that even if the adoption was invalid, the property being self-acquired Bishan Singh could make a gift in favour of Jangir Singh and Bishan Singh having declared in the deed of adoption that Jangir Singh would inherit to his movable and immovable properties after his death, Jangir Singh was entitled to them.
(2) If a person governed by Customary Law adopts another person as his son and the adoption is later on set aside as invalid according to custom, can the adopted son succeed to the non-ancestral property of the adoptive father on the ground that his adoption was tantamount to a gift or bequest"	PetArg
The adoption of the plaintiff was held invalid on the ground that according to custom Bishan Singh could not adopt a descendant of his maternal grandfather and it was only a collateral or an agnatic relation who could be adopted amongst the Jats of these parts.
3. The decision of the trial Judge was affirmed in appeal by the District Judge who also took the view that a stranger to the family of the adopter could not be adopted under custom by which the parties were governed. On the ancestral nature of the property the learned District Judge observed as follows :
The learned Judge thinking that this question was of sufficient importance to be decided by a larger bench directed the case to be laid before the Chief Justice for constituting a bench. The appeal was then heard by a Division Bench of the court. The bench reversed the concurrent finding of the first two courts on the question of the nature of the property and held that it had not been proved to be ancestral. The decision on this point was stated in these terms :
The Division Bench having decided that the land was not proved to be ancestral proceeded to refer the following questions to a Full Bench :
Bishan Singh at the time of the regular settlement held 122 bighas 16 biswas of land which was described as being 1/7the share of the total family holding. The shares of the descendants of the other sons of Gainda Singh were also described in similar terms. Some of them held one-half of 1/7th, others held one third of 1/7th and so on. This subdivison was in accordance with the number of the descendants of each one of the seven sons. An explanatory note is appended to this pedigree and it is in these terms :
It has not been suggested that any to the descendants of Gainda Singh acquired any land in this Patti by purchase of introduced strangers in it by selling any portion of their ancestral holding. That being so, the learned District Judge was justified in drawing the inference from the circumstance of equality of holdings and the reference to these in terms of ancestral shares, that the land in suit had develved on Bishan Singh by descent from Gainda, and there were no valid grounds for referring that decision.
There is nothing in this document from which an inference could be drawn that there was any disturbance in the scale of holding in Patti Gainda. On the other hand the "Paimana Haqiyat"(measure of right) as given in the records clearly indicates that the Patti is being held by the descendants of Gainda according to ancestral shares. In these circumstances there was no reason for doubting the ancestral character of the land in dispute in this case.	Precedent
4. In our judgment the appeal can be disposed of on the short ground that there was no justification whatsoever for setting aside the concurrent finding of the first two courts on the question of the character of the land in dispute, and there is thus no necessity to resolve the legal question raised, as in that view of the case the plaintiff's suit is admittedly bound to fail. It appears from the entries in the pedigree table prepared at the settlement of 1907-09 that Gainda, the common ancestor of Bishan Singh and of the defendants, had seven sons and Bishan Singh and the defendants represent the line of these sons, Bishan Singh having descended from Samonda, while the defendants being the descendants of the other brothers of Samonda.
5. The High Court for its conclusion placed reliance on the "Kafiat Dehi"(village history) as given in the settlement record, this is what is stated therein :
We are further of the opinion that this was not a fit case in which a concurrent finding of the first two courts should have been set aside on further appeal even if the finding was not binding under the law then prevailing in PEPSU and the High Court could re-examine the finding in second appeal.
6. The result is that this appeal is allowed, the judgment of the High Court is set aside, and that of the trial judge dismissing the plaintiff's suit is restored. In the circumstances of this case, we make no order as to costs.	Conclusion

4. In our judgment the appeal can be disposed of on the short ground that there was no justification whatsoever for setting aside the concurrent finding of the first two courts on the question of the character of the land in dispute, and there is thus no necessity to resolve the legal question raised, as in that view of the case the plaintiff's suit is admittedly bound to fail.

This subdivison was in accordance with the number of the descendants of each one of the seven sons. An explanatory note is appended to this pedigree and it is in these terms :
From these entries which carry a presumption of truth it is clear that the whole of the land which was once owned by the common ancestor was at the time of the regular settlement in possession of his descendants according to ancestral share and the shamlat deh which is also in suit was also divisible according to ancestral shares.
It has not been suggested that any to the descendants of Gainda Singh acquired any land in this Patti by purchase of introduced strangers in it by selling any portion of their ancestral holding. That being so, the learned District Judge was justified in drawing the inference from the circumstance of equality of holdings and the reference to these in terms of ancestral shares, that the land in suit had develved on Bishan Singh by descent from Gainda, and there were no valid grounds for referring that decision.
The circumstances established in the case are compatible only with the theory that this land came to his sons from Gainda and these circumstances cannot be explained on any other reasonable hypothesis.
5. The High Court for its conclusion placed reliance on the "Kafiat Dehi"(village history) as given in the settlement record, this is what is stated therein :
There is nothing in this document from which an inference could be drawn that there was any disturbance in the scale of holding in Patti Gainda.

In these circumstances there was no reason for doubting the ancestral character of the land in dispute in this case.
