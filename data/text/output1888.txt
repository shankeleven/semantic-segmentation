1961. March 14. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SHAH, J.-These five appeals raise a common question about the validity of Rule 2C framed by the respondent--the Municipality of Barsi under s. 58(j) of the Bombay Municipal Boroughs Act, 1925-hereinafter called the Act. The Lokmanya Mills-hereinafter called the appellants-are a company registered under the Indian Companies Act holding an expensive area of land City Survey No. 2554 within the Municipal Borough on which are constructed buildings of the factory, ware-houses, bungalows and other structures appurtenant to the factory. The respondent, a Borough Municipality constituted under the Act is by s. 73, entitled to levy a rate on lands and buildings and also a water-rate. Under the rules framed by the Municipality house-tax and water-tax were levied on buildings and non- agricultural lands on their annual letting value at uniform rates whether the purpose was residential, business or manufacturing.	Issue
In 1944, the Municipality resolved to enhance the assessment of lands and buildings within its area.. After some correspondence with the Commissioner, Central Division, the General Body of the Municipality resolved that the rental value for leaving rates on mills and factories within its limits be fixed at Rs. 40 for every 100 square feet. Notices of this resolution under s. 75(b) of the Act were issued and objections to the proposed enhancement were invited from the taxpayers and after obtaining the approval of the Government of Bombay, the new rules were made operative from April 1, 1947. The rules relevant for the purposes of these appeals are:	Facts

building subject to certain deductions. The Municipality of Bezwada levied property tax on a piece of vacant land belonging to the Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway Company on the annual value computed at 6% of its capital value. This method of taxation was challenged by the Railway Company on the contention that all methods of valuation other than the method prescribed by the proviso to s. 82(2) were by necessary implication prohibited. This contention was rejected because the generality of the sub. stantive enactment was left unqualified except in so far as it concerned the particular subjects to which the proviso related. Open lands were not covered by the proviso and it was competent to the municipality to levy the tax under s. 82(2) on the annual value and that value would be determined by any of the recognised methods of arriving at the rent which a hypothetical tenant 'may reasonably be expected to pay for the lands in question. This case has in our judge- ment no relevance to the present case.
If the Municipality of Barsi had adopted any of the recognised methods of valuation for assessing the annual letting value, the tax would not, be open to challenge, but the method adopted was not a recognised method of levying the rate.' The High Court relied upon its earlier judgment in The Borough Municipality of Amalner v. The Pratap Spinning Weaving and Manufacturing Co.p Ltd., Amalner (1). In that case, the court negatived the challenge to the validity of the rules similar to those impugned in these appeals. The Amalner Municipality had by rules framed under the Bombay Municipal Boroughs Act sought to levy a rate equal to a per- centage of the annual letting value which was computed on the floor area of "mills and factories". The court held that the method of taxation adopted by the Municipality had remained unchallenged for a long time,, that the rules had been sanctioned by the Government and they were not shown to be "capricious, arbitrary and unreasonable and that the valuation of the property by reference to the floor area was (1) I.L.R. (1952) Bom. 918.
not altogether unknown to the law of rating. The High Court also observed that in assessing the rent 2 which a hypothetical tenant may pay several methods are open to the Municipality and if on examining the cases of all the factory buildings within their jurisdiction, the Municipality concluded that the rent which the hypothetical tenant may reasonably be expected to pay for those buildings fits in with the rent which they had fixed by adopting the flat and uniform rate the principle of fixing the annual letting value on the basis of the floor area would not be open to challenge. It was assumed in that case that all factory buildings within the area of the Amalner Municipality were. alike in essential features and were intended to be used for purposes which were alike, and that probably the Municipality may have been satisfied that the principle enunciated in the rule impugned worked out on the whole as a fair basis for determining the valuation of the building in question. In our view, this approach to a rating problem arising under the Act is not permissible. In any event, there is no evidence on the record of this case that the factories and "buildings relating thereto" such as ware-houses, godowns and shops of the Mills situate in the compound of the mills, may be separately let at the uniform rate prescribed' by the Municipality. The vice of the rule lies in an assumed uniformity of return per square foot which structures of different classes which are in their nature not similar, way reasonably fetch if let out to tenants and in the virtual deprivation to the rate-payer of his statutory right to object to the valuation. Another judgment of the Bombay High Court in Motiram Keshavdas v. Ahmedabad Muncipal Borough (1) calls for reference. It was held in Motiram's case that a water-tax imposed by the Ahmedabad Municipality as a rate not depending upon the value of the property assessed but in lump sum was not a rate for the purpose of s. 73(x) of the Bombay Municipal Boroughs Act, 1925 and the rule which authorised the levy of such a lump sum was ultra vires (2) (1942) Bom.
