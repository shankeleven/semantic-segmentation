Hardyal Hardy and D. Gupta, for the appellant. N. C. Chatterjee, Dipak Choudhri and B. N. Ghosh, for the respondent.
1960. November 28. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR, J. - This is an appeal by special leave against the judgment and order of the High Court of Judicature at Calcutta in a reference made by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal under s. 66(1) of the Income-tax Act. The following question was referred:
and it was in the interest of the respondent to see that the races are not abandoned on account of the scarcity of jockeys. In the order of the Tribunal it is stated that this was not the case of the respondent, and therefore when the respondent wanted paragraph 5 of the statement to be substituted by the following:
But those observations must be read in the context. In that case the assessee firm was the Managing Agent of a Company and at the request of the Directors of (1) [1951] S.C.R. 594, 598. (2) [1960] 38 I.T.R. 601, 610.
the latter agreed to accept a lesser commission for the year of account than it was entitled to. It was found, by the Appellate Tribunal there that the amount was expended for reasons of commercial expediency and was not given as a bounty but to strengthen the managed company so that if its financial position became strong the assessee would benefit thereby, and an the evidence the Tribunal came to the conclusion that the amount was wholly and exclusively for the purpose of such business. It was on this evidence that the expense was held to be wholly and exclusively laid out for the purpose of the assessee's business and this was the finding referred to. In that case the Tribunal had not misdirected itself as to the true scope and meaning of the words "wholly and exclusively laid out for the purpose of the assessee's business". In the present case the Income- tax Appellate Tribunal had misdirected itself as to the true scope and meaning of these words. In our opinion, in the circumstances of this case, it cannot be said that the finding of the Tribunal was one of fact.
The question as to whether the expenses of running the school for jockeys is deductible has to be decided taking into consideration the circumstances of this case. The business of -the respondent was to run race meetings on a commercial scale for which it is necessary to have races of as high an order as possible. For the popularity of the races run by the respondent and to make its business profitable it was necessary that there were jockeys of requisite skill and experience in sufficient numbers who would be available to the owners and trainers because without such efficient jockeys the running of race meetings would not be commercially profitable. It was for this purpose that the respondent started the school for training Indian jockeys., If there were not sufficient number of efficient Indian jockeys to ride horses its interest would have suffered, and it might have had to abandon its business if it did not take steps to make jockeys of the necessary calibre available. Therefore any expenditure which was incurred for preventing the extinction of the respondent's business would, in our opinion, be expenditure wholly and exclusively laid out for the purpose of the business of the assessee and would be an allowable deduction. This finds support from decided cases. In Commissioner of Income-tax v. Chandulal Keshavlal & Co. (1), this Court held that in order to justify a deduction the disbursement must be for reasons of commercial expediency; it may be voluntary but incurred for the assessee's business; and if the expense is incurred for the purpose of the business of the assessee it does not matter that the payment also enures to the benefit of a third party. Another test laid down was that if the transaction is properly entered into as a part of the assessee's legitimate commercial undertaking in order to facilitate the carrying on of its business it is immaterial that a third party also benefits thereby. In British Insulated and Helsby Cables v. Atherton (2), Viscount Cave L. C. held that a Bum of money expended, not of necessity and with a view to a direct and immediate benefit to the trade, but voluntarily and on the ground of commercial expediency and in order indirectly to facilitate the carrving on of the business may yet be expended wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the trade. In a case more recently decided Morgan v. Tate & Lyle Ltd. (3) the assessee company was engaged in sugar refining business and it incurred expenses in a propaganda campaign to oppose the threatened nationalisation of the industry. It was held by the House of Lords by a majority that the object of the expenditure being to preserve the assets of the company from seizure and so to enable it to carry on its business and earning profits, the expense was an admissible deduction being wholly and exclusively laid out for the purpose of the company's trade. Lord Morton of Henryton said:
If the assets are seized, the company can no longer (1) (1960) 38 I.T.R. 601, 610. (2) [1926] A.C. 205. (3) [1955] A.C. 21.
carry on the trade which has been carried on by the use of these assets. Thus the money is spent to preserve the very existence of the company's trade".
See also Strong & Co. v. Woodifield(1), the observations of Lord Davey; and Smith v. Incorporated Council of Law Reporting (2).
Counsel for the appellant relied upon the judgment of the Privy Council in Ward & Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Taxes (3 ), but that decision proceeds on a different statute where the words were of a very restrictive character, the words being:
supply of jockeys of efficiency and skill failed the business of the respondent would no longer be possible. Thus the money was spent for the preservation of the respondent's business.
As to the third point there is no substance in the submission that the expenditure was in the nature of a capital expense because no asset of enduring nature was being created by this expense.
In our opinion the High Court has rightly held that the expenditure claimed was one which was wholly and exclusively laid out for the purpose of the respondent's business. It was to prevent the threatened extinction of the business of the respondent. In the result this appeal is dismissed with costs.
Appeal dismissed.	Total Judgement
