Pradyat Kumar Bose vs The Honble The Chief Justice Of Calcutta ... on 23 December, 1955	Case Title
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeals Nos. 245 and 202 of 1953.
Appeal under Article 132(1) of the Constitution of India from the judgment and order dated the 27th January 1953 of the Calcutta High Court in Matter No. 139 of 1952. Ranadeb Chaudhry, Anil Kumar Das Gupta and Sukumar Ghose, for the appellant.	Issue
S.M. Bose, Advocate-General,' for West Bengal (B. Sen and P. K. Bose, with him) for the respondent. 1955. December 23. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by JAGANNADHADAS J.-This is an appeal by leave of the High Court of Calcutta under article 132(1) of the Constitution. The appellant before us was the Registrar and Accountant-General of the High Court at Calcutta on its Original Side. He was appointed to the post by the Chief Justice of the High Court on the 4th March, 1948 and confirmed therein on the 15th of November, 1948. He was dismissed therefrom with effect from the 1st September, 1951, by an order of the Chief Justice dated the 3rd September, 1951. There were various charges against him and Mr. Justice Das Gupta was deputed by order of the Chief Justice dated the 28th May, 1651, to make an' enquiry and submit a report. Mr. Justice Das Gupta made a full enquiry and submitted his report on the 11th August, 1951, in which he exonerated the appellant in respect of some of the charges but found him guilty in respect of the other charges. The learned Judge expressed his conclusion as follows:
The Chief Justice issued to the appellant a notice on the 16th August, 1951, intimating that be agreed with the report after careful consideration thereof and asking him to show cause why he should Dot be dismissed from his post. The appellant was given a hearing by the Chief Justice on the 31st August, 1951. The order dated the 3rd September, 1951, of the Chief Justice dismissing the appellant from his office, a copy of which was served on him, runs as follows:
On the 25th January, 1952, the appellant submitted a petition to the Governor of West Bengal for cancellation of the above order. He received intimation dated the 9th July, 1952, that the "Governor declines to interfere on his behalf". Thereupon he filed an application to the Chief Justice for review of the prior order of dismissal. It may be mentioned that it was Chief Justice, Sir Arthur Trevor Harries, who had initiated the proceedings against the appellant and passed the order of dismissal. He retired in June, 1952. The application for review was made to the successor Chief Justice, Shri P. B. Chakravarti, on the 11th September, 1952. This application was rejected on the 16th September, 1952. Thereafter on the 24th November, 1952, i.e., more than an year after the order of dismissal, a writ application was filed on the Original Side of the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution against the Hon'ble the Chief Justice of the High Court "for calling upon him to bring up the records of the proceedings relating to his dismissal in order that justice may be done by quashing or otherwise dealing with the said proceedings and the said order dated the 3rd September, 1951, purporting to terminate his services and for directions being given to the Chief Justice to desist from giving effect to or acting in any manner under the said order". On the presentation of the application the learned Judge on the Original Side, Mr. Justice Bose, issued a rule nisi calling upon the Hon'ble the Chief Justice to show cause why an order in the nature of a writ as asked for should not be made. This order was duly served and on its return the learned Judge made an order referring the hearing of the application to a Special Bench of three Judges as per the rules of the Court. Accordingly the petition was, under the directions of the Chief Justice, heard by three learned Judges of the High Court, who after elaborate hearing and consideration of the points urged on behalf of the appellant dismissed the application. Leave to appeal to this Court was, however, granted by them under article 132(1) on the ground that the case involves substantial questions of law relating to interpretation of the Constitution.	Facts
The main points that have been urged by the appellant before us, as before the High Court, are that-
The points urged on behalf of the appellant may first be taken up. The most important out of them is the one relating to the authority of the Chief Justice to pass the order of dismissal as against the appellant. It is beyond dispute that the Chief Justice is the authority for appointing the appellant. It was in fact the Chief Justice who appointed the appellant and confirmed him. But it is strongly urged that he had not the power to dismiss. This argument is based on the assumption that the appellant falls within the category of public servants who are governed by the Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, (hereinafter referred to as the Civil Services Rules) of the year 1930 as amended from time to time and that the said rules continue to apply, to an officer holding the post which he did, even after the Government of India Act, 1935, and later the Constitution of India of 1950 successively came into force. I the argument recognises the fact that dismissal is a matter which falls within conditions of service of a public servant as held by the Privy Council in North-West Frontier Province v. Suraj Narain Anand(1) and that the power of making rules relating to conditions of service of the staff of the High Courts is vested in the Chief Justice of the Court under section 242(4) taken with section 241 of the Government of India Act, 1935, as also under article 229(2) of the Constitution of India, 1950. But (1) [1948] L.R. 75 I.A. 843.	PetArg
The second objection that has been taken is that even if the power of dismissal is vested in the Chief Justice, the appellant was entitled to the protection (1) [1911] A.C. 179, 182.	RespArg
It may be mentioned that under clause 10 of the Charter of the Supreme Court of Calcutta issued in 1774, the said Court also was in specific terms "authorized and empowered from time to time, as occasion may require, to appoint so many and such clerks and other ministerial officers as shall be found necessary for the administration of justice". The power of removal or of taking other disciplinary action as regards such appointees was not in terms granted. But there is historical evidence to show that the power of appointment conferred under the Charter was always understood as comprising the above powers. Sir Charles Wood, the then Secretary of State for India in paragraph 10 of his dispatch to the Governor-General dated the 17th May, 1862, (on the formation of the new High Courts) stated as follows:
It is this power and authority along with other judicial power and authority that was succeeded to by the High Courts (on their formation in supersession of the Supreme and Sadar Courts) by virtue of section 9 of the Indian High Courts Act, in the following terms.
Thus it is clear that both under the Charter of the Supreme Court as well as under the Letters Patent of the High Court, the power of appointment was throughout understood as vesting in the High Court or the Chief Justice, the complete administrative and disciplinary control over its staff, including the power of dismissal.
These sections, while keeping intact the power of ap- pointment of the members of the staff of the High Court with the Chief Justice as contained in the Letters Patent, provide, statutorily for the first time and in express terms what was implicit in clause 8 of the Letters Patent, viz., that the power to regulate and frame rules relating to conditions of service governing such staff is also vested in the Chief Justice subject however to two limitations indicated by the provisos mentioned above. The corresponding provisions in the present Constitution relating to the powers of the Chief Justice in relation to the recruitment and service conditions of the staff of the High Court are almost identical and are contained in article
229. They are as follows:
of such power. As pointed out by the House of Lords in Board of Education v. Rice(1), a functionary who has to decide an administrative matter, of the nature involved in this case, can obtain the material on which he is to act in such manner as may be feasible and convenient, provided only the affected party "has a fair opportunity to correct or contradict any relevant and prejudicial material". The following passage from the speech of Lord Chancellor in Local Government Board V. Arlidge (2) is apposite and in- structive.
(2) [1915] A.C. 120,133.
Under article 320(3)(c) however, the requirement of con- sultation with the appropriate Public Service Commission on disciplinary matters is available to "a person serving under the Government of India or the Government of a State in a civil capacity". A close scrutiny of the terminology so used shows a marked departure in the language of article 320 (3) (c) from that in articles 310 and 311. Officers and members of the staff attached to a High Court clearly fall within the scope of the phrase "persons appointed to public services and posts in connection with the affairs of the State" and also of the phrase "a person who is a member of a civil service of a State" as used in articles 3lO and 311. The salaries of these persons are paid out of the State funds as appears from article 229(3) which provides that the administrative expenses of a High Court including all salaries, allowances and pensions payable to or in respect of officers and servants of the High Court, are chargeable upon the Consolidated Fund of a State. The item relating to such administrative expenses has to form part of the annual financial statement to be presented to the State Legislative Assembly under article 202 and estimates thereof can form the subject matter of the discussion in the Legislature under article 203(1). They must, therefore, be taken "to hold posts in connection with the affairs of the State and to be members of the civil service of the State". But can it be said that members of the High Court staff are "persons serving under the Government of a State in a civil capacity"
in article 320(3) (c), the Constitution had in view the above mentioned demarcation. A close comparison of the terminology used in the corresponding provisions of the Government of India Act of 1935 also seems to confirm this demarcation. Section 290 (1) of the said Act refers to "every person who is a member of a civil service of the Crown in India or holds any civil post under the Crown in India" while section 266(3)(c) relates to "a person serving His Majesty in a civil capacity in India". A perusal of the main paragraph of sub-section (3) of section 266 clearly shows that it has reference to three cate-
gories of services (1) Secretary of States services, (2) Federal services under the Governor-General, and (3) Provincial Services under the Governor. In the context of this section, the comprehensive phrase "serving His Majesty"	Precedent
it is said that no such rules have been framed by the Chief Justice, and that therefore by virtue of section 276 of the Government of India Act, 1935, and article 313 of the Constitution, the Civil Services Rules continued to apply to him, It is necessary to examine the correctness of these assumptions.
The Civil Services Rules were framed by the Secretary of State in Council under powers vested in him by section 96- B(2) of the Government of India Act, 1915, as amended in 1919. These rules were framed on the 19th June, 1930, and published on the 21st June, 1930. It is desirable therefore to consider the position relating to the staff of the High Courts before that date. It is not disputed that the said position was governed by the Letters Patent of the High Court. Clause 8 of the Letters Patent of 1865 as amended in 1919, which continues to be operative, as also clause 4 thereof, are relevant for the present purpose. They are as follows:
There can be no doubt that this position continued at least until the Government of India Act, 1915. Now, section 106 of the Government of India Act, 1915, in terms continued the above by providing that the jurisdiction of the High Court would "include all such powers and authority over and in relation to the administration of justice including power to appoint clerks and other ministerial officers of the Court as are vested in them by Letters Patent". It follows that the position continued to be the same even under the Government of India Act, 1915, at any rate up to 1930, when the Civil Services Rules came into operation. All the powers under the Letters Patent were, however, subject to alteration by competent legislative authority by virtue of clause 44 of the Letters Patent. Clause 8 of the Letters Patent itself provided that the power of appointment of the Chief Justice was to be "subject to rules and restrictions which may be prescribed by the Governor-General in Council". Now, the Civil Services Rules were made by the Secretary of State in Council under section 96-B of the Government of India Act, 1915. It is the case of the appellant that though the Civil Services Rules framed by virtue of delegated power under the Act could not override the specific power of appointment vested in the Chief Justice by virtue of section 106 thereof, they would override the alleged implications of that power such as the power of dismissal and power to frame rules relating to conditions of service in so far as they are specifically provided for under the Civil Services Rules. It is further urged that the said situation continues up to date by virtue of section 276 of the Government of India Act, 1935 and article 313 of the Constitution, Now, the appellant is a person who was appointed in 1948 and dismissed in 1951. It is, therefore, desirable in the first instance to examine the situation under the Government of India Act, 1935 and under the Constitution of 1950 on the assumption that the Civil Services Rules made a change in the prior situation so far as the High Court staff is concerned and applied thereto between 1930 and 1935.
Under the Government of India Act, 1935, the position relating to the Civil Services of the Crown in India is contained in a number of general provisions in Chapter 11 of Part X thereof Section 240(1) reiterates what was first statutorily declared by section 96-B of the 1915 Act, viz., that except as expressly provided by the Act every, person who is a member of a civil service of the Crown in India, or holds any civil post under the Crown in India, holds office during His Majesty's pleasure. Section 241 provides for the recruitment and conditions of service of such persons and prescribes the various authorities who can make the appointments and frame the rules relating to conditions of service. Section 242(4), in so far as it is relevant for the present purpose, provides that section 241 in its application to appointments to and to persons serving on the staff attached to a High Court shall have effect as if, in the case of a High Court, for any reference to the Governor in paragraph (b) of section (1), in paragraph (a) of sub- section (2) and in sub-section (5), there was substituted a reference to the Chief Justice of the Court. Making the necessary substitutions as prescribed above, the statutory provisions in the Government of India Act, 1935, relating to recruitment and conditions of service of the staff of the High Court may be read as follows:
Now, it has to be observed that the continuance, under section 276 of the Government of India Act, 1935, of the Civil Services Rules, could only be in so far as such continuance may be consistent with the new Act. Further in their application to the High Court staff, the rules are to be deemed to be rules made under the appropriate provisions of the Act. The rules, therefore, must be deemed to be rules made by the Chief Justice consistently with the scheme and the provisions of the Act relating to the High Court staff which specifically vest in him the powers of appointment and of the regulation of conditions of service including the power of dismissal. Such continuance, therefore, can only operate by a process of adaptation implicitly Authorised by the very terms of section 276. It would follow that, in their continued application to the High Court staff, the word "Governor" has to be read as substituted by the word "Chief Justice" wherever necessary in the same way as section 242(4) of the Act requires the provisions of section 241 to be read as though any reference to the Governor therein is substituted by a reference to the Chief Justice of the High Court. The continued application of the Civil Services Rules without such adaptation would result in the anomalous position, that although the 1935 Act specifically vests in the Chief Justice the power of appointment and of framing rules regulating conditions of service including the power of dismissal and hence thereby indicates the Chief Justice as the authority having the power to exercise disciplinary control, be has no such disciplinary control merely because he did not choose to make any fresh rules and was content with the continued appli-
cation of the old rules. Now, the relevant provision in the Civil Services Rules which deals with disciplinary action including dismissal is rule 52 thereof. That rule shows that "the Governor-General in Council or Local Government of a Governor's Province may impose any of the penalties specified in rule 49 (which includes dismissal) on any person included in any of the classes I to 5 specified in rule 14 who is serving under the administrative control of the Governor-General in Council or the Local Government, as the case may be". This rule, if it originally applied to the High Court staff, must after 1935 be read by substituting "Chief Justice" in the place of "the Local Government" wherever it occurs therein and making other consequential alterations. Thus read, there can be no doubt that as from the commencement of the Government of India Act, 1935, the power of dismissal of a member of the High Court staff including, a person in the position of the appellant, -Would vest in the Chief Justice. This would be so even apart from the normal implication of the power of appointment specifically recognised under the Act. It follows that even on the assumption that Civil Services Rules applied between 1930 and 1935 to the High Court staff their continuance after 1935 makes a change in the dismissing authority and the power of dismissal is vested in the Chief Justice. That being the correct position prior to 1950, the Constitution has made no change in this respect and article 313 would also continue rule 52 of the Civil Services Rules as above adapted. It would, therefore, follow that, at any rate, from the time of passing of the Government of India Act, 1935, as also under the Constitu- tion, the power of dismissal vests in the Chief Justice notwithstanding that no specific rules have been made in this behalf by the Chief Justice.
missal. This results from section 16 of the General Clauses Act which by virtue of article 367(1) of the Constitution applies to the construction of the word "appointment" in article 229(1). Section 16 of the General Clauses Act clearly provides that the power of "appointment" includes the power "to suspend or dismiss".
of article 320(3)(c) of the Constitution. It is urged that the dismissal in the absence of consultation with the Public Service Commission of the State was invalid. There can be no doubt that members of the staff in other Government departments of the Union or the State are normally entitled to the protection of the three constitutional safeguards provided in articles 311(1), 311(2) and 320(3) (c). Article 320(3) (e) so far as it is relevant for the present purpose, runs as follows:	Section
In view of the clear conclusion we have arrived at as above, we do not consider it necessary to deal with the arguments addressed to us on both sides as to the applicability or otherwise of the Civil Services Rules to the High Court staff, including a person in the position of the appellant, and we express no opinion thereon. The main contention, therefore, of the appellant as to the competency of the Chief Justice to pass the order of dismissal against him fails.
The phrase "all disciplinary matters affecting a person"	Conclusion
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeals Nos. 245 and 202 of 1953.
Appeal under Article 132(1) of the Constitution of India from the judgment and order dated the 27th January 1953 of the Calcutta High Court in Matter No. 139 of 1952. Ranadeb Chaudhry, Anil Kumar Das Gupta and Sukumar Ghose, for the appellant.
S.M. Bose, Advocate-General,' for West Bengal (B. Sen and P. K. Bose, with him) for the respondent. 1955. December 23. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by JAGANNADHADAS J.-This is an appeal by leave of the High Court of Calcutta under article 132(1) of the Constitution. The appellant before us was the Registrar and Accountant-General of the High Court at Calcutta on its Original Side. He was appointed to the post by the Chief Justice of the High Court on the 4th March, 1948 and confirmed therein on the 15th of November, 1948. He was dismissed therefrom with effect from the 1st September, 1951, by an order of the Chief Justice dated the 3rd September, 1951. There were various charges against him and Mr. Justice Das Gupta was deputed by order of the Chief Justice dated the 28th May, 1651, to make an' enquiry and submit a report. Mr. Justice Das Gupta made a full enquiry and submitted his report on the 11th August, 1951, in which he exonerated the appellant in respect of some of the charges but found him guilty in respect of the other charges. The learned Judge expressed his conclusion as follows:
The Chief Justice issued to the appellant a notice on the 16th August, 1951, intimating that be agreed with the report after careful consideration thereof and asking him to show cause why he should Dot be dismissed from his post. The appellant was given a hearing by the Chief Justice on the 31st August, 1951. The order dated the 3rd September, 1951, of the Chief Justice dismissing the appellant from his office, a copy of which was served on him, runs as follows:
On the 25th January, 1952, the appellant submitted a petition to the Governor of West Bengal for cancellation of the above order. He received intimation dated the 9th July, 1952, that the "Governor declines to interfere on his behalf". Thereupon he filed an application to the Chief Justice for review of the prior order of dismissal. It may be mentioned that it was Chief Justice, Sir Arthur Trevor Harries, who had initiated the proceedings against the appellant and passed the order of dismissal. He retired in June, 1952. The application for review was made to the successor Chief Justice, Shri P. B. Chakravarti, on the 11th September, 1952. This application was rejected on the 16th September, 1952. Thereafter on the 24th November, 1952, i.e., more than an year after the order of dismissal, a writ application was filed on the Original Side of the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution against the Hon'ble the Chief Justice of the High Court "for calling upon him to bring up the records of the proceedings relating to his dismissal in order that justice may be done by quashing or otherwise dealing with the said proceedings and the said order dated the 3rd September, 1951, purporting to terminate his services and for directions being given to the Chief Justice to desist from giving effect to or acting in any manner under the said order". On the presentation of the application the learned Judge on the Original Side, Mr. Justice Bose, issued a rule nisi calling upon the Hon'ble the Chief Justice to show cause why an order in the nature of a writ as asked for should not be made. This order was duly served and on its return the learned Judge made an order referring the hearing of the application to a Special Bench of three Judges as per the rules of the Court. Accordingly the petition was, under the directions of the Chief Justice, heard by three learned Judges of the High Court, who after elaborate hearing and consideration of the points urged on behalf of the appellant dismissed the application. Leave to appeal to this Court was, however, granted by them under article 132(1) on the ground that the case involves substantial questions of law relating to interpretation of the Constitution.
The main points that have been urged by the appellant before us, as before the High Court, are that-
The points urged on behalf of the appellant may first be taken up. The most important out of them is the one relating to the authority of the Chief Justice to pass the order of dismissal as against the appellant. It is beyond dispute that the Chief Justice is the authority for appointing the appellant. It was in fact the Chief Justice who appointed the appellant and confirmed him. But it is strongly urged that he had not the power to dismiss. This argument is based on the assumption that the appellant falls within the category of public servants who are governed by the Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, (hereinafter referred to as the Civil Services Rules) of the year 1930 as amended from time to time and that the said rules continue to apply, to an officer holding the post which he did, even after the Government of India Act, 1935, and later the Constitution of India of 1950 successively came into force. I the argument recognises the fact that dismissal is a matter which falls within conditions of service of a public servant as held by the Privy Council in North-West Frontier Province v. Suraj Narain Anand(1) and that the power of making rules relating to conditions of service of the staff of the High Courts is vested in the Chief Justice of the Court under section 242(4) taken with section 241 of the Government of India Act, 1935, as also under article 229(2) of the Constitution of India, 1950. But (1) [1948] L.R. 75 I.A. 843.
it is said that no such rules have been framed by the Chief Justice, and that therefore by virtue of section 276 of the Government of India Act, 1935, and article 313 of the Constitution, the Civil Services Rules continued to apply to him, It is necessary to examine the correctness of these assumptions.
The Civil Services Rules were framed by the Secretary of State in Council under powers vested in him by section 96- B(2) of the Government of India Act, 1915, as amended in 1919. These rules were framed on the 19th June, 1930, and published on the 21st June, 1930. It is desirable therefore to consider the position relating to the staff of the High Courts before that date. It is not disputed that the said position was governed by the Letters Patent of the High Court. Clause 8 of the Letters Patent of 1865 as amended in 1919, which continues to be operative, as also clause 4 thereof, are relevant for the present purpose. They are as follows:
It will be noticed that clause 8 specifically vests in the Chief Justice the power of appointment, but makes no mention of the power of removal or of making regulations or provisions. But it is obvious from the last portion of clause 4 that such power was taken to be implicit under clause 8 and presumably as arising from the power of appointment.
It may be mentioned that under clause 10 of the Charter of the Supreme Court of Calcutta issued in 1774, the said Court also was in specific terms "authorized and empowered from time to time, as occasion may require, to appoint so many and such clerks and other ministerial officers as shall be found necessary for the administration of justice". The power of removal or of taking other disciplinary action as regards such appointees was not in terms granted. But there is historical evidence to show that the power of appointment conferred under the Charter was always understood as comprising the above powers. Sir Charles Wood, the then Secretary of State for India in paragraph 10 of his dispatch to the Governor-General dated the 17th May, 1862, (on the formation of the new High Courts) stated as follows:
It is this power and authority along with other judicial power and authority that was succeeded to by the High Courts (on their formation in supersession of the Supreme and Sadar Courts) by virtue of section 9 of the Indian High Courts Act, in the following terms.
Thus it is clear that both under the Charter of the Supreme Court as well as under the Letters Patent of the High Court, the power of appointment was throughout understood as vesting in the High Court or the Chief Justice, the complete administrative and disciplinary control over its staff, including the power of dismissal.
There can be no doubt that this position continued at least until the Government of India Act, 1915. Now, section 106 of the Government of India Act, 1915, in terms continued the above by providing that the jurisdiction of the High Court would "include all such powers and authority over and in relation to the administration of justice including power to appoint clerks and other ministerial officers of the Court as are vested in them by Letters Patent". It follows that the position continued to be the same even under the Government of India Act, 1915, at any rate up to 1930, when the Civil Services Rules came into operation. All the powers under the Letters Patent were, however, subject to alteration by competent legislative authority by virtue of clause 44 of the Letters Patent. Clause 8 of the Letters Patent itself provided that the power of appointment of the Chief Justice was to be "subject to rules and restrictions which may be prescribed by the Governor-General in Council". Now, the Civil Services Rules were made by the Secretary of State in Council under section 96-B of the Government of India Act, 1915. It is the case of the appellant that though the Civil Services Rules framed by virtue of delegated power under the Act could not override the specific power of appointment vested in the Chief Justice by virtue of section 106 thereof, they would override the alleged implications of that power such as the power of dismissal and power to frame rules relating to conditions of service in so far as they are specifically provided for under the Civil Services Rules. It is further urged that the said situation continues up to date by virtue of section 276 of the Government of India Act, 1935 and article 313 of the Constitution, Now, the appellant is a person who was appointed in 1948 and dismissed in 1951. It is, therefore, desirable in the first instance to examine the situation under the Government of India Act, 1935 and under the Constitution of 1950 on the assumption that the Civil Services Rules made a change in the prior situation so far as the High Court staff is concerned and applied thereto between 1930 and 1935.
Under the Government of India Act, 1935, the position relating to the Civil Services of the Crown in India is contained in a number of general provisions in Chapter 11 of Part X thereof Section 240(1) reiterates what was first statutorily declared by section 96-B of the 1915 Act, viz., that except as expressly provided by the Act every, person who is a member of a civil service of the Crown in India, or holds any civil post under the Crown in India, holds office during His Majesty's pleasure. Section 241 provides for the recruitment and conditions of service of such persons and prescribes the various authorities who can make the appointments and frame the rules relating to conditions of service. Section 242(4), in so far as it is relevant for the present purpose, provides that section 241 in its application to appointments to and to persons serving on the staff attached to a High Court shall have effect as if, in the case of a High Court, for any reference to the Governor in paragraph (b) of section (1), in paragraph (a) of sub- section (2) and in sub-section (5), there was substituted a reference to the Chief Justice of the Court. Making the necessary substitutions as prescribed above, the statutory provisions in the Government of India Act, 1935, relating to recruitment and conditions of service of the staff of the High Court may be read as follows:
These sections, while keeping intact the power of ap- pointment of the members of the staff of the High Court with the Chief Justice as contained in the Letters Patent, provide, statutorily for the first time and in express terms what was implicit in clause 8 of the Letters Patent, viz., that the power to regulate and frame rules relating to conditions of service governing such staff is also vested in the Chief Justice subject however to two limitations indicated by the provisos mentioned above. The corresponding provisions in the present Constitution relating to the powers of the Chief Justice in relation to the recruitment and service conditions of the staff of the High Court are almost identical and are contained in article
229. They are as follows:
Now, it has to be observed that the continuance, under section 276 of the Government of India Act, 1935, of the Civil Services Rules, could only be in so far as such continuance may be consistent with the new Act.

That rule shows that "the Governor-General in Council or Local Government of a Governor's Province may impose any of the penalties specified in rule 49 (which includes dismissal) on any person included in any of the classes I to 5 specified in rule 14 who is serving under the administrative control of the Governor-General in Council or the Local Government, as the case may be". This rule, if it originally applied to the High Court staff, must after 1935 be read by substituting "Chief Justice" in the place of "the Local Government" wherever it occurs therein and making other consequential alterations. Thus read, there can be no doubt that as from the commencement of the Government of India Act, 1935, the power of dismissal of a member of the High Court staff including, a person in the position of the appellant, -Would vest in the Chief Justice. This would be so even apart from the normal implication of the power of appointment specifically recognised under the Act. It follows that even on the assumption that Civil Services Rules applied between 1930 and 1935 to the High Court staff their continuance after 1935 makes a change in the dismissing authority and the power of dismissal is vested in the Chief Justice. That being the correct position prior to 1950, the Constitution has made no change in this respect and article 313 would also continue rule 52 of the Civil Services Rules as above adapted. It would, therefore, follow that, at any rate, from the time of passing of the Government of India Act, 1935, as also under the Constitu- tion, the power of dismissal vests in the Chief Justice notwithstanding that no specific rules have been made in this behalf by the Chief Justice.
It must be mentioned, at this stage, that so far as the power of dismissal is concerned, the position under the Constitution of 1950 is not open to any argument or doubt. Article 229(1) which in terms vests the power of appointment in the Chief Justice is equally effective to vest in him the power of dis-
missal. This results from section 16 of the General Clauses Act which by virtue of article 367(1) of the Constitution applies to the construction of the word "appointment" in article 229(1). Section 16 of the General Clauses Act clearly provides that the power of "appointment" includes the power "to suspend or dismiss".
In view of the clear conclusion we have arrived at as above, we do not consider it necessary to deal with the arguments addressed to us on both sides as to the applicability or otherwise of the Civil Services Rules to the High Court staff, including a person in the position of the appellant, and we express no opinion thereon. The main contention, therefore, of the appellant as to the competency of the Chief Justice to pass the order of dismissal against him fails.
The further subordinate objections that have been raised remain to be considered. The first objection that has been urged is that even if the Chief Justice had the power to dismiss, he was not, in exercise of that power, competent to delegate to another Judge the enquiry into the charges but should have made the enquiry himself. This contention proceeds on a misapprehension of the nature of the power. As pointed out in Barnard v. National Dock Labour Board(1) at page 40, it is true that "no judicial tribunal can delegate its functions unless it is enabled to do so expressly or by necessary implication". But the exercise of the power to appoint or dismiss an officer is the exercise not of a judicial power but of an administrative power. It is nonetheless so, by reason of the fact that an opportunity to show cause and an enquiry simulating judicial standards have to precede the exercise thereof It is well-recognised that a statutory functionary exercising such a power cannot be said to have delegated his functions merely by deputing a responsible and competent official to enquire and report. That is the ordinary mode of exercise of any administrative power. What cannot be delegated except where the law specifically so provides-is the ultimate responsibility for the exercise (1) [1953] 2 Q.B. 18, 40.
of such power. As pointed out by the House of Lords in Board of Education v. Rice(1), a functionary who has to decide an administrative matter, of the nature involved in this case, can obtain the material on which he is to act in such manner as may be feasible and convenient, provided only the affected party "has a fair opportunity to correct or contradict any relevant and prejudicial material". The following passage from the speech of Lord Chancellor in Local Government Board V. Arlidge (2) is apposite and in- structive.
In view of the above clear statement of the law the objection to the validity of the dismissal on the ground that the delegation of the enquiry amounts to the delegation of the power itself is without any substance and must be rejected.
The second objection that has been taken is that even if the power of dismissal is vested in the Chief Justice, the appellant was entitled to the protection (1) [1911] A.C. 179, 182.
(2) [1915] A.C. 120,133.
of article 320(3)(c) of the Constitution. It is urged that the dismissal in the absence of consultation with the Public Service Commission of the State was invalid. There can be no doubt that members of the staff in other Government departments of the Union or the State are normally entitled to the protection of the three constitutional safeguards provided in articles 311(1), 311(2) and 320(3) (c). Article 320(3) (e) so far as it is relevant for the present purpose, runs as follows:
The phrase "all disciplinary matters affecting a person"
Under article 320(3)(c) however, the requirement of con- sultation with the appropriate Public Service Commission on disciplinary matters is available to "a person serving under the Government of India or the Government of a State in a civil capacity". A close scrutiny of the terminology so used shows a marked departure in the language of article 320 (3) (c) from that in articles 310 and 311. Officers and members of the staff attached to a High Court clearly fall within the scope of the phrase "persons appointed to public services and posts in connection with the affairs of the State" and also of the phrase "a person who is a member of a civil service of a State" as used in articles 3lO and 311. The salaries of these persons are paid out of the State funds as appears from article 229(3) which provides that the administrative expenses of a High Court including all salaries, allowances and pensions payable to or in respect of officers and servants of the High Court, are chargeable upon the Consolidated Fund of a State. The item relating to such administrative expenses has to form part of the annual financial statement to be presented to the State Legislative Assembly under article 202 and estimates thereof can form the subject matter of the discussion in the Legislature under article 203(1). They must, therefore, be taken "to hold posts in connection with the affairs of the State and to be members of the civil service of the State". But can it be said that members of the High Court staff are "persons serving under the Government of a State in a civil capacity"
in article 320(3) (c), the Constitution had in view the above mentioned demarcation. A close comparison of the terminology used in the corresponding provisions of the Government of India Act of 1935 also seems to confirm this demarcation. Section 290 (1) of the said Act refers to "every person who is a member of a civil service of the Crown in India or holds any civil post under the Crown in India" while section 266(3)(c) relates to "a person serving His Majesty in a civil capacity in India". A perusal of the main paragraph of sub-section (3) of section 266 clearly shows that it has reference to three cate-
gories of services (1) Secretary of States services, (2) Federal services under the Governor-General, and (3) Provincial Services under the Governor. In the context of this section, the comprehensive phrase "serving His Majesty"	Total Judgement
