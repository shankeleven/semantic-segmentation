Konduri Buchirajalingam vs State Of Hyderabad & Ors on 3 April, 1958	Case Title
The learned Advocate contends that the proviso only makes clear what was previously implicit in the Act. By excluding from the turnover the sale of agricultural produce mentioned in it, it emphasises that an agriculturist is not a dealer within the meaning of the Act. We think that this is a misapprehension of the proviso. The proviso leaves the main portion of the definition intact and it only says that certain things shall be excluded from a person's turnover. The main portion of the definition, however, shows that "turnover" only refers to the turnover of a dealer and not of an agriculturist. Therefore, the proviso deals with a person who is both an agriculturist and a dealer and it excludes the proceeds of the sale by him of his own agriculturist produce from his turnover as a dealer in goods. It is not necessary to discuss the proviso further, for we have assumed that an agriculturist is not a dealer within the meaning of the Act.
We are however unable to agree that sections 3 and 4 do not impose a tax on a purchase by a dealer from an agriculturist. Under these sections the tax is on he turnover, that is to say, the aggregate amount for which the goods are either bought or sold. The sections no doubt limit the taxable turnover to transactions in goods which are not exempted goods. But this only means that the buying or selling, whichever is taxed, is not to be of the exempted goods. It may be pointed out here that under section 5 of the Act the tax is made payable at every point in a series of sales by successive dealers but the buyer and the seller are not both to be taxed in respect of the same transaction of sale, and where a dealer is taxed as the buyer of goods he shall not be taxed in respect of a subsequent sale by him of the same goods, and under rule 5(2) of the Rules framed under the Act, in the case of ground-nuts the turnover shall be the amount for which they were bought by the dealer. The result therefore is that under the Act tax is leviable on a sale either on the seller or on the buyer but not on both and it has been provided by rule 5(2) that in the case of sale of ground-nuts the buyer shall pay the tax provided of course he is a dealer. In respect of ground-nuts therefore tax is payable by a dealer on his turnover of purchases of these goods. The seller of these goods, whether he is an agriculturist or not, is not, in any case, as the Act and the Rules stand, liable to pay tax. For the purposes of the Act an agriculturist, not being a dealer, has no turnover. That being so, no question of exemption of the transactions by an agriculturist from the liability to pay the tax arises.The learned Advocate for the appellant then argued that his client as a registered dealer was under section 11 of the Act and rule 10 of the Rules entitled to collect the tax which was leviable upon him, from the persons from whom he purchased the goods, and as he had been prevented from collecting them from his agriculturist sellers by the order of the Government earlier mentioned, the Government was not entitled to claim any tax from him. Section 11 of the Act authorises a registered dealer to collect an amount by way of tax under it subject to the conditions and restrictions prescribed by the rules. Rule 10 states that he shall not collect any amount as tax at a rate exceeding the rates specified in it and that he shall pay the amounts so collected by him to the Government. The learned Advocate therefore points out that there is nothing in the Rules to prevent his client from collecting the tax from the agriculturist seller. We think it enough to say in regard to this contention that section 11 authorises a dealer only to collect a tax payable under the Act and where no such tax is payable, a dealer has no right to collect anything under that section. Now under the Act a dealer is liable to pay the tax and an agriculturist, not being a dealer, has no such liability. It follows that no tax can be collected from the latter. A dealer therefore has no right to collect any tax from an agriculturist under the Act. The respondents' view that the appellant had no right to collect any tax from the agriculturist was right and the appellant can make no grievance on that account.
It is contended that the words that I have underlined indicate that the Article can only apply to laws that could have been reserved for the consideration of the President at the date they were enacted. The impugned Act came into force on May 1, 1950, and at that date no question of reservation could have arisen because Parliamentary ban affecting Hyderabad was not then in force. It did not come into force till August 17, 1950.	RespArg

It is then said that the sales tax is essentially an indirect tax and therefore it cannot be demanded of the appellant without allowing him to recoup himself by collecting the amount of the tax from the persons with whom he deals. This Court has already decided in the case of Tata Iron & Steel Co. Ltd. v. The State of Bihar 1958 (9) STC 267 ), that in law a sales tax need not be an indirect tax and that a tax can be a sales tax though the primary liability for it is put upon a person without giving him any power to recoup the amount of the tax payable, from any other party. We do not think it necessary to go into the question whether the respondents were right in informing the appellant that he could recoup himself of the amount paid by him as tax by collecting the tax from the persons to whom he in his turn sold the ground-nuts or if he converted them into oil, by adding the amount of the tax to the price of the oil, for the primary liability for the tax was on the appellant and it made no difference whether he was able to recoup himself the amount paid or not.The last point of the learned Advocate for the appellant is that, ground-nuts had been declared an essential commodity by Parliament and therefore under Article 286(3) of the Constitution no tax was leviable in respect of it. That provision in the Constitution, which was later repealed, was in these terms :	Precedent
It was pointed out that the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act (Act XXIV of 1946) was extended to Hyderabad with effect from August 17, 1950, by a Notification made under Act LII of 1950. It is said that this Act declared ground-nuts to be an essential commodity. Therefore, it is said, a sale of ground-nuts was not liable to be taxed under the Hyderabad General Sales Tax Act as it had neither been reserved for the consideration of the President nor received his assent. The contention of the learned Advocate for the appellant is, in our view, unsustainable. The law declaring goods to be essential for the life of the community contemplated by Article 286(3) is a law of the "Parliament" and therefore a law passed after the Constitution came into force, Act XXIV of 1946 was passed before the Constitution had been promulgated and is therefore not such a law. But it is said that it was applied to Hyderabad by a Parliamentary law, namely, Act LII of 1950, and therefore as applied to Hyderabad it became a Parliamentary law. We are not sure that this argument is correct but we think it unnecessary to discuss it here. We will assume for the purposes of the present case that it is correct. Even then it does not seem to us that Act XXIV of 1946 is a Parliamentary law declaring goods to be essential as contemplated by Article 286(3). The law of Parliament declaring goods to be essential contemplated by clause (3) of Article 286 is a law making a declaration for the purposes of that clause. An Act like the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act of 1946, which declares certain goods essential for its own purposes is not a law within the meaning of the provision in the Constitution. Section 3(1) of Act XXIV of 1946 shows why the Act declared certain goods to be essential commodities. That section is in these terms :
The object of the declaration by the Act of goods as essential was not to prevent sales tax being levied on them. The Act had nothing to do with Article 286(3) of the Constitution and in fact did not declare any goods to be essential for the life of the community at all. It therefore seems to us that Act XXIV of 1946 was not an Act declaring any commodity essential for the life of the community within the contemplation of Article 286(3). In our view, any Act of Parliament declaring certain goods to be essential for its own purposes, as Act XXIV of 1946 does, is not an Act within the contemplation of Article 286(3). The Parliamentary Act, there contemplated, has to be passed in exercise of the powers contained in it and must clearly be referable to it. In fact such an Act was later passed by Parliament. That was "The Essential Goods (Declaration and Regulation of Tax on Sale or Purchase) Act, LII of 1952 "	Section
I am not able to construe Article 286(3) in that way. What does it say ?
Was this law reserved ? The answer is no. What does it matter why it was not reserved ? The fact remains that it was not reserved and if it was not reserved, the Article says clearly and simply that it shall not take effect. In my judgment, this means that on and from the date of a Parliamentary declaration no law existing or future can take effect. To hold otherwise would land the country in this absurdity. At a certain date it is not considered necessary to regulate or control the production etc. of a given commodity. Therefore, States are free to tax sales and purchases that relate to them. An emergency arises and a ban on certain taxation becomes essential for so important a thing as the life of the community and yet, according to this view, Parliament will have no power to regulate the matter simply because control was unnecessary before the emergency. I would hesitate to hold that and prefer to apply the words of Article 286(3) as they stand without subtlety or refinement.If this correct, then the appeal must succeed and, with the utmost respect, I would so hold.
Order BY THE COURT : In accordance with the opinion of the majority the appeal is dismissed with costs.	Conclusion
