The Tinnevelly-Tuticorin ... vs Its Workmen on 22 February, 1960	Case Title
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 23 of 1958. Appeal by special leave from the decision dated September 29, 1956, of the Labour Appellate Tribunal, Bombay, in Appeal (Mad.) No. 96 of 1956, arising out of the Award dated April 9, 1956, of the Industrial Tribunal., Madras, in I.D. No. 52 of 1954.
T. S. Venkataraman and M. K. Ramamurth, for the respondents.
1960. February, 22. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by GAJENDRAGADKAR, J.-The appellant, the Tinnevelli-Tuticorin Electric Supply Co., Ltd., Tuticorin, is an electric supply undertaking, and it carries on its business as a licensee under the State Government of Madras subject to the provisions of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910 (Act 9 of 1910) and the Electric Supply Act, 1948 (Act 54 of 1948). This latter Act will hereinafter be called the Act. The business of the appellant consists of buying electric supply from the State Hydro-electric Projects and of supplying the same to consumers within the areas specified in its licence; this area is in and around Tinnevelli and Tuticorin Municipalities. The appellant's workmen (hereinafter called the respondents) made several demands in respect of their terms of employment. These demands gave rise to an industrial dispute which was referred by the Madras Government to the Industrial Tribunal at Madurai for adjudication under s. 10(1)(c) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (XIV of 1947). Amongst the items thus referred for adjudication was included the respondents' claim for additional bonus for the year 1952-
The special bench of the appellate tribunal then heard the group of appeals including the appeal preferred by the appellant. It held that bonus could be ordered to be paid notwithstanding the limitations of the Act, and that the quantum of bonus should be determined even in the case of electricity concerns or undertakings by the application of the Full Bench formula laid down in that behalf. Having decided the question of law in this manner, the appeals were remanded to the respective benches of the Labour Appellate Tribunal for disposal in accordance with law. The appeal preferred by the appellant was in due course taken up by the Industrial Tribunal at Madras the Industrial Tribunal at Madurai having been in the meanwhile abolished and the appeals on its file transferred to the Industrial Tribunal at Madras. This latter tribunal considered the merits of the contentions raised by the parties, applied the Full Bench formula, and ultimately passed an award on April 9, 1956, directing the appellant to pay 'an additional bonus of two months' basic wages to the respondents. Thereupon the appellant preferred another appeal to the Labour Appellate Tribunal, and it was numbered as Appeal (Madras) No. 96 of 1956. Certain contentions were raised before the appellate tribunal on the merits, and it was urged that the direction to pay an additional bonus of two months basic wages was improper and unjustified. The appellate tribunal negatived most of the contentions raised by the appellant, but it was satisfied that the calculation made by the tribunal in regard to the quantum of available surplus was erroneous, and so, after rectifying the said error, it held that the additional bonus which the appellant should pay to the respondents was one month's basic wage. It is against this decision of the appellate tribunal that the present appeal by special leave has been filed by the appellant before this Court. The main question which the appeal raises for our decision is whether the fuller bench of the Labour Appellate Tribunal was justified in holding that the Full Bench formula can and should be applied in adjudicating upon the respondents' claim for bonus against the appellant.
Incidentally, we may point out that the fuller bench of the Labour Appellate Tribunal in the case of U. P. Electricity Supply Co. Ltd. & Ors. v. Their Workmen (1) has decided two questions of law. The first was in regard to the applicability of the Full Bench formula to the employees' claim for bonus against their employers carrying on the business of the supply of electricity, and the second was in regard to the extent of the statutory depreciation allowed by the Full Bench formula. The question was whether it should not include initial depreciation and additional depreciation which are given for the purpose of allowing relief in the matter of taxation under s. 10(2) (vi-b) of the Income-tax Act. The fuller bench had decided that in allowing a prior charge in the (1) (1955) L.A.C. 659.	Issue
A. V. Viswanatha Sastri, and Naunit Lal, for the appellants.
Before the industrial tribunal the appellant contended that since it was working as a licensee under the Act no claim for bonus was admissible outside the provisions of the Act. In support of this plea the appellant relied on the scheme of the Act which restricted the profit-making of the electricity concerns to a prescribed limit with a possibility of a surplus only in cases of overcharging provided for in the rules. The appellant's case was that, having regard to the scheme, object and the background of the Act under which the appellant was carrying on its busi- ness, the respondent's claim for additional bonus was wholly misconceived. No claim for bonus can be entertained, it was urged on behalf of the appellant, without reference to the provisions of the Act which governs the business of the appellant.
The tribunal, however, rejected the appellant's contentions and held that the appellant was liable to pay two months' basic wages as additional bonus to the respondents. This award was passed on March 4, 1955. Against this award the appellant preferred an appeal, No. 56 of 1955, to the Labour Appellate Tribunal, and contended that no additional bonus should have been awarded in the absence of proof of an excess of "clear profits over reasonable return" ; it was the appellant's case that it was only from excess of clear profits over reasonable return as defined by the Act that bonus can be legitimately awarded to the respondents. It appears that about this time a number of appeals raising the same question were pending before the Labour Appellate Tribunal, and decisions given by the Labour Appellate Tribunal showed divergence of opinion on the question about the effect of the Act in respect of the claim for bonus made by employees of electricity concerns and undertakings. That is why the Chairman of the Labour Appellate Tribunal issued an administrative order that all appeals which raised the said question should be grouped together and posted for hearing before a specially constituted fuller bench of five members. The Chairman thought that a decision by a fuller bench would finally resolve the apparent conflict disclosed in several decisions pronounced thereto, and give proper guidance to the tribunals in future.
It is necessary at this stage to refer briefly to some of the provisions contained in the Sixth Schedule, because Mr. Viswanatha Sastri, for the appellant, has relied on the scheme of the said Schedule in support of his principal argument. These provisions prescribe the financial principles which have to be followed by the electricity concerns and undertakings covered by the Act. It is urged by the appellant that these principles along with the rest of the Schedules and the provisions of the Act constitute a self-contained code which govern the business and the financial affairs of electricity concerns, and as such even the claim of the appellant's employees for bonus must be dealt with in the light of these provisions. Paragraph 1 of Sixth Schedule provides:-	PetArg
53. Without prejudice to its contention that the appellant was not liable to pay bonus it had in fact voluntarily paid two months' basic wages by way of bonus to the respondents. The respondents, however, claimed additional bonus and this claim was one of the items of dispute referred to the tribunal for its adjudication.	RespArg
working of the formula it is only the normal incometax depreciation (including multiple shift depreciation) that should be allowed. The correctness of this latter decision was challenged before this Court in Sree Meenakshi Mills Ltd. v. Their Workmen (1) but the challenge failed and the decision of the fuller bench was confirmed. In the present appeal it is the correctness of the fuller bench decision on the first question which is challenged before us. Let us being by stating briefly the appellant's contention. It is urged on behalf of the appellant that it is only where the " clear profits " are in 'excess of the " reasonable return " under the Act that a case for the payment of bonus can really arise in regard to the electricity concerns and undertakings. The Act is a self-contained code intended to regulate the business and affairs of electricity concerns including the claim of their employees for bonus, and as such an industrial dispute between such concerns and their employees in regard to bonus must be determined solely by reference to the provisions of the Act and and not by the application of the Full Bench formula. As to the quantum of bonus which should be awarded it would depend upon the circumstances in each case; but it is urged that it may as an ad hoe measure be decided that 1/4th of the excess between clear profits and the reasonable return may be taken as a fair quantum of bonus which electricity concerns should be ordered to pay to their employees. Before dealing with the validity of this argument it is necessary to examine the scheme of the Act. -
(1) [1458] S. C. R. 878.
This provision is made subject to four provisos which it is unnecessary to mention.
In dealing with this contention it is necessary to bear in mind that the fields covered by the Full Bench formula and by the provisions of the Act are entirely different. The Full Bench formula has been evolved by industrial adjudication for the purpose of doing social justice to workmen and it is. now well-established that the workmen's claim for bonus is justified on the ground that they contribute to the employer's profit and are entitled to claim a share in the said profit with a view to fill the gap between their actual wages and the living wage which they aspire to earn. On the other hand, the Act does not purport to deal with this problem at all. It is significant that though the Act makes detailed provisions in respect of matters intended to be covered by it, it does not refer to the wages which the employer may have to pay to his employees. Can it be said that in fixing the wage. structure as between an electricity undertaking and its employees considerations of social justice would be irrelevant? In fixing such wage-structure none of the provisions of the Act can afford the slightest assistance to industrial tribunals. That task must be attempted by the tribunals in the light of principles of social justice and other relevant considerations such as the capacity of the employer to pay and the wages received by employees in comparable trades in the same region. Just as the problem of wage-structure has to be solved in the case of electricity concerns apart from the provisions of the Act and in the light of the relevant industrial principles, so must the problem of bonus be resolved in the like manner. There is really no conflict between the Act and the principles of industrial adjudication. In fact they cover different fields and their relevance and validity is beyond question in their respective fields.
In this connection it may be useful to refer to the decision of this Court in the case of Baroda Borough Municipality v. Its Workmen (1). One of the points raised on behalf of the Baroda Borough Municipality in resisting the claim for bonus by its workmen was that the scheme of the Bombay Municipal Boroughs Act 18 of 1925 by which the Municipality was governed did not permit the making of any claim for bonus :
observed, "is not dealt with by the Municipal Act; it is dealt with by the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. Therefore, it is not a relevant consideration whether there are provisions in the Municipal Act with regard to bonus. The provisions of the Municipal Act are relevant only for the purpose of determining the quality or the nature of the municipal property or fund; those provisions cannot be stretched beyond their limited purpose for defeating a claim of bonus ". That is why this Court came to the conclusion that the absence of provisions in the Municipal Acts for payment of bonus to municipal employees was not a consideration which was either determinative or conclusive of the question at issue before it.	Precedent
Let us first consider some of the provisions in the Indian Electricity Act 9 of 1910 which may be relevant. Section 3(2)(d)(i) provides that the State Government may, on an application made in the prescribed form, and on payment of the prescribed fee (if any), grant, after consulting the State Electricity Board, a licence to any person, and that the said licence may prescribe such terms as to the limits within which and conditions under which, the supply ,of energy is to be compulsory or permissive, and generally as to such matters as the State Govern-
ment may think fit. Section 3(f) provides that the provisions contained in the Schedule shall be deemed to be Incorporated with, and to form part of, every licence granted under this Part, except as in the manner therein described. Section 4(1)(b) empowers the State Government inter alia to revoke the licence where the licensee breaks any of the terms or the conditions of his licence the breach of which is expressly declared by such licence to render it liable to revocation. Section 7(1) provides to the authorities specified in it option to purchase the undertaking. Section 11 requires the licensee to prepare and render to the State Government or to such authority as the State Government may appoint in that behalf, on or before the prescribed date in each year an annual statement of account of his undertaking made up to such date, in such form and containing such particulars, as may be prescribed in that behalf. Section 22 imposes on the licensee obligation to supply energy subject to the conditions prescribed ; and s. 23 provides that a licensee shall not, in making any agreement for the supply of energy, show undue preference to any person. The licensee cannot also charge for such supply any rates higher than those permitted. The appropriate Government is authorised to fix the maximum charges, and by appropriate rules both the maximum and minimum charges have been prescribed. These are the relevant provisions of Act 9 of 1910.
Let us now refer to some of the relevant provisions of the Act. Section 57 provides the licensee's charges to consumers. According to it the provisions of the Sixth Schedule and the Seventh Schedule shall be deemed to be incorporated in the licence of every licensee, not being a local authority, in the manner specified by it. This section further provides inter alia that as from the specified date the licensee shall comply with the provisions of the said Schedules and not provisions of Act 9 of 1910, and the licence granted to him thereunder and of any other law, agreement or instrument applicable to the licensee shall, in relation to the licence, be void and of no effect in so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of s. 57A and the said Schedules. Section 57 deals with the licensee's charges to the consumers and lays down provisions which shall have effect in relation to the licence where the provisions of the Sixth Schedule and the table appended to the Seventh Schedule are under sub-s. (1) deemed to be incorporated in the said licence. These provisions relate to the appointment of the Board and the rating committee. Section 57A prescribes the principles and the procedure which has to be followed by the rating committee in making its report to the State Government regarding the charges for electricity which the licensee may make to any class or classes of consumers. This provision gives us an idea as to the object which the Legislature had in mind in ultimately fixing the minimum and maximum rates chargeable to the consumers. Sections 78 and 79 provide for power to make rules and regulations. Nine Schedules are attached to the Act. Schedule Six deals with the financial principles and their application; Schedule Seven deals with the depreciation of assets; Schedule Eight provides for the determination of cost of production of electricity at generating stations; and schedule Nine prescribes the method for allocation of costs of production at generating stations.
Paragraph 2 reads thus:-
Paragraph 17(9) defines a reasonable return as meaning :-
It would thus be clear that the provisions of the Act in general and those of the Sixth Schedule in particular, are no doubt intended to control and regulate the rates chargeable to consumers and to provide the method and the machinery by which the electrical system of the country could be properly coordinated and integrated. The rates chargeable are fixed, so is a reasonable return provided for. But it is not as if the Act intends to guarantee a minimum return to the undertaking. What it purports to do is to prohibit - a return higher than the one specified. Appropriations permissible under revenue receipts are also defined and enumerated and a clear profit as contemplated by the Act is also prescribed and defined. Large powers have been given to the Electricity Authority, Boards and Councils for the purpose of canalising the activities of the concerns as well as for adjusting their activities for changing conditions and circumstances. Just as the Act has made provision for the control of rates chargeable to consumers its policy also is to give a fair deal to the undertaking and persons engaged in the business of supplying electricity. 'It is with this twin object that a working- sheet is required to be prepared under the provisions of the Act. It is, however, clear that the working-sheet thus prescribed is essentially different from the balance-sheet and profit and loss account which companies keep under the provisions of the Companies Act. The determination of clear profits on the basis of the working-sheet ::proceeds on the consideration of previous losses, contributions towards the arrears of depreciation and several appropriations authorised by the State Government, matters which have no relevance to commercial accounting. The principles of commercial accounting on which the balance, sheets are prepared and profit and loss account made are very different from the principles on which the working-sheet as specified in the Act is required to be prepared. The question which arises for our decision is whether the appellant is right in contending that the present dispute arising from the respondents' claim for bonus must be decided by the provisions of the Act alone and that the Full Bench formula is wholly inapplicable for the purpose.
The next question which arises is whether a claim for bonus can be said to be included under paragraph 17 (2) (b) (xi). This provision includes under expenditure other expenses admissible under the law for the time being in force in the assessment of Indian Income-tax and arising from. and ancillary or incidental to, the business of electricity supply. It is admitted that bonus paid by an employer to his employees constitutes expenses admissible under section 10(2)(vi) of the Income-tax Act, but it is urged that it is not an expense which can be said to arise from, and ancillary or incidental to, the business of electricity supply. The argument is that cl. (xi) lays down two tests, one of which is satisfied viz., that it is expense admissible under the lndian Income-tax Act, but the other is not satisfied, and so the clause is inapplicable to the amount paid by way of bonus. The appellate tribunal has held that even the other test is satisfied and that the expenditure in question can be said to arise from, or to be ancillary, or incidental to, the business of electricity supply. In our opinion, it is difficult to accept the appellant's argument that the construction placed by the appellate tribunal on the latter part of this clause is not reasonably possible. Besides, it may be relevant to point out that by a subsequent amendment made in 1957 cl. (xiii) has been added under paragraph 17(2)(b) of the Sixth Schedule. This clause which is numbered (xiii) reads thus:	Section

1960. February, 22. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by GAJENDRAGADKAR, J.-The appellant, the Tinnevelli-Tuticorin Electric Supply Co., Ltd., Tuticorin, is an electric supply undertaking, and it carries on its business as a licensee under the State Government of Madras subject to the provisions of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910 (Act 9 of 1910) and the Electric Supply Act, 1948 (Act 54 of 1948). This latter Act will hereinafter be called the Act. The business of the appellant consists of buying electric supply from the State Hydro-electric Projects and of supplying the same to consumers within the areas specified in its licence; this area is in and around Tinnevelli and Tuticorin Municipalities. The appellant's workmen (hereinafter called the respondents) made several demands in respect of their terms of employment. These demands gave rise to an industrial dispute which was referred by the Madras Government to the Industrial Tribunal at Madurai for adjudication under s. 10(1)(c) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (XIV of 1947). Amongst the items thus referred for adjudication was included the respondents' claim for additional bonus for the year 1952-
53. Without prejudice to its contention that the appellant was not liable to pay bonus it had in fact voluntarily paid two months' basic wages by way of bonus to the respondents. The respondents, however, claimed additional bonus and this claim was one of the items of dispute referred to the tribunal for its adjudication.
Before the industrial tribunal the appellant contended that since it was working as a licensee under the Act no claim for bonus was admissible outside the provisions of the Act. In support of this plea the appellant relied on the scheme of the Act which restricted the profit-making of the electricity concerns to a prescribed limit with a possibility of a surplus only in cases of overcharging provided for in the rules. The appellant's case was that, having regard to the scheme, object and the background of the Act under which the appellant was carrying on its busi- ness, the respondent's claim for additional bonus was wholly misconceived. No claim for bonus can be entertained, it was urged on behalf of the appellant, without reference to the provisions of the Act which governs the business of the appellant.
The tribunal, however, rejected the appellant's contentions and held that the appellant was liable to pay two months' basic wages as additional bonus to the respondents. This award was passed on March 4, 1955. Against this award the appellant preferred an appeal, No. 56 of 1955, to the Labour Appellate Tribunal, and contended that no additional bonus should have been awarded in the absence of proof of an excess of "clear profits over reasonable return" ; it was the appellant's case that it was only from excess of clear profits over reasonable return as defined by the Act that bonus can be legitimately awarded to the respondents. It appears that about this time a number of appeals raising the same question were pending before the Labour Appellate Tribunal, and decisions given by the Labour Appellate Tribunal showed divergence of opinion on the question about the effect of the Act in respect of the claim for bonus made by employees of electricity concerns and undertakings. That is why the Chairman of the Labour Appellate Tribunal issued an administrative order that all appeals which raised the said question should be grouped together and posted for hearing before a specially constituted fuller bench of five members. The Chairman thought that a decision by a fuller bench would finally resolve the apparent conflict disclosed in several decisions pronounced thereto, and give proper guidance to the tribunals in future.
The special bench of the appellate tribunal then heard the group of appeals including the appeal preferred by the appellant. It held that bonus could be ordered to be paid notwithstanding the limitations of the Act, and that the quantum of bonus should be determined even in the case of electricity concerns or undertakings by the application of the Full Bench formula laid down in that behalf. Having decided the question of law in this manner, the appeals were remanded to the respective benches of the Labour Appellate Tribunal for disposal in accordance with law. The appeal preferred by the appellant was in due course taken up by the Industrial Tribunal at Madras the Industrial Tribunal at Madurai having been in the meanwhile abolished and the appeals on its file transferred to the Industrial Tribunal at Madras. This latter tribunal considered the merits of the contentions raised by the parties, applied the Full Bench formula, and ultimately passed an award on April 9, 1956, directing the appellant to pay 'an additional bonus of two months' basic wages to the respondents. Thereupon the appellant preferred another appeal to the Labour Appellate Tribunal, and it was numbered as Appeal (Madras) No. 96 of 1956. Certain contentions were raised before the appellate tribunal on the merits, and it was urged that the direction to pay an additional bonus of two months basic wages was improper and unjustified.

It is against this decision of the appellate tribunal that the present appeal by special leave has been filed by the appellant before this Court. The main question which the appeal raises for our decision is whether the fuller bench of the Labour Appellate Tribunal was justified in holding that the Full Bench formula can and should be applied in adjudicating upon the respondents' claim for bonus against the appellant.
Incidentally, we may point out that the fuller bench of the Labour Appellate Tribunal in the case of U. P. Electricity Supply Co. Ltd. & Ors. v. Their Workmen (1) has decided two questions of law. The first was in regard to the applicability of the Full Bench formula to the employees' claim for bonus against their employers carrying on the business of the supply of electricity, and the second was in regard to the extent of the statutory depreciation allowed by the Full Bench formula. The question was whether it should not include initial depreciation and additional depreciation which are given for the purpose of allowing relief in the matter of taxation under s. 10(2) (vi-b) of the Income-tax Act. The fuller bench had decided that in allowing a prior charge in the (1) (1955) L.A.C. 659.
working of the formula it is only the normal incometax depreciation (including multiple shift depreciation) that should be allowed. The correctness of this latter decision was challenged before this Court in Sree Meenakshi Mills Ltd. v. Their Workmen (1) but the challenge failed and the decision of the fuller bench was confirmed. In the present appeal it is the correctness of the fuller bench decision on the first question which is challenged before us. Let us being by stating briefly the appellant's contention. It is urged on behalf of the appellant that it is only where the " clear profits " are in 'excess of the " reasonable return " under the Act that a case for the payment of bonus can really arise in regard to the electricity concerns and undertakings. The Act is a self-contained code intended to regulate the business and affairs of electricity concerns including the claim of their employees for bonus, and as such an industrial dispute between such concerns and their employees in regard to bonus must be determined solely by reference to the provisions of the Act and and not by the application of the Full Bench formula.

Let us first consider some of the provisions in the Indian Electricity Act 9 of 1910 which may be relevant. Section 3(2)(d)(i) provides that the State Government may, on an application made in the prescribed form, and on payment of the prescribed fee (if any), grant, after consulting the State Electricity Board, a licence to any person, and that the said licence may prescribe such terms as to the limits within which and conditions under which, the supply ,of energy is to be compulsory or permissive, and generally as to such matters as the State Govern-
(1) [1458] S. C. R. 878.
ment may think fit. Section 3(f) provides that the provisions contained in the Schedule shall be deemed to be Incorporated with, and to form part of, every licence granted under this Part, except as in the manner therein described. Section 4(1)(b) empowers the State Government inter alia to revoke the licence where the licensee breaks any of the terms or the conditions of his licence the breach of which is expressly declared by such licence to render it liable to revocation. Section 7(1) provides to the authorities specified in it option to purchase the undertaking. Section 11 requires the licensee to prepare and render to the State Government or to such authority as the State Government may appoint in that behalf, on or before the prescribed date in each year an annual statement of account of his undertaking made up to such date, in such form and containing such particulars, as may be prescribed in that behalf. Section 22 imposes on the licensee obligation to supply energy subject to the conditions prescribed ; and s. 23 provides that a licensee shall not, in making any agreement for the supply of energy, show undue preference to any person. The licensee cannot also charge for such supply any rates higher than those permitted. The appropriate Government is authorised to fix the maximum charges, and by appropriate rules both the maximum and minimum charges have been prescribed. These are the relevant provisions of Act 9 of 1910.
Let us now refer to some of the relevant provisions of the Act. Section 57 provides the licensee's charges to consumers. According to it the provisions of the Sixth Schedule and the Seventh Schedule shall be deemed to be incorporated in the licence of every licensee, not being a local authority, in the manner specified by it. This section further provides inter alia that as from the specified date the licensee shall comply with the provisions of the said Schedules and not provisions of Act 9 of 1910, and the licence granted to him thereunder and of any other law, agreement or instrument applicable to the licensee shall, in relation to the licence, be void and of no effect in so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of s. 57A and the said Schedules. Section 57 deals with the licensee's charges to the consumers and lays down provisions which shall have effect in relation to the licence where the provisions of the Sixth Schedule and the table appended to the Seventh Schedule are under sub-s. (1) deemed to be incorporated in the said licence. These provisions relate to the appointment of the Board and the rating committee. Section 57A prescribes the principles and the procedure which has to be followed by the rating committee in making its report to the State Government regarding the charges for electricity which the licensee may make to any class or classes of consumers. This provision gives us an idea as to the object which the Legislature had in mind in ultimately fixing the minimum and maximum rates chargeable to the consumers. Sections 78 and 79 provide for power to make rules and regulations. Nine Schedules are attached to the Act. Schedule Six deals with the financial principles and their application; Schedule Seven deals with the depreciation of assets; Schedule Eight provides for the determination of cost of production of electricity at generating stations; and schedule Nine prescribes the method for allocation of costs of production at generating stations.
It is necessary at this stage to refer briefly to some of the provisions contained in the Sixth Schedule, because Mr. Viswanatha Sastri, for the appellant, has relied on the scheme of the said Schedule in support of his principal argument. These provisions prescribe the financial principles which have to be followed by the electricity concerns and undertakings covered by the Act. It is urged by the appellant that these principles along with the rest of the Schedules and the provisions of the Act constitute a self-contained code which govern the business and the financial affairs of electricity concerns, and as such even the claim of the appellant's employees for bonus must be dealt with in the light of these provisions. Paragraph 1 of Sixth Schedule provides:-
This provision is made subject to four provisos which it is unnecessary to mention.
Paragraph 2 reads thus:-
Paragraph 3 provides for the creation from existing reserve or from the revenue of the undertaking a reserve to be called Contingencies Reserve. Paragraph 4 prescribes the manner in which the licensee shall appropriate to Contingencies Reserve from the revenues of each year of account. Paragraph 6 directs that there shall be allowed in each year in respect of depreciation of fixed assets employed in the business of electricity supply such an amount as would if set aside annually throughout the prescribed period and accumulated at compound interest at 4 per cent. per anum, produce by the end of the prescribed period amount equal to 90 per cent. of the original cost of the asset after taking into account the sums already written off or set aside in the books of the undertaking; annual interest on the accumulated balance will be allowed as expense from revenue as well as the annual incremental deposit. Paragraph 7 deals with assets which have ceased to be avilable for use through obsolescence, inadequacy, superfluity or for any other reason, and it allows the licensee to describe the said assets as no longer in use, and no further depreciation in respect thereof shall be allowed as a charge against the revenue. Paragraph 8 prohi- bits any further depreciation where an asset has been written down in the books of the undertaking to 10 per cent. or less of its original cost. Under paragraph 9, where a fixed asset is sold for a price exceeding its written down cost, the excess has to be credited to the Contingencies Reserve. Paragraph 10 requires the consent of the State Government to carry sums to a reserve or to declare a dividend in excess of 3 per cent. on share capital or other matters specified therein. Paragraph 13 imposes limitations in respect -of ordinary remunerations of managing agents; whereas paragraph 14 provides that the Board of Directors shall not contain more than 10 directors; and paragraph 15 prescribes the way in which the licensee can make any capital expenditure which exceeds Rs. 25,000 or 2 per cent. of the capital base within three years before the next option of purchase under the licence arises. Paragraph 16 contains an arbitration clause. Paragraph 17 gives definitions for the purpose of this Schedule. Capital base is defined by paragraph 17(1); clear profit is defined by paragraph 17(2) as meaning the difference between the amount of income and the sum of expenditure plus specific appropriations made up in each case as prescribed in several sub-clauses of clauses (a), (b) and (c). It is necessary to refer to two sub-clauses under clause (b) :-
Paragraph 17(9) defines a reasonable return as meaning :-
It would thus be clear that the provisions of the Act in general and those of the Sixth Schedule in particular, are no doubt intended to control and regulate the rates chargeable to consumers and to provide the method and the machinery by which the electrical system of the country could be properly coordinated and integrated. The rates chargeable are fixed, so is a reasonable return provided for. But it is not as if the Act intends to guarantee a minimum return to the undertaking. What it purports to do is to prohibit - a return higher than the one specified. Appropriations permissible under revenue receipts are also defined and enumerated and a clear profit as contemplated by the Act is also prescribed and defined. Large powers have been given to the Electricity Authority, Boards and Councils for the purpose of canalising the activities of the concerns as well as for adjusting their activities for changing conditions and circumstances. Just as the Act has made provision for the control of rates chargeable to consumers its policy also is to give a fair deal to the undertaking and persons engaged in the business of supplying electricity. 'It is with this twin object that a working- sheet is required to be prepared under the provisions of the Act. It is, however, clear that the working-sheet thus prescribed is essentially different from the balance-sheet and profit and loss account which companies keep under the provisions of the Companies Act. The determination of clear profits on the basis of the working-sheet ::proceeds on the consideration of previous losses, contributions towards the arrears of depreciation and several appropriations authorised by the State Government, matters which have no relevance to commercial accounting. The principles of commercial accounting on which the balance, sheets are prepared and profit and loss account made are very different from the principles on which the working-sheet as specified in the Act is required to be prepared. The question which arises for our decision is whether the appellant is right in contending that the present dispute arising from the respondents' claim for bonus must be decided by the provisions of the Act alone and that the Full Bench formula is wholly inapplicable for the purpose.
In dealing with this contention it is necessary to bear in mind that the fields covered by the Full Bench formula and by the provisions of the Act are entirely different. The Full Bench formula has been evolved by industrial adjudication for the purpose of doing social justice to workmen and it is. now well-established that the workmen's claim for bonus is justified on the ground that they contribute to the employer's profit and are entitled to claim a share in the said profit with a view to fill the gap between their actual wages and the living wage which they aspire to earn. On the other hand, the Act does not purport to deal with this problem at all. It is significant that though the Act makes detailed provisions in respect of matters intended to be covered by it, it does not refer to the wages which the employer may have to pay to his employees. Can it be said that in fixing the wage. structure as between an electricity undertaking and its employees considerations of social justice would be irrelevant? In fixing such wage-structure none of the provisions of the Act can afford the slightest assistance to industrial tribunals. That task must be attempted by the tribunals in the light of principles of social justice and other relevant considerations such as the capacity of the employer to pay and the wages received by employees in comparable trades in the same region. Just as the problem of wage-structure has to be solved in the case of electricity concerns apart from the provisions of the Act and in the light of the relevant industrial principles, so must the problem of bonus be resolved in the like manner. There is really no conflict between the Act and the principles of industrial adjudication. In fact they cover different fields and their relevance and validity is beyond question in their respective fields.
As we have just indicated the method of accounting required by the Act in preparing the working-sheet is substantially different from the commercial method of accounting which yields the gross profits in the form of profit and loss account. Determination of gross profit is the first step which industrial tribunals take in applying the Full Bench formula. Such gross profit cannot be ascertained from the working-sheet prepared under the Act. It is not denied that the appellant has to keep accounts under the Companies Act on a commercial basis. That being so, in dealing with the respondents claim for bonus, it is the balance-sheet and the profit and loss account , prepared by the appellant that must be taken as the basis in the present proceedings, and that is precisely what the tribunals below have done. Therefore, we are satisfied that the Labour Appellate Tribunal was right in coming to the conclusion that the respondents' claim for bonus must be governed by the application of the Full Bench formula.
In this connection it may be useful to refer to the decision of this Court in the case of Baroda Borough Municipality v. Its Workmen (1). One of the points raised on behalf of the Baroda Borough Municipality in resisting the claim for bonus by its workmen was that the scheme of the Bombay Municipal Boroughs Act 18 of 1925 by which the Municipality was governed did not permit the making of any claim for bonus :
observed, "is not dealt with by the Municipal Act; it is dealt with by the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. Therefore, it is not a relevant consideration whether there are provisions in the Municipal Act with regard to bonus. The provisions of the Municipal Act are relevant only for the purpose of determining the quality or the nature of the municipal property or fund; those provisions cannot be stretched beyond their limited purpose for defeating a claim of bonus ". That is why this Court came to the conclusion that the absence of provisions in the Municipal Acts for payment of bonus to municipal employees was not a consideration which was either determinative or conclusive of the question at issue before it.
The next question which arises is whether a claim for bonus can be said to be included under paragraph 17 (2) (b) (xi). This provision includes under expenditure other expenses admissible under the law for the time being in force in the assessment of Indian Income-tax and arising from. and ancillary or incidental to, the business of electricity supply. It is admitted that bonus paid by an employer to his employees constitutes expenses admissible under section 10(2)(vi) of the Income-tax Act, but it is urged that it is not an expense which can be said to arise from, and ancillary or incidental to, the business of electricity supply. The argument is that cl. (xi) lays down two tests, one of which is satisfied viz., that it is expense admissible under the lndian Income-tax Act, but the other is not satisfied, and so the clause is inapplicable to the amount paid by way of bonus. The appellate tribunal has held that even the other test is satisfied and that the expenditure in question can be said to arise from, or to be ancillary, or incidental to, the business of electricity supply. In our opinion, it is difficult to accept the appellant's argument that the construction placed by the appellate tribunal on the latter part of this clause is not reasonably possible. Besides, it may be relevant to point out that by a subsequent amendment made in 1957 cl. (xiii) has been added under paragraph 17(2)(b) of the Sixth Schedule. This clause which is numbered (xiii) reads thus:	Total Judgement
