Kamala Devi vs Bachu Lal Gupta on 29 January, 1957	Case Title
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 158 of 1953. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and decree dated April 6, 1950, of the Calcutta High Court in appeal from original decree No. 166 of 1944 arising out of the decree dated June 30, 1943, of the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Asansol, in Title Suit No. 2 of 1942.
1957. January 29. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by S. K. DAS J.-This is an appeal by special leave from the judgment and decree of the High Court of Calcutta, dated April 6, 1950, by which the said High Court affirmed the judgment and decree of the Subordinate Judge of Asansol dated June 30, 1943, in Title Suit No. 2 of 1942. The suit was instituted by the four sons of one Ram Kishori Lal Sao, a resident of Asansol in Bengal, who died in September 1927. One of the plaintiffs, Kalicharan, died during the pendency of the suit and his heirs were brought on the record as plaintiffs in his stead. The defendants were Sumitra Devi, widow of the late Ram Kishori Lal, (defendant No. 1) and Kamala Devi, daughter of the late Ram Kishori Lal (defendant
-relation inter se, between the parties:	Issue
-No. 2). The said defendants, I and 2, are the appellants before us.
The suit was instituted for a declaration that a deed of gift dated March 10, 1940, executed by Sumitra Devi in favour of her daughter Kamala Devi, was void and inoperative beyond the lifetime of Sumitra Devi and was not binding on the reversion. The following genealogical table shows the
By reason of the death of Lachmi Narain before the final decree, Sumitra Devi got one-third share of the estate, one- sixth in her capacity as widow and one-sixth as the mother of her pre-deceased son. The allotment in favour of Sumitra Devi consisted mostly of house properties, and the four houses of her share with which we are concerned in this litigation were described in a schedule to the plaint and stood on Municipal Holding Nos. 116, 17, 26 and 27 of Circle 4 of the Asansol Municipality. The value of these four houses was found by the Commissioner at the time of partition to be in the neighbourhood of Rs. 19,000 only.
The marriage of Kamala Devi was settled with one Bijoy Kumar Sao, son of Nand Lal Sao, a retired Deputy Postmaster, Patna General Post Office. The case of the appellants was that the marriage was settled at Deoghar on Shivratri day in 1938 and the plaintiffs, respondents before us, had no concern with the negotiation ; it was alleged that the terms of the marriage settlement included a promise by Sumitra Devi of a gift of four houses at Asansol, worth about Rs. 20,000 as marriage dowry for Kamala. The further case of the appellants was that at the time of the marriage itself, which was performed on May 10, 1938, Sumitra Devi made a "sankalpa" of the gift of four houses at Asansol, which was accepted by Nand Lal Sao on behalf of Kamala, and the gift was later confirmed on the occasion of the Dwiragaman (Gowna) ceremony which took place in December, 1938, and possession of the houses was also given to her; soon after the marriage, however, Sumitra Devi feel ill and the deed of gift was actually executed and registered on March 10, 1940, some two years after the marriage. This was the deed of gift which was impugned by the plaintiffs-respondents. The case of the plaintiffs-respondents was that the marriage negotiations took place at Asansol and did not contain any promise of the gift of four houses as marriage dowry. The plaintiffs-respondents alleged that the arrangements were that ornaments worth about Rs. 5,000 were to be given to Kamala Devi, a sum of Rs. 800 was to be paid as travelling expenses of the bridegroom's party, and gifts of some moveable properties were to be made out of the balance of the sum of Rs. 10,000 which was set apart for the marriage expenses of Kamala Devi. The plaintiffs-respondents denied that there was any ante-nuptial promise of a gift of four houses as marriage dowry or that there was any "sankalpa" at the time of marriage or any confirmation of the gift at the Dwiragaman ceremony. They alleged that Sumitra Devi, under the evil advice of her father and son-in-law -and to deprive the plaintiffs-respondents of their right, made a gift of the four houses at Asansol in favour of Kamala Devi on the 10th March, 1940, a gift which she was not competent under the law to make. It was alleged that the gift was collusive, fraudulent and without consideration; and in any event, it could not be operative beyond the lifetime of Sumitra Devi and was not binding on the reversion, as she had only a life interest in the corpus of the property and there was no justifying legal necessity for the alienation made by her. It wag also alleged that Sumitra Devi was not legally competent to make a gift, as marriage dowry of her daughter, of such a big and unreasonable portion of the estate left by her husband.
On the aforesaid pleadings of the parties, the principal issues were Issues Nos. 2 and 3 which were in these terms:	Facts

It is necessary to state now the contentions which have been urged before us on behalf of the appellants, and they may be put in two main categories-(a) contentions with regard to the findings of fact, and (b) contentions of law. Learned counsel for the appellants has impeached the concurrent finding of the Courts below that there was no " sankalpa "
This brings us to a consideration of the principal point argued before us on behalf of the appellants, namely, whether Sumitra Devi was competent to make a gift of a reasonable portion of the estate of her husband to her daughter Kamala, Devi as a marriage dowry in pursuance and fulfilment of an ante-nuptial agreement, even though the gift was made some two years after the marriage ceremony. This point was urged before us, as we have already stated, prior to and irrespective of the enactment of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. The argument of learned counsel for the appellants was that Sumitra Devi was competent to make such a gift under the Hindu law, even as it stood prior to the enactment of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. We shall, therefore, deal with this point, irrespective of the provisions of s. 14 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. It may be stated at the very outset that the concurrent finding of the Courts below was that the gift of four houses at Asansol, of a value of about Rs. 19,000, was not disproportionate or unreasonable if one had regard to the large extent of properties left by 'Rain Kishori Lal Sao on his death; this was so even taking into consideration the sum of Rs. 10,000 which was set apart for the marriage expenses of Kamala Devi and which was withdrawn by Sumitra Devi. In our opinion, that finding is correct and must be accepted as such. Therefore, the narrow question is if Sumitra Devi,was competent to make the gift of four houses at (1) (1912) L.R. 39 I.A. 121.
We now turn to the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, which came into force on June 17, 1956. Section 14, on which learned counsel for the appellants has relied, is in these terms:	PetArg
It is necessary now to summarise the findings of the Courts below on these issues. On the questions of fact involved in the two issues, the learned Subordinate Judge came to the following findings : (1) the marriage of Kamala Devi was settled at Deoghar as claimed by Mst. Sumitra Devi and not At Asansol; (2) there was, however, no promise of any gift by her of four houses at Asansol either at the time of the settlement of the marriage terms at Deoghar or during the marriage ceremony; (3) the story of the delivery of possession of the houses to Kamala Devi was not supported by reliable evidence. Basing his decision on the aforesaid findings of fact, the learned Subordinate Judge' held that the interest created in favour of Sumitra Devi in respect of the properties allotted to her on partition was in the nature of an ordinary maintenance grant and she had no right to alienate the same in favour of her daughter. Even if she had the limited right of disposal, as in the case of a Hindu widow, she was not competent to execute any deed of gift, except with regard to a reasonable portion of the estate of her husband at the time of the marriage of Kamala Devi or on the occasion of the Gowna ceremony. Though the learned Subordinate Judge found that the properties given to Kamala Devi constituted a reasonable portion of the estate, he held that the gift not having been made at the time of the marriage or on the occasion of the Gowna ceremony in accordance with the provi- sions of s. 123, Transfer of Property Act, was not binding on the plaintiffs-respondents and could not operate beyond the lifetime of Sumitra Devi. He accordingly decreed the suit.
cash to the share of plaintiff No. 2 (Sumitra Devi) as possible on partition and as a rule should allot such properties to her share of which she may receive income without trouble, but may not prejudice the reversioners by destroying the corpus ". It follows, therefore, that under the Mitakshara law and also under the partition decree, Mst. Sumitra Devi did not have an absolute right or interest in the share allotted to her on partition. Under the decision in Debi Mangal Prasad Singh v. Mahadeo Prasad Singh (1), the property allotted to Mst. Sumitra Devi on partition stood on the same footing as property inherited by her from her husband. She had no absolute right of disposal of the property.
There are a number of decisions bearing on the question, to which our attention has been drawn by learned counsel for the parties, and we propose now to examine some of them. In Sardar Singh v. Kunj Behari Lal (1) it was observed: "There can be no doubt upon a review of the Hindu law, taken in conjunction with the decided cases, that the Hindu system recognises two sets of religious acts. One is in connection with the actual obsequies of the deceased, and the periodical performance of the obsequial rites prescribed in the Hindu religious law, which are considered as essential for the salvation of the soul of the deceased. The other relates to acts which although not essential or obligatory, are still pious observances which conduce to the bliss of the deceased's soul. In the later cases this distinction runs clearly through the views of the learned judges.................. With reference to the first class of acts, the powers of the Hindu female who holds the property are wider than in respect of the acts which are simply pious and if performed are meritorious so far as they conduce to the spiritual benefit of the deceased. In one case, if the income of the property, or the property itself, is not sufficient to cover the expenses, she is entitled to sell the whole of it. In the other case, she can alienate a small portion of the property for the pious or charitable purpose she may have in view." In a very early decision, Cossi Naut Bysack v. Hurroo Soondry Dossee (2), which war, heard by the Supreme Court at Calcutta in 1819 and by the Judicial Committee -in 1826 and quoted in Churaman Sahu v. Gopi Sahu (3), it was stated by Lord Gifford that a Hindu widow had " for certain purposes a clear authority to dispose of her husband's property and might do it for religious purposes, including dowry to a daughter." There are several texts which lay down that it is the imperative religious duty and a moral obligation of a father, mother or other guardian to give a girl 'in marriage (1) (1922) L. R. 49 I.A. 383, 391.
(3) (1909) I.L.R. 37 Cal. 1, 7.
before she attains puberty. Some of these texts have been quoted in Churaman Sahu's case(1) and Ram Sumran Prasad v. Gobind Das (2). According to these texts, the marriage of a girl by her father is enjoined as a religious duty in order to prevent him from being degraded and visited with sin ; there is also direct spiritual benefit conferred upon him by such a marriage. Marriage, according to the Sastras, is a religious act; a Sanskara for a man or woman. According to Manu, Chapter 11, verse 67, the sacrament of marriage is to a female what initiation with the thread is to a male. The Mitakshara also recognises marriage as a religious obligation for both male and female (Sundrabai Javji Dagdu Pardeshi v. Shivnarayana Ridkarna (3)). The texts also recognise that gifts can be made at the time of or on the occasion of the marriage or any ceremonies connected therewith, and may also be made in fulfilment of a promise made in connection with the marriage; some decisions have gone to the extent of laying down that the moral obligation continues till it is discharged or fulfilled and such fulfilment may be subsequent to the marriage: see Mitakshara, Chapter 1, section VII, Placitum 5 to 14. In Placitum 9 is quoted Manu's text: "To the maiden sisters, let their brothers give portions out of their own allotments respectively; to each the fourth part of the appropriate share; and they, who refuse to give it shall be degraded." In Placitum I 1, it if; stated: "If it be alleged, that, here also the mention of a quarter is indeterminate, and the allotment of property sufficient to defray the expenses of the nuptials is all which is meant to be expressed: the answer is no; for there is not any proof, that the allotment of a quarter of a share is indefinite in both codes; and the withholding of it is pronounced to be a sin." In Ramasami Ayyar v.Vengidusami Ayyar (4), it was observed with reference to the aforesaid passages in the Mitakshara, and also to certain passagein the Smriti Chandrika, wherein the texts of Manu Yajnavalkya and other Smriti writers dealing with the question of (1) (1909) I.L.R. 37 Cal. 1, 7, (2) [1926] I.L.R. 5 Pat. 646, 681.
(4) (1898) I.L.R. 22 Mad.113, 114.
allotment to be made by brothers to their maiden sisters at the time of partition, were commented upon, that with regard to the true meaning of those texts commentators were divided: some of them held that all that the texts mean is that funds required for the marriage of sisters should be provided out of their father's estate but other commentators, Vijnaneswara among them, laid down that inclusive of their marriage expenses sisters were entitled to a provision not exceeding a fourth of what they would have got had they been males. It was further observed therein that it was not necessary to decide which of the two views was to be taken as law. Subramania Ayyar J. then said: "Assuming that, as argued for the appellant, the view advocated by Vijnaneswara and his followers is not law, the fact that so high an authority as the author of the Mitakshara propounds a rule thus favourable to maiden daughters ought to make one hesitate to accept as sound the exceedingly limited construction which was insisted on on behalf of the appellant and which can scarcely be said to be in itself very reasonable, viz., that the texts justify a disbursement out of the estate of only the price of things required in connection with the celebration of the marriage. In my opinion, the better and sounder view is, as contended for the respondents, that the authorities should be Understood to empower a qualified owner like Thaiyyu Ammal to do all acts proper and incidental to the marriage of a female according to the general practice of the community to which she belongs." It should be noted that the observations aforesaid were made in a case where a widow gave her daughter in marriage and at the time of the marriage made a gift of a portion of the lands inherited by her from her husband to' her son-in-law, and the question was if the widow Thaiyyu Ammal, who was a Hindu qualified owner, had authority to make such a gift.
In Kudutamma v. Narasimha Charyulu (1), the brother, as managing member of the joint family, made a gift of a reasonable portion of the joint family Properties to his sisters. The sisters were married in (1) (1907) 17 M.L.J. 528, 531, 532.
the father's lifetime but were left for some reason or other without a marriage portion. The gift was made after the father's death and subsequent to the marriage. It was held that the brother had authority to make the gift. Miller J. observed: "If then a brother, finding that his sister, though married in his father's lifetime, has been for any reason left without a marriage portion which she ought to have received, it is difficult to see how he can be held to have exceeded his powers if he makes good the deficiency out of the family property. We are not required to hold that he is bound to do so; we are not required to hold that his father was bound in law to give his daughter anything at her marriage; it is only necessary for us to hold that the gift is not in excess of the powers of the brother and cannot therefore be recalled by him or avoided by his son." Wallis, J. who concurred in the judgment, observed: "In such a case there was, I think, a strong moral obligation on the joint family over the father as managing member to make a gift out of the joint family property on the occasion of the marriages either to the girls themselves or to their husbands as a provision for them, and the fact that the father maintained both the daughters and their husbands out of the joint family property until his death may be regarded as a continuing recognition of such moral obligation. Mere neglect on the part of the joint family to fulfil a moral obligation at the time of the marriages cannot, in my opinion, be regarded as putting an end to it, and I think it continued until it was discharged by the deed of gift now sued on and executed after the father's death by his son, the 1st defendant, who succeeded him as managing member of the joint family."
In Churaman Sahu's case (1), the gift was no doubt made on the occasion of the daughter's gowna ceremony which took place some two years after, the marriage, and it was held that the gowns ceremony was a ceremony of importance, closely connected with the marriage, though it was not a ceremony necessary to complete the marriage. The gift was upheld on that footing. What is worthy of note, however, is (1) [1909] I.L.R. 37 Cal. I. 7.
that in Churaman Sahu's case(1), the decision in Kudutamma v. Narasimha Charyulu (2) was approved, and that was a decision in which the gift was made subsequent to the marriage and not on the occasion of any particular ceremony. Sundararamayya v. Sitamma (3) is another decision of some importance. There the marriage took place about forty years before the gift and there was no evidence that the father had any intention to give any property at the time of the marriage. The question was if in those circumstances the gift was valid. After referring to the decision in Churaman Sahu v. Gopi Sahu (1) and Ramasami Ayyar v. Vengidusami Ayyar (4), it was observed: "We see no reason to differ from these two decisions. The father or the widow is not bound to giver any property. There may be no legal but only a moral obligation. It is also true that in the case before us the father did not make any gift and discharge that moral obligation at the time of marriage. But it is difficult to see why the moral obligation does not sustain a gift because it was not made to the daughter at the time of marriage but only some time later. The moral obligation of the plaintiff's father continued in force till it was discharged by the gift in 1899." The learned Judges referred with approval to the earlier decision in Kudutamma v. Narasimha Charyulu (2). The decision in Bhagwati Shukul v. Ram Jatan Tewari(5) is somewhat out of' the ordinary in the sense that a widow transferred the ,entire property inherited by her from her husband to a blind and crippled daughter in order to get her married and supply her with a handsome dowry. It was observed that no hard and fast rule could be laid down to define the extent and limit of the widow's power of disposing of the property inherited by her for the marriage of her daughter. The decision of the same case when it went up in Letters Patent appeal is reported as Bhagwati Shukul v. Ram Jatan Tewari (6). The decision of the single judge was upheld on the (1) (1909) I.L.R. 37 Cal. 1. 7. (4) (1898) I.L.R. 22 Mad. 113, 113.

The property was very small in value, being in the neighbourhood of Rs. 500 only, and where under the circumstances the marriage of the girl into a suitable Brahmin family, having regard to her blindness and infirmity, necessitated the spending of the equivalent in value of that property, then the alienation was a " sheer legal necessity." It should be observed here that this decision is on its peculiar facts, and other decisions do not support the view that an alienation of the entire property is permissible; most of the decisions lay down that an alienation of a reasonable portion of the property is only permissible. What is reasonable must depend on the facts and circumstances of each case.
In Vettor Ammal v. Pooch Ammal (1), the gift was made some years after the marriage. The gift was upheld and was held to be reasonable being about one-sixth of the whole property. In Sailabala v. Baikuntha Nath (2), a gift made by a widow of twelve annas share of her husband's estate on the occasion of the marriage of her daughter was supported on the ground that it was impossible to define the extent and limit of the widow's power of disposing of property inherited by her because it must depend upon the circumstances of the disposition whenever such disposition was made. In Ram Sumran Prasad v. Gobind Das (3), the gift was made on the 28th July, 1901, but the marriage took place in 1899, two years earlier. The gift was made in pursuance of an earlier promise and a verbal declaration made at the time of the Gantha Pakrai (catching hold of the skirt of the mother-in-law) performed during the marriage. On an exhaustive review of the decisions, the case law was summarised -as follows: 'The case law on the subject summarised above fully indicates the inclination of all the High Courts to uphold a gift by a widow of landed property to her daughter or son-in-law (1) (1911) 22 M.L.J. 321.
The learned Judges of the High Court referred to s. 123 of the Transfer of Property Act which lays down that for the purpose of making a gift of immoveable property, the transfer must be effected by a registered instrument signed by or on behalf of the donor, and attested by at least two witnesses. In one part of their judgment,, they said that but for the aforesaid provisions it might have been possible to consider the gift as having been made on the occasion of the marriage, the implementation of which was subsequent. In our opinion the learned Judges of the High Court were in error with regard to the scope and effect of s. 123 of the Transfer of Property Act. It is true that a -gift becomes legally effective only when a registered instrument is executed in the manner laid down in that section. Section 123 does not deal with nor does it affect the power of a Hindu widow to make an alienation of a reasonable portion of her husband's estate in favour of the daughter as marriage dowry. That right is governed by Hindu law and it is open to a widow to make an effective gift in favour of her daughter subsequent to the marriage, if the conditions laid down ,by Hindu law are fulfilled.
Explanation.-In this sub-section, I property' includes both moveable and immoveable property acquired by a female Hindu by inheritance or devise, or at a partition, or in lieu of maintenance or arrears of maintenance, or by gift from any person, whether a relative or not, before, at or after her marriage, or by her own skill or exertion, or by purchase or by prescription, or in any other manner whatsoever, and also any such property held by her as stridhana immediately before the commencement of this Act.

on the occasion of the marriage or any ceremonies connected with the marriage and that the promise made may be fulfilled afterwards; and it is not essential to make a gift at the time of the marriage but that it may be made afterwards, upon the ground that the gift when made fulfils the moral and religious obligation of giving a portion of the property for the benefit of the daughter and the son-in-law. The only limitation placed upon this power of making a gift is that it should bear a reasonable proportion to the entire property of the deceased father and that it should be justifiable in the circumstances of the case in terms of the principle laid down in Cossi Naut Bysack v. Hurroosoondry Dossee (1) ". In Sithamahalakshmamma v. kotayya (2), Mr. Justice Venkataramana Rao summarised the case law in the following words: " Thus it will be seen that it is competent to a Hindu father to make a gift of a reasonable portion of the ancestral imoveable property to his daughters without reference to the son; It is a power vested in the father under the Hindu law, which he can exercise subject to the restriction of limitations imposed on him by the said law. The decided cases have held that the gift must be a reasonable one. The question whether a particular gift is reasonable or not will have to be judged according to the state of the family at the time of the gift, the extent of the family immoveable property, the indebtedness of the family, and the paramount charges which the family was under
tinder the Hindu law. It was not necessary for the support of the daughter, it was not for any religious or pious work, nor was it a pressing necessity. Daughters must be maintained until their marriage, and the expenses of their marriage must be paid. But in this case the gift was not made at the time of the marriage. It was not executed until two years after the marriage." There is no consideration, nor any discussion, of the texts bearing on the question, and the learned Judge did not consider the alienation from the point of view that the marriage of the daughter was a religious duty and the promise to make a gift to the daughter as her marriage portion created a moral or religious obligation in fulfilment of which it was competent for the father to execute a deed of gift in favour of the daughter of a reasonable portion of the estate. On an examination of the decisions referred to above, the following principles clearly emerge: (1) It is the imperative, religious duty and a moral obligation of a father, mother or other guardian to give a girl in marriage to a suitable husband; it is a duty which must be fulfilled to prevent degradation, and direct spiritual benefit is conferred upon the father by such a marriage. (2) A Hindu widow in, possession of the estate of her deceased husband can make an alienation for religious acts which are not essential or obligatory but are still pious observances which conduce to the bliss of the deceased husband's soul. (3) In the case of essential or obligatory acts, if the income of the property or the property itself is not sufficient to cover the expenses, she is entitled to sell the whole of it; but for acts which are pious and which conduce to the bliss of the deceased husband's soul, she can alienate a reasonable portion of the property. (4) Gifts 'by a widow of landed property to her daughter or son-in-law on the occasion of the marriage or any ceremonies connected with the marriage, are well recognised in Hindu law. (5) If a promise is made of such a gift for or at the time of the marriage, that promise may be fulfilled afterwards and it is not essential to make a gift at the time of the marriage but it, may be made afterwards in fulfilment of the promise. (6) Some decisions go to the length of holding that there is a moral or religious obligation of giving a portion of the joint family property for the benefit of the daughter and the son-in-law, and a gift made long after the marriage may be supported upon the ground that the gift when made fulfils that moral or religious obligation.
(2) Nothing contained in sub-section (1) shall apply to any property acquired by way of gift or under a will or any other instrument or under a decree or order of a civil court or under an award where the terms of the gift, will or other instrument or the decree, order or award prescribe a restricted estate in such property- "	Section

1957. January 29. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by S. K. DAS J.-This is an appeal by special leave from the judgment and decree of the High Court of Calcutta, dated April 6, 1950, by which the said High Court affirmed the judgment and decree of the Subordinate Judge of Asansol dated June 30, 1943, in Title Suit No. 2 of 1942. The suit was instituted by the four sons of one Ram Kishori Lal Sao, a resident of Asansol in Bengal, who died in September 1927. One of the plaintiffs, Kalicharan, died during the pendency of the suit and his heirs were brought on the record as plaintiffs in his stead. The defendants were Sumitra Devi, widow of the late Ram Kishori Lal, (defendant No. 1) and Kamala Devi, daughter of the late Ram Kishori Lal (defendant
-No. 2). The said defendants, I and 2, are the appellants before us.
The suit was instituted for a declaration that a deed of gift dated March 10, 1940, executed by Sumitra Devi in favour of her daughter Kamala Devi, was void and inoperative beyond the lifetime of Sumitra Devi and was not binding on the reversion. The following genealogical table shows the
-relation inter se, between the parties:
By reason of the death of Lachmi Narain before the final decree, Sumitra Devi got one-third share of the estate, one- sixth in her capacity as widow and one-sixth as the mother of her pre-deceased son. The allotment in favour of Sumitra Devi consisted mostly of house properties, and the four houses of her share with which we are concerned in this litigation were described in a schedule to the plaint and stood on Municipal Holding Nos. 116, 17, 26 and 27 of Circle 4 of the Asansol Municipality. The value of these four houses was found by the Commissioner at the time of partition to be in the neighbourhood of Rs. 19,000 only.
The marriage of Kamala Devi was settled with one Bijoy Kumar Sao, son of Nand Lal Sao, a retired Deputy Postmaster, Patna General Post Office. The case of the appellants was that the marriage was settled at Deoghar on Shivratri day in 1938 and the plaintiffs, respondents before us, had no concern with the negotiation ; it was alleged that the terms of the marriage settlement included a promise by Sumitra Devi of a gift of four houses at Asansol, worth about Rs. 20,000 as marriage dowry for Kamala. The further case of the appellants was that at the time of the marriage itself, which was performed on May 10, 1938, Sumitra Devi made a "sankalpa" of the gift of four houses at Asansol, which was accepted by Nand Lal Sao on behalf of Kamala, and the gift was later confirmed on the occasion of the Dwiragaman (Gowna) ceremony which took place in December, 1938, and possession of the houses was also given to her; soon after the marriage, however, Sumitra Devi feel ill and the deed of gift was actually executed and registered on March 10, 1940, some two years after the marriage. This was the deed of gift which was impugned by the plaintiffs-respondents. The case of the plaintiffs-respondents was that the marriage negotiations took place at Asansol and did not contain any promise of the gift of four houses as marriage dowry. The plaintiffs-respondents alleged that the arrangements were that ornaments worth about Rs. 5,000 were to be given to Kamala Devi, a sum of Rs. 800 was to be paid as travelling expenses of the bridegroom's party, and gifts of some moveable properties were to be made out of the balance of the sum of Rs. 10,000 which was set apart for the marriage expenses of Kamala Devi. The plaintiffs-respondents denied that there was any ante-nuptial promise of a gift of four houses as marriage dowry or that there was any "sankalpa" at the time of marriage or any confirmation of the gift at the Dwiragaman ceremony. They alleged that Sumitra Devi, under the evil advice of her father and son-in-law -and to deprive the plaintiffs-respondents of their right, made a gift of the four houses at Asansol in favour of Kamala Devi on the 10th March, 1940, a gift which she was not competent under the law to make. It was alleged that the gift was collusive, fraudulent and without consideration; and in any event, it could not be operative beyond the lifetime of Sumitra Devi and was not binding on the reversion, as she had only a life interest in the corpus of the property and there was no justifying legal necessity for the alienation made by her. It wag also alleged that Sumitra Devi was not legally competent to make a gift, as marriage dowry of her daughter, of such a big and unreasonable portion of the estate left by her husband.
On the aforesaid pleadings of the parties, the principal issues were Issues Nos. 2 and 3 which were in these terms:
It is necessary now to summarise the findings of the Courts below on these issues. On the questions of fact involved in the two issues, the learned Subordinate Judge came to the following findings : (1) the marriage of Kamala Devi was settled at Deoghar as claimed by Mst. Sumitra Devi and not At Asansol; (2) there was, however, no promise of any gift by her of four houses at Asansol either at the time of the settlement of the marriage terms at Deoghar or during the marriage ceremony; (3) the story of the delivery of possession of the houses to Kamala Devi was not supported by reliable evidence. Basing his decision on the aforesaid findings of fact, the learned Subordinate Judge' held that the interest created in favour of Sumitra Devi in respect of the properties allotted to her on partition was in the nature of an ordinary maintenance grant and she had no right to alienate the same in favour of her daughter. Even if she had the limited right of disposal, as in the case of a Hindu widow, she was not competent to execute any deed of gift, except with regard to a reasonable portion of the estate of her husband at the time of the marriage of Kamala Devi or on the occasion of the Gowna ceremony. Though the learned Subordinate Judge found that the properties given to Kamala Devi constituted a reasonable portion of the estate, he held that the gift not having been made at the time of the marriage or on the occasion of the Gowna ceremony in accordance with the provi- sions of s. 123, Transfer of Property Act, was not binding on the plaintiffs-respondents and could not operate beyond the lifetime of Sumitra Devi. He accordingly decreed the suit.
The learned Judges of the High Court formulated five questions of fact, four of which are important for our purpose, and on a fresh consideration of the evidence on the record, came to the following findings thereon: (1) a final settlement of the terms of marriage was made at Deoghar and the terms which were settled between the parties were: (a) that Sumitra Devi would arrange for the gift of ornaments worth about Rs. 5,000, (b) a sum of Rs. 800 would be paid for meeting the expenses of travelling of the bridegroom's party from Patna to Asansol, (e) a sum of Rs. 51 would be paid for the Tilak ceremony and (d) a gift of four houses at Asansol, worth about Rs. 20,000, would be made in favour of Kamala Devi, though the evidence led on behalf of the appellants did not make it absolutely clear or specific that the promise related to the four particular houses which were the subjectmatter of the subsequent gift; (2) the plaintiffs-respondents had nothing to do either with the settlement of the terms of marriage or with any control or management of the marriage ceremony; (3) there was no reliable evidence that Sumitra Devi had made a " sankalpa "
was of a reasonable portion of her husband's properties, the learned Judges observed: " In the present case, the value of the houses gifted was just above Rs. 18,000 which was about a fourth of the value of each share allotted (viz., above Rs. 73,000). Even if the provision of Rs. 10,000 made in the partition decree for meeting the marriage expenses be taken into account, we cannot say that the value of the gifted houses was disproportionate or unreasonable." In the result, the High Court affirmed the decision of the learned Subordinate Judge and dismissed the appeal preferred by the defendants who are the appellants here.
It is necessary to state now the contentions which have been urged before us on behalf of the appellants, and they may be put in two main categories-(a) contentions with regard to the findings of fact, and (b) contentions of law. Learned counsel for the appellants has impeached the concurrent finding of the Courts below that there was no " sankalpa "
cash to the share of plaintiff No. 2 (Sumitra Devi) as possible on partition and as a rule should allot such properties to her share of which she may receive income without trouble, but may not prejudice the reversioners by destroying the corpus ". It follows, therefore, that under the Mitakshara law and also under the partition decree, Mst. Sumitra Devi did not have an absolute right or interest in the share allotted to her on partition. Under the decision in Debi Mangal Prasad Singh v. Mahadeo Prasad Singh (1), the property allotted to Mst. Sumitra Devi on partition stood on the same footing as property inherited by her from her husband. She had no absolute right of disposal of the property.
This brings us to a consideration of the principal point argued before us on behalf of the appellants, namely, whether Sumitra Devi was competent to make a gift of a reasonable portion of the estate of her husband to her daughter Kamala, Devi as a marriage dowry in pursuance and fulfilment of an ante-nuptial agreement, even though the gift was made some two years after the marriage ceremony. This point was urged before us, as we have already stated, prior to and irrespective of the enactment of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. The argument of learned counsel for the appellants was that Sumitra Devi was competent to make such a gift under the Hindu law, even as it stood prior to the enactment of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. We shall, therefore, deal with this point, irrespective of the provisions of s. 14 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. It may be stated at the very outset that the concurrent finding of the Courts below was that the gift of four houses at Asansol, of a value of about Rs. 19,000, was not disproportionate or unreasonable if one had regard to the large extent of properties left by 'Rain Kishori Lal Sao on his death; this was so even taking into consideration the sum of Rs. 10,000 which was set apart for the marriage expenses of Kamala Devi and which was withdrawn by Sumitra Devi. In our opinion, that finding is correct and must be accepted as such. Therefore, the narrow question is if Sumitra Devi,was competent to make the gift of four houses at (1) (1912) L.R. 39 I.A. 121.
Asansol as marriage dowry to her daughter, some two years after the marriage, in pursuance and fulfilment of the ante- nuptial agreement made at Deoghar.
There are a number of decisions bearing on the question, to which our attention has been drawn by learned counsel for the parties, and we propose now to examine some of them. In Sardar Singh v. Kunj Behari Lal (1) it was observed: "There can be no doubt upon a review of the Hindu law, taken in conjunction with the decided cases, that the Hindu system recognises two sets of religious acts. One is in connection with the actual obsequies of the deceased, and the periodical performance of the obsequial rites prescribed in the Hindu religious law, which are considered as essential for the salvation of the soul of the deceased. The other relates to acts which although not essential or obligatory, are still pious observances which conduce to the bliss of the deceased's soul. In the later cases this distinction runs clearly through the views of the learned judges.................. With reference to the first class of acts, the powers of the Hindu female who holds the property are wider than in respect of the acts which are simply pious and if performed are meritorious so far as they conduce to the spiritual benefit of the deceased. In one case, if the income of the property, or the property itself, is not sufficient to cover the expenses, she is entitled to sell the whole of it. In the other case, she can alienate a small portion of the property for the pious or charitable purpose she may have in view." In a very early decision, Cossi Naut Bysack v. Hurroo Soondry Dossee (2), which war, heard by the Supreme Court at Calcutta in 1819 and by the Judicial Committee -in 1826 and quoted in Churaman Sahu v. Gopi Sahu (3), it was stated by Lord Gifford that a Hindu widow had " for certain purposes a clear authority to dispose of her husband's property and might do it for religious purposes, including dowry to a daughter." There are several texts which lay down that it is the imperative religious duty and a moral obligation of a father, mother or other guardian to give a girl 'in marriage (1) (1922) L. R. 49 I.A. 383, 391.
(2) 2 Morley's Digest 198.
(3) (1909) I.L.R. 37 Cal. 1, 7.
before she attains puberty. Some of these texts have been quoted in Churaman Sahu's case(1) and Ram Sumran Prasad v. Gobind Das (2). According to these texts, the marriage of a girl by her father is enjoined as a religious duty in order to prevent him from being degraded and visited with sin ; there is also direct spiritual benefit conferred upon him by such a marriage. Marriage, according to the Sastras, is a religious act; a Sanskara for a man or woman. According to Manu, Chapter 11, verse 67, the sacrament of marriage is to a female what initiation with the thread is to a male. The Mitakshara also recognises marriage as a religious obligation for both male and female (Sundrabai Javji Dagdu Pardeshi v. Shivnarayana Ridkarna (3)). The texts also recognise that gifts can be made at the time of or on the occasion of the marriage or any ceremonies connected therewith, and may also be made in fulfilment of a promise made in connection with the marriage; some decisions have gone to the extent of laying down that the moral obligation continues till it is discharged or fulfilled and such fulfilment may be subsequent to the marriage: see Mitakshara, Chapter 1, section VII, Placitum 5 to 14. In Placitum 9 is quoted Manu's text: "To the maiden sisters, let their brothers give portions out of their own allotments respectively; to each the fourth part of the appropriate share; and they, who refuse to give it shall be degraded." In Placitum I 1, it if; stated: "If it be alleged, that, here also the mention of a quarter is indeterminate, and the allotment of property sufficient to defray the expenses of the nuptials is all which is meant to be expressed: the answer is no; for there is not any proof, that the allotment of a quarter of a share is indefinite in both codes; and the withholding of it is pronounced to be a sin." In Ramasami Ayyar v.Vengidusami Ayyar (4), it was observed with reference to the aforesaid passages in the Mitakshara, and also to certain passagein the Smriti Chandrika, wherein the texts of Manu Yajnavalkya and other Smriti writers dealing with the question of (1) (1909) I.L.R. 37 Cal. 1, 7, (2) [1926] I.L.R. 5 Pat. 646, 681.
(3) [1907] I.L.R. 32 Bom. 81.
(4) (1898) I.L.R. 22 Mad.113, 114.
allotment to be made by brothers to their maiden sisters at the time of partition, were commented upon, that with regard to the true meaning of those texts commentators were divided: some of them held that all that the texts mean is that funds required for the marriage of sisters should be provided out of their father's estate but other commentators, Vijnaneswara among them, laid down that inclusive of their marriage expenses sisters were entitled to a provision not exceeding a fourth of what they would have got had they been males. It was further observed therein that it was not necessary to decide which of the two views was to be taken as law. Subramania Ayyar J. then said: "Assuming that, as argued for the appellant, the view advocated by Vijnaneswara and his followers is not law, the fact that so high an authority as the author of the Mitakshara propounds a rule thus favourable to maiden daughters ought to make one hesitate to accept as sound the exceedingly limited construction which was insisted on on behalf of the appellant and which can scarcely be said to be in itself very reasonable, viz., that the texts justify a disbursement out of the estate of only the price of things required in connection with the celebration of the marriage. In my opinion, the better and sounder view is, as contended for the respondents, that the authorities should be Understood to empower a qualified owner like Thaiyyu Ammal to do all acts proper and incidental to the marriage of a female according to the general practice of the community to which she belongs." It should be noted that the observations aforesaid were made in a case where a widow gave her daughter in marriage and at the time of the marriage made a gift of a portion of the lands inherited by her from her husband to' her son-in-law, and the question was if the widow Thaiyyu Ammal, who was a Hindu qualified owner, had authority to make such a gift.
In Kudutamma v. Narasimha Charyulu (1), the brother, as managing member of the joint family, made a gift of a reasonable portion of the joint family Properties to his sisters. The sisters were married in (1) (1907) 17 M.L.J. 528, 531, 532.
the father's lifetime but were left for some reason or other without a marriage portion. The gift was made after the father's death and subsequent to the marriage. It was held that the brother had authority to make the gift. Miller J. observed: "If then a brother, finding that his sister, though married in his father's lifetime, has been for any reason left without a marriage portion which she ought to have received, it is difficult to see how he can be held to have exceeded his powers if he makes good the deficiency out of the family property. We are not required to hold that he is bound to do so; we are not required to hold that his father was bound in law to give his daughter anything at her marriage; it is only necessary for us to hold that the gift is not in excess of the powers of the brother and cannot therefore be recalled by him or avoided by his son." Wallis, J. who concurred in the judgment, observed: "In such a case there was, I think, a strong moral obligation on the joint family over the father as managing member to make a gift out of the joint family property on the occasion of the marriages either to the girls themselves or to their husbands as a provision for them, and the fact that the father maintained both the daughters and their husbands out of the joint family property until his death may be regarded as a continuing recognition of such moral obligation. Mere neglect on the part of the joint family to fulfil a moral obligation at the time of the marriages cannot, in my opinion, be regarded as putting an end to it, and I think it continued until it was discharged by the deed of gift now sued on and executed after the father's death by his son, the 1st defendant, who succeeded him as managing member of the joint family."
In Churaman Sahu's case (1), the gift was no doubt made on the occasion of the daughter's gowna ceremony which took place some two years after, the marriage, and it was held that the gowns ceremony was a ceremony of importance, closely connected with the marriage, though it was not a ceremony necessary to complete the marriage. The gift was upheld on that footing. What is worthy of note, however, is (1) [1909] I.L.R. 37 Cal. I. 7.
that in Churaman Sahu's case(1), the decision in Kudutamma v. Narasimha Charyulu (2) was approved, and that was a decision in which the gift was made subsequent to the marriage and not on the occasion of any particular ceremony. Sundararamayya v. Sitamma (3) is another decision of some importance. There the marriage took place about forty years before the gift and there was no evidence that the father had any intention to give any property at the time of the marriage. The question was if in those circumstances the gift was valid. After referring to the decision in Churaman Sahu v. Gopi Sahu (1) and Ramasami Ayyar v. Vengidusami Ayyar (4), it was observed: "We see no reason to differ from these two decisions. The father or the widow is not bound to giver any property. There may be no legal but only a moral obligation. It is also true that in the case before us the father did not make any gift and discharge that moral obligation at the time of marriage. But it is difficult to see why the moral obligation does not sustain a gift because it was not made to the daughter at the time of marriage but only some time later. The moral obligation of the plaintiff's father continued in force till it was discharged by the gift in 1899." The learned Judges referred with approval to the earlier decision in Kudutamma v. Narasimha Charyulu (2). The decision in Bhagwati Shukul v. Ram Jatan Tewari(5) is somewhat out of' the ordinary in the sense that a widow transferred the ,entire property inherited by her from her husband to a blind and crippled daughter in order to get her married and supply her with a handsome dowry. It was observed that no hard and fast rule could be laid down to define the extent and limit of the widow's power of disposing of the property inherited by her for the marriage of her daughter. The decision of the same case when it went up in Letters Patent appeal is reported as Bhagwati Shukul v. Ram Jatan Tewari (6). The decision of the single judge was upheld on the (1) (1909) I.L.R. 37 Cal. 1. 7. (4) (1898) I.L.R. 22 Mad. 113, 113.

297. ground that in order to get the girl married, it was " a sheer necessity " for the widow, to provide a dowry of Rs. 500 or its equivalent by the gift of the property. The property was very small in value, being in the neighbourhood of Rs. 500 only, and where under the circumstances the marriage of the girl into a suitable Brahmin family, having regard to her blindness and infirmity, necessitated the spending of the equivalent in value of that property, then the alienation was a " sheer legal necessity." It should be observed here that this decision is on its peculiar facts, and other decisions do not support the view that an alienation of the entire property is permissible; most of the decisions lay down that an alienation of a reasonable portion of the property is only permissible. What is reasonable must depend on the facts and circumstances of each case.
In Vettor Ammal v. Pooch Ammal (1), the gift was made some years after the marriage. The gift was upheld and was held to be reasonable being about one-sixth of the whole property. In Sailabala v. Baikuntha Nath (2), a gift made by a widow of twelve annas share of her husband's estate on the occasion of the marriage of her daughter was supported on the ground that it was impossible to define the extent and limit of the widow's power of disposing of property inherited by her because it must depend upon the circumstances of the disposition whenever such disposition was made. In Ram Sumran Prasad v. Gobind Das (3), the gift was made on the 28th July, 1901, but the marriage took place in 1899, two years earlier. The gift was made in pursuance of an earlier promise and a verbal declaration made at the time of the Gantha Pakrai (catching hold of the skirt of the mother-in-law) performed during the marriage. On an exhaustive review of the decisions, the case law was summarised -as follows: 'The case law on the subject summarised above fully indicates the inclination of all the High Courts to uphold a gift by a widow of landed property to her daughter or son-in-law (1) (1911) 22 M.L.J. 321.
(2) A.I.R. 1926 Cal. 486, (3) [1926] T.L.R. 5 Pat. 646, 681.
on the occasion of the marriage or any ceremonies connected with the marriage and that the promise made may be fulfilled afterwards; and it is not essential to make a gift at the time of the marriage but that it may be made afterwards, upon the ground that the gift when made fulfils the moral and religious obligation of giving a portion of the property for the benefit of the daughter and the son-in-law. The only limitation placed upon this power of making a gift is that it should bear a reasonable proportion to the entire property of the deceased father and that it should be justifiable in the circumstances of the case in terms of the principle laid down in Cossi Naut Bysack v. Hurroosoondry Dossee (1) ". In Sithamahalakshmamma v. kotayya (2), Mr. Justice Venkataramana Rao summarised the case law in the following words: " Thus it will be seen that it is competent to a Hindu father to make a gift of a reasonable portion of the ancestral imoveable property to his daughters without reference to the son; It is a power vested in the father under the Hindu law, which he can exercise subject to the restriction of limitations imposed on him by the said law. The decided cases have held that the gift must be a reasonable one. The question whether a particular gift is reasonable or not will have to be judged according to the state of the family at the time of the gift, the extent of the family immoveable property, the indebtedness of the family, and the paramount charges which the family was under
As against the very large number of decisions refered to above, the only decision which can be said to strike a dissentient note is the decision in ganga Bisheshar v. Pirthi Pal(3). That was a case in which one Debi Prasad executed a deed of gift of a certain share in a certain village, being the ancestral property of his family, in favour of the defendant ganga Bisheshar, the father-in-law of his daughter, on April 25, 1872, about two years after the marriage of the daughter. Mr. Justice Spankie observed as follows: "I understand the finding of both the lower Courts to be that the transfer was not made for any necessary purpose allowed by the Hindu law.The deed of gift appears to have been made by the father in performance of a a dowry to his daughter. But I am not aware that the performace of such a promise be regarded as a lawful purpose justifying alienation alienation (1) (1912) I4 Bom. L. R. 602.
(2) A.I.R. 1922 P. C. 201.
(3) (1880) I. L. R. 2 All. 635, 638.
tinder the Hindu law. It was not necessary for the support of the daughter, it was not for any religious or pious work, nor was it a pressing necessity. Daughters must be maintained until their marriage, and the expenses of their marriage must be paid. But in this case the gift was not made at the time of the marriage. It was not executed until two years after the marriage." There is no consideration, nor any discussion, of the texts bearing on the question, and the learned Judge did not consider the alienation from the point of view that the marriage of the daughter was a religious duty and the promise to make a gift to the daughter as her marriage portion created a moral or religious obligation in fulfilment of which it was competent for the father to execute a deed of gift in favour of the daughter of a reasonable portion of the estate. On an examination of the decisions referred to above, the following principles clearly emerge: (1) It is the imperative, religious duty and a moral obligation of a father, mother or other guardian to give a girl in marriage to a suitable husband; it is a duty which must be fulfilled to prevent degradation, and direct spiritual benefit is conferred upon the father by such a marriage. (2) A Hindu widow in, possession of the estate of her deceased husband can make an alienation for religious acts which are not essential or obligatory but are still pious observances which conduce to the bliss of the deceased husband's soul. (3) In the case of essential or obligatory acts, if the income of the property or the property itself is not sufficient to cover the expenses, she is entitled to sell the whole of it; but for acts which are pious and which conduce to the bliss of the deceased husband's soul, she can alienate a reasonable portion of the property. (4) Gifts 'by a widow of landed property to her daughter or son-in-law on the occasion of the marriage or any ceremonies connected with the marriage, are well recognised in Hindu law. (5) If a promise is made of such a gift for or at the time of the marriage, that promise may be fulfilled afterwards and it is not essential to make a gift at the time of the marriage but it, may be made afterwards in fulfilment of the promise. (6) Some decisions go to the length of holding that there is a moral or religious obligation of giving a portion of the joint family property for the benefit of the daughter and the son-in-law, and a gift made long after the marriage may be supported upon the ground that the gift when made fulfils that moral or religious obligation.
In the case before us, it is not even necessary to go to the extent to which the decisions covered by the last item stated above (item 6) have gone. The finding of the final Court of fact is that there was an antenuptial agreement by Sumitra Devi that she would give four houses at Asansol, of the value of Rs. 20,000, to her daughter as marriage dowry. It was open to Sumitra Devi to fulfil that promise as a religious act which conferred spiritual benefit upon her deceased husband, irrespective of the consideration whether she made a " sankalpa " at the time of the marriage or not. We have already stated that we concur in the finding -of the Courts below that the gift was neither disproportionate nor unreasonable in extent.
The learned Judges of the High Court referred to s. 123 of the Transfer of Property Act which lays down that for the purpose of making a gift of immoveable property, the transfer must be effected by a registered instrument signed by or on behalf of the donor, and attested by at least two witnesses. In one part of their judgment,, they said that but for the aforesaid provisions it might have been possible to consider the gift as having been made on the occasion of the marriage, the implementation of which was subsequent. In our opinion the learned Judges of the High Court were in error with regard to the scope and effect of s. 123 of the Transfer of Property Act. It is true that a -gift becomes legally effective only when a registered instrument is executed in the manner laid down in that section. Section 123 does not deal with nor does it affect the power of a Hindu widow to make an alienation of a reasonable portion of her husband's estate in favour of the daughter as marriage dowry. That right is governed by Hindu law and it is open to a widow to make an effective gift in favour of her daughter subsequent to the marriage, if the conditions laid down ,by Hindu law are fulfilled.
For the reasons given above, we hold that the alienation made by Mst. Sumitra Devi in favour of her daughter Kamala Devi on March 10, '1940, was valid and binding on the reversioners. The decision of the High Court to the contrary was erroneous in law.
We now turn to the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, which came into force on June 17, 1956. Section 14, on which learned counsel for the appellants has relied, is in these terms:
Explanation.-In this sub-section, I property' includes both moveable and immoveable property acquired by a female Hindu by inheritance or devise, or at a partition, or in lieu of maintenance or arrears of maintenance, or by gift from any person, whether a relative or not, before, at or after her marriage, or by her own skill or exertion, or by purchase or by prescription, or in any other manner whatsoever, and also any such property held by her as stridhana immediately before the commencement of this Act.
(2) Nothing contained in sub-section (1) shall apply to any property acquired by way of gift or under a will or any other instrument or under a decree or order of a civil court or under an award where the terms of the gift, will or other instrument or the decree, order or award prescribe a restricted estate in such property- "	Total Judgement
