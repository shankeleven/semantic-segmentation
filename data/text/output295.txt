Ram Prasad Narayan Sahi And Another vs The State Of Bihar And Others on 20 February, 1953	Case Title
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 59 of 1952.
Appeal from the Judgment and Order dated 3rd January, 1952, of the High Court of Judicature at Patna (Ramaswami and Sarjoo Prosad JJ). in an application under article 226 of the Constitution registered as Miscellaneous Judicial Case No. 204 of 1950.	Issue
In paragraph 12 of the counter-affidavit put in on behalf of the respondents, these statements are not denied. In fact, they are admitted and the only thing said is, that these leases were granted in due course of management. Ramaswami J. has dismissed this part of the case by simply remarking that no details of these settlements were furnished by the appellants; but no details were at all necessary when the correctness of the statements was not challenged by the respondents. It will be interesting to note that the respondents themselves in paragraph 10 of their counter- affidavit mentioned the name of Shri Prajapati Mishra as one of the persons with whom similar settlement of lands was made by the Bettiah Estate. It is stated in that paragraph that the cases of the appellants as well as of Prajapati Mishra were brought to the notice of the Working Committee of the Indian National Congress and the Committee came to the conclusion that both the settlements were contrary to the provisions of law. Thereupon a request was made to both these sets of lessees to restore their lands to the Estate, but whereas Prajapati Mishra returned his lands to the Bettiah Estate, the appellants refused to do so. In reply to this statement, the appellants stated in their rejoinder that the said Prajapati Mishra did not vacate the land,% but created a trust in respect of the same, he being the chairman of the board Of trustees and the lands were still in possession of the board of trustees. Strangely, as it seems, the State of Bihar raked up this matter again in a further affidavit where it was admitted that the said Prajapati Mishra did execute a trust and that the trustees took possession of the property. It was stated, however, that Prajapati Mishra, who was one of the trustees, did actually surrender the lands in two installments but the other trustees did not, and hence legal advice was being taken to find out ways and means of recovering the property from them. The whole thing smacks of disingenuousness and the State of Bihar, it seems, was not well advised in rely- ing upon facts like these in their attempt to repel the appellants' attack on the legislation on the ground of discrimination.

1953. February 20. The court delivered judgment as follows :-
The decision of the majority of this Court in Chiran v. The Union of India(1) is relied on in suport of these contentions, In that case, however, the (1) [1950] S.C.R. 869, majority felt justified in upholding the legislation, though it adversely affected the rights and interest of the shareholders of a particular joint stock company, because the mismanagement of the company's affairs prejudicially affected the production of an essential commodity and caused serious unemployment amongst a section of the community. Mr. Justice Das and I took the 'view that legislation directed against a particular named person or corporation was obviously discriminatory and could not constitutionally be justified even if such legislation resulted in some benefit to the public. In a system of government by political parties, I was apprehensive of the danger inherent in special enactments which deprive particular named persons of their liberty or property because the Legislature thinks them guilty of misconduct, and I said in my dissenting opinion:
My apprehensions have come true. Recently we had before us a case from Hyderabad (Civil Appeal ,No. 63 of 1952Ameerunnissa Begum v. Mahboob Begum)' where the duly constituted legislative authority of that State intervened in a succession dispute between two sets of rival claimants to the estate of a deceased person and " dismissed " the claim of the one and adjudged the Property to the other by making a special " law " to that effect. And now comes this case from Bihar of an essentially similar type. The appellants assert title to certain lands in Bettiah Estate under a settlement which they claim to have lawfully obtained from the Court of Wards, while it is now alleged on behalf of the Estate that the settlement was not for the benefit of the Estate and was contrary to law, as the Court of Wards did not then " apply its (1) Since reported as [1953] S.C.R 404 mind " to that question. This is purely a dispute between private parties and a matter for determination by duly constituted courts to which is entrusted, in every free and civilised society, the important function of adjudicating on disputed legal rights, after observing the well established procedural safeguards which include the right to be heard, the right to produce witnesses and so forth. This is the protection which the law guarantees equally to all persons, and our Constitution prohibits by article 14 every State from denying such protection to anyone. The appellants before us have been denied this protection. A political Organization of the party in power decides after making such enquiry as it thought fit, that the settlement in question was " contrary to the provisions of law and public policy "

The impugned Act consists of three sections. Section 2(1) declares that "notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force"', the settlement obtained by the appellants is "null and void", and that "no party to the settlement or his successor in interest shall be deemed to have acquired any right or incurred any liability thereunder". Sub-section (2) provides that the appellants and their successors in interest "shall quit possession of the said land from the date of commencement of this Act and if they fail to do so, the Collector of Champaran shall eject them and restore the lands to the possession of the Bettiah Wards Estate". Subsection (3) provides for the refund of the amount of salami money and the cost of improvement, if any, to the lessees by the estate on restoration to it of the lands in question.

The appellants before us have been denied this protection. A political Organization of the party in power decides after making such enquiry as it thought fit, that the settlement in question was " contrary to the provisions of law and public policy "
Apparently it makes the Court of Wards the sole judge of the benefit to the estate or advantage of the ward. But it is said that the Court of Wards did not apply its mind properly to this matter when it granted lease to the appellants at half the usual rate of selami. The Wards Estate thus suffered loss to the extent of nearly Rs. 4,000 which could legitimately have been recovered from any other lessee. This contention does not impress us much; the utmost that can be said is that this could have been put forward, for what it is worth and with what result, nobody can say, as a ground for setting aside the lease in a court of law. But that is not the question which is relevant for our present purpose at all; we were not called upon to decide whether or not the lease was a proper one or beneficial to the estate. The question for our decision is, whether the statute contains discriminatory provisions so far as the appellants are concerned and if so, whether these discriminations could be reasonably justified ? It is clearly stated in paragraph 9 of the affidavit made by the appellants in support of their petition that there are numerous other persons to whom leases on similar terms were granted by the Bettiah Wards Estate. Clauses (b), (c) and
(d) of paragraph 9 of the affidavit stand thus:
In paragraph 12 of the counter-affidavit put in on behalf of the respondents, these statements are not denied. In fact, they are admitted and the only thing said is, that these leases were granted in due course of management. Ramaswami J. has dismissed this part of the case by simply remarking that no details of these settlements were furnished by the appellants; but no details were at all necessary when the correctness of the statements was not challenged by the respondents.

Strangely, as it seems, the State of Bihar raked up this matter again in a further affidavit where it was admitted that the said Prajapati Mishra did execute a trust and that the trustees took possession of the property. It was stated, however, that Prajapati Mishra, who was one of the trustees, did actually surrender the lands in two installments but the other trustees did not, and hence legal advice was being taken to find out ways and means of recovering the property from them. The whole thing smacks of disingenuousness and the State of Bihar, it seems, was not well advised in rely- ing upon facts like these in their attempt to repel the appellants' attack on the legislation on the ground of discrimination.
Be that as it may, there is no doubt that the appellants were not the only lessees under the Bettiah Estate who got settlement of lands at a selami of five years' rental. On the sworn statements of the appellants, which are not challenged by the other side, it appears that there are numerous persons occupying the same position as the appellants, who however were not subjected to this expropriatory legislation. But the vice in this legislation goes much deeper than this. It is not merely a question of treating the appellants differently from the other lessees under the Wards Estate, with whom settlements of land have been made on similar or identical terms. If a lease has been given by a Court of Wards, which is not for the benefit of the estate or advantage of the ward, it is for a court of ,law to decide whether it is warranted by the terms of the Court of Wards Act. If the lessor proceeds to cancel the lease, the lessee has a legal right to defend his claim and satisfy the court that the lease is not in contravention of law. If, on the other hand, the lessee is actually dispossessed, he has a right to sue in court for recovery of possession of the property on establishing that he has been illegally turned out. The dispute here, is a legal dispute pure and simple between two private parties. What the Legislature has done is to single out these two individuals and deny them the right which every Indian citizen possesses to have his rights adju- dicated upon by a judicial tribunal in accordance with the law which applies to his case. The meanest of citizens has a right of access to a court of law for the redress of his just grievances and it is of this right that the appellants have been deprived by this Act. It is impossible to conceive of a worse form of discrimination than the one which differentiates a particular individual from all his fellow subjects and visits him with a disability which is not imposed upon anybody else and against which even the right of complaint is taken away. The learned Attorney- General, who placed his case with his usual fairness and ability, could not put forward any convincing or satisfactory reason upon which this legislation could be justified. It is true that the presumption is in favour of the constitutionality of a legislative enactment and it has to be presumed that a Legislature understands and correctly appreciates the needs of its own people. But when on the face of a statute there is no classification at all, and no attempt has been made to select any individual or group with reference to any differentiating attribute peculiar to that individual or group and not possessed by others, this presumption is of little or no assistance. to the State. We may repeat with profit what was said by Mr. Justice Brewer in Gulf Colorado etc. Co. v. Ellis(1) that "to carry the presumption to the extent of holding that there must be some undisclosed and unknown reason for subjecting certain"
comprised in the lease referred to in that Act. The appellants will have their costs in both courts.
