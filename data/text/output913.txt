Union Of India vs Chaman Lal Loona on 30 April, 1957	Case Title
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 24 of 1954. Appeal under Article 132 read with Article 147 and Article 133(1)(c) of the Constitution of India from the judgment and order dated July 17, 1952, of the Punjab High Court in First Appeal from Order No. 9 of 1949 against the judgment and decree of the Sub-Judge 1st Class, Ferozepur dated February 9, 1949, in Civil Sui No. 134 of 1949.
Porus A. Mehta, R. Gopalakrishnan and R.H. Dhebar, for the appellant.
Hardayal Hardy, for the respondents.	Issue
The relevant facts are these. In the Court of the' senior Subordinate Judge at Ferozepur, in August, 1948, the respondent Company made an application, purporting to be an application under s. 8(2) and s. 20 of the Arbitration Act, 10 of 1940, wherein the respondent alleged that in 1945 the respondent had entered into a contract for the supply of "	Facts
On behalf of the respondent, the correctness of each of the above submissions has been seriously contested, and learned counsel for the respondent has strongly contended that the view of the High Court as to the relevant articles of the Independence Order, 1947, and the Defence Order, 1947, is correct. Learned counsel also raised a preliminary point of objection to the effect that on an application under s. 20, Arbitration Act, the only point for decision was if there was an arbitration agreement and the question of liability was one for the arbitrator and not for the Court to decide. Ordinarily, that would be so. When, however, we pointed out to learned counsel that the Union of India as such was admittedly not a party to the arbitration agreement and could not be dragged, therefore, to an arbitration proceeding on the strength of an agreement to which it was not a party unless by operation of law it was deemed to be a party to the agreement, learned counsel gave up his preliminary objection and conceded that the question of liability must be decided in this case with reference to the provisions of the Independence Order, 1947, and the Defence Order, 1947.	RespArg
1957. April 30. The Judgment of the Court was, delivered by S. K. DAS J.-This is an appeal on the strength of a certificate granted by the High Court of Punjab at Simla. The appellant is the Union-of India and the respondent Messrs. Chaman Lal Loona and Company military contractors at Muktsar in the district of Ferozepur, now in the Indian State of Punjab.

exclusively for the purposes of the Dominion of Pakistan as from the appointed day.	Precedent
The principal question in this appeal is whether the High Court is right in its view as to the true scope and effect of the relevant provisions of the Independence Order, 1947, and the Defence Order, 1947. Learned counsel for the appellant has challenged the correctness of that view, and has submitted-(1) that on a true construction of Art. 8 of the Independence Order, 1947, the contract under consideration in this case was as from the appointed day (i.e., August 15, 1947), a contract exclusively for the purposes of the Dominion of Pakistan and shall be deemed to have been made on behalf of that Dominion, and all rights and liabilities which have accrued or may accrue under such contract shall be the rights and liabilities of the Dominion of Pakistan; (2) that the Defence Order, 1947, which set up a Joint Defence Council and provides for the exercise of certain powers of control by the said Council under Art. 8 of that Order did not in any way affect the rights and liabilities arising out of the contract, which rights and liabilities were governed by the relevant provisions of the Independence Order, 1947; and (3) that, in any view, the claim in the present case did not relate to military stores as the High Court wrongly assumed, and the Defence Order, 1947, had no application at all to the facts of this case.
It is convenient at this stage to set out the relevant provisions of the two Orders. The Defence Order, 1947, was made in exercise of the powers conferred by.. sub-s. (1) of s. 9 and in pursuance of sub-s. (1) of s. II of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, and was published on August 11, 1947. The Independence Order, 1947, was made in exercise of the powers conferred by s. 9 of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, and was published on August 14, 1947. Both came into force at once. Article 3 of the Defence Order, 1947, states:
Article 8, so far as it is relevant, is in these terms:
The Independence Order, 1947, states in Art. 2 that the 'appointed day' means the fifteenth August, 1947. Article 3 so far as it is relevant for our purpose, states:
Article 8(1), which is very important for our purpose, is in these terms:
and all rights and liabilities which have accrued or may accrue under any such contract shall, to the extent to which they would have been rights or liabilities of the Governor- General in Council, be rights or liabilities of the Dominion of Pakistan or the Dominion of India, as the case may be. "
It is further clear that the first part of Art. 8(1) creates a legal fiction. The contract is actually made before August 15, 1947, (the appointed day); but as from that date, the contract shall be deemed to have been made on behalf of the Dominion of Pakistan, if the contract is for purposes which as from that day are exclusively purposes of the Dominion of Pakistan, and in any other case it shall be deemed to have been made on behalf of the Dominion of India. What is the proper meaning of the expression " a contract for the exclusive purposes of the Dominion of Pakistan"? We assent to the view expressed by Chagla C.J. in Union of India v. Chinu Bhai Jeshingbhai (3). Said the learned Chief Justice-
This, we think, is the correct test to apply for determining the true scope and effect of Art. 8(1) of the Independence Order, 1947, and applying this test, there is no doubt that the contract in question comes under cl. (a) of the said Article. The purpose of the contract was to supply fodder to the Manager, Military Farms, Lahore Cantonment, which farms were in Pakistan on the appointed day. The contract was, therefore (1) A.T.R. 1954 Cal. 623.
The second question is-do the provisions of the Defence Order, 1947, make any difference in the legal position ? The High Court thought, erroneously in our opinion, that they did. It is true that cl. (2) of Art. 3 of the Independence Order, 1947, says that nothing in that Order affects the powers of control over military plant, machinery, equipment and stores conferred on the Joint Defence Council by the Defence Order' 1947. Clause (3) of Art. 3 of the Independence Order, 1947, states that the powers of control over property conferred upon each Dominion by the Order shall include all powers of use, consumption, management etc. This, however, is subject to such powers of control as are given to the Joint Defence Council. Those powers of control are laid down in Art. 8 of the Defence Order, 1947, el. (c) of which relates to "the allocation, transfer and movement for the purposes of such reconstitution of plant, machinery, equipment and stores held by the' Governor- General in Council immediately before the 15th day of August, 1947, for the purposes of the Indian forces." The point which is to be emphasised is that what is saved by cl. (2) of Art. 3 of the Independence Order, 1947, is 'Powers of control' of the Joint Defence Council with regard to certain essential military equipment etc. includingstores. There is no provision in the Defence Order, 1947, which affects the rights and liabilities of any of the two Dominions aris. ing out of a contract, and those rights and liabilities are dealt with by the Independence Order, 1947. The learned Judges of the High Court thought that the Defence Order, 1947, made a difference in the legal position in so far as the purpose of the contract was concerned. They realised and said that ordinarily the purpose of supplying fodder to the Military Farms at Lahore was a purpose exclusively for the Dominion of Pakistan; but they thought that on the assumption that 'bhoosa' was military store, the Joint Defence Council had powers of control over it and could send it wherever they wanted it to be sent; therefore, they said that the purpose of the contract was not a purpose exclusively for the Dominion of Pakistan. We say this with great respect, but this line of reasoning appears to us to be due to a lack of proper appreciation of the distinction between the "purpose of the contract" and the "ultimate disposal of the goods" supplied under the contract. The purpose of the contract is not determined nor modified by the ultimate disposal of the goods supplied under the contract, nor even by the powers of control exercised over the goods after the contract had been performed by the respondent. Wherever the goods might be ultimately sent, the purpose of the contract remained what it was, that is, to supply fodder to the Manager, Military Farms, Lahore, which, on the test laid down by us, was clearly a purpose exclusively for the Dominion of Pakistan. The Independence Order, 1947, determines the respective rights and liabilities under contracts. If, under the Defence Order, 1947, some goods the liability for the price of which under the Independence Order, 1947, falls on, say, India, are allotted to Pakistan, then the value thereof will have to be adjusted in accounts. Such allotment does not alter the rights or liabilities determined under the Independence Order, 1947. We are, therefore, of the view that the High Court of Punjab was in error in inferring that on the strength of certain provisons of the Defence Order, 1947, the contract in question came within el. (b) of Art. 8(1), and not cl. (a). We think that the learned Subordinate Judge correctly held that cl. (a) applied and the Union of India had no liability under the contract. Only a few words are necessary to dispose of the third contention urged before us. The claim in the present case was a claim for a refund of the price paid for 24 bundles of wire coils and of the security deposit. Such a claim did not relate to military stores, and the Defence Order, 1947, had no direct application to such a claim. It was only for examining the purpose of the contract that the question of 'bhoosa' being military store arose. The High Court assumed that 'bhoosa' was military store. Without deciding whether 'bhoosa' is military store or not, we have also proceeded on the same assumption; but even on that assumption, there is no difference in the legal position. The purpose of the contract was still a purpose which, as from the appointed day, was a purpose exclusively for the Dominion of Pakistan. It is worthy of note that el. (c) of Art. 8 of the Defence Order, 1947, relates inter alia to stores held by the Governor-General in Council immediately before August 15, 1947, for the purposes of the Indian forces. There was nothing in the record to show that the 'bhoosa' supplied by the respondent in 1945 was held by the Governor-General in Council immediately before August 15, 1947, so as to vest the power of control in the Joint Defence Council and thereby affect the purpose of the contract, assuming, though we do not so decide, that such power of control can affect the purpose of the contract.

The original contract was not produced in this case, as it was not available in the appropriate office in India. The respondent did not even produce a copy thereof, but gave oral evidence as to the purpose of the contract. The Courts below proceeded on that oral evidence, and the appeal was argued before us on that footing. We have determined the purpose of the contract as on August 15, 1947, on the basis of that evidence, without deciding the further question if oral evidence was admissible in this case as to the purpose of the contract.
For the reasons given above, we allow this appeal, set aside the judgment and decree of the High Court, and restore those of the learned Subordinate Judge. The appellant will get costs throughout.
