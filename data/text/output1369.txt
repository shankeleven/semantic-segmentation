1959.- December 7. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by S. E. Das J. S. K. DAS J.-This is an appeal by special leave from a decision of the High Court of Bombay, dated January 31, 1955, by which it dismissed with costs a writ application (No. 1100 of 1954) made by the petitioners therein, who are now appellants before us. It raises for consideration and decision a land revenue problem of some complexity, which resulted from the enactment of the Bombay Taluqdari Tenure Abolition Act, 1949, (Bombay Act LXII of 1949), hereinafter referred to as the Abolition Act. The problem is if the appellants, holders of certain lands known as "Lalliti " lands, are liable to the State Government concerned for payment of land revenue under the provisions of the Bombay Land Revenue Code, 1879 (Bombay Act V of 1879), hereinafter referred to as the Revenue Code' after the enforcement of the provisions of the Abolition Act.

(land revenue) since the pre-British rule, though the circumstances in which their predecessors originally got the lands are lost in antiquity. They said inter alia that the exemption from payment of land revenue which they had all along enjoyed was not affected by the Abolition Act or by any later legislation like the Bombay Personal Inams Abolition Act, 1952 (Bombay Act LXII of 1953), and that the demand for payment of land revenue made by the State Government of Bombay for 1950-1953 was not authorised by law. In the alternative, they also said that they were not liable to any assessment of land revenue till August, 1953. Accordingly, they prayed for appropriate writs (a) quashing the demands for payment of land revenue and (b) directing the State of Bombay, the Collector of Ahmedabad and the Revenue Officer of Dhanduka (who are now respondents before us), to forbear from taking any steps to enforce payment of land revenue for the " Lal-liti " lands held by them. A number of similar applications, presumably filed by other holders of "Lal-liti" lands, were also pending in the High Court, So far as we can gather from the record before us, there were three sets of such applications. The High court delivered its leading judgment on writ application No. 1098 of 1954 and the application of the appellants herein (No. 1100 of 1954) was dismissed with costs on the grounds given in the leading judgment. The High Court held in effect that the holders of " Lal-liti " lands were liable to payment of land revenue under s. 5 of the Abolition Act, read with the provisions of the Revenue Code, and the objections raised thereto, on their behalf were not legally valid. Having been unsuccessful in their application for a certificate under Article 133(1)(c) of the Constitution, the appellants applied for and obtained special leave from this Court on June 29, 1955. They then preferred the present appeal.
Learned counsel for the appellants has challenged the correctness of the decision of the High Court on various grounds. It will be convenient to take these one by one. The first point urged is that the relevant provisions of the Abolition Act do not apply to " Lal-liti " lands, which are not " taluqdari lands " within the meaning of the Abolition Act, and, therefore, no liability for payment of land revenue in respect of " Lal-liti " lands can arise under s. 5 thereof. At this stage, we must read the relevant provisions of the Abolition Act. The expressions "
Now, the argument on behalf of the appellants has proceeded on the following lines; learned counsel for them has submitted that the expression " Taluqdari land " is defined as land forming part of a taluqdari estate; but the expression " taluqdari estate" is not defined, though the expression " Taluqdari tenure " is defined; therefore, taluqdari estate can only mean, such land or estate in which the taluqdar has some subsisting interest; but in " Lal-liti " lands, at least of the taluqdar retains no interest after the grant, and, therefore, " Lal-liti " land is not taluqdari land within the meaning of s. 5 of the Abolition Act. We have now to consider the soundness of this line of argument. In the High Court as also before us an attempt was made on behalf of the respondents to establish that the taluqdar retained a reversionary right to " Lalliti " lands in case the holder died without any heir. The High Court said rightly in our opinion, that on the materials placed before it, it could not be said that the respondents had established that position. The High Court then considered the meaning of the expression ' taluqdari estate' and said that it was used in a descriptive sense and was not equivalent to the expression 'Taluqdar'sestate'. Said the High Court:
and (b) of sub-section (1) of s. 5 are read together, the only reasonable conclusion is that clause (a) is merely declaratory and clause (b) is the operative clause and according to that operative clause, the persons who become liable for payment of land revenue are only two in number, namely, (1) a taluqdar holding any taluqdari land and (2) a cadet of a taluqdari family holding any taluqdari land with hereditary rights for the purpose of maintenance immediately before the coming into force of the Abolition Act, and, therefore, the holder of " Lal-liti " lands, assuming them to be taluqdari lands, has no liability under s. 5(1); secondly, it is contended that even if clauses (a) and (b) of subsection (1) of s. 5 are read distributively the holder of Lal-liti " lands has still no liability, because cl. (a) makes taluqdari lands liable to the payment of land revenue in accordance with the provisions of the Revenue Code and there is no provision in that Code under which a " Lal-liti " holder can be made liable to the payment of land revenue. We take the first part of the argument first. How should we read clauses (a) and (b) of sub-section (1) of s. 5 of the Abolition Act ? Learned counsel for the appellants states that if clause (a) is also read as a clause which operates to charge all taluqdari lands with liability for payment of land revenue, then clause (b) becomes a wholly unnecessary surplusage. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents points out that if the intention was to fasten liability on two categories of persons only, taluqdars and cadets, then clause (a) was really unnecessary. We think that both the clauses have a meaning and purpose. Clause
The question is if the holder of " Lal-liti " lands is, after the Abolition Act, an occupant of unalienated land within the meaning of s. 136; if he is, then he is liable to the payment of land revenue under s. 5(1)(a) of the Abolition Act read with s. 136 of the Revenue Code. In dealing with this question, which has caused us some anxiety, we must remember the meaning of the expressions ' occupant' and 'alienated' used in the Revenue Code. The argument on behalf of the appellants is that a " Lal-liti "
The aforesaid saving clause affords, no protection against the liability imposed by s. 5 of the Abolition Act. (2) Learned counsel also relied on s. 5(2)(a) of the Abolition Act, before its repeal by the Bombay Personal Inams Abolition Act, 1952 (Bombay Act 42 of 1953), and based his alternative claim thereon. Here again, the High Court rightly pointed out that there was no special contract in favour of the appellants as to exemption from payment of land revenue nor was there any law for the time being in force (after the Abolition Act) which granted the holder of " Lal -liti"	PetArg

We are in agreement with the view thus expressed by the High Court. Having regard to the history of the gig Lal-liti "
We do not think that those decisions are of any help to the appellants for the simple reason that the analogy does not apply; we are concerned here not with the meaning of the expression " taluqdar's estate " occurring in s. 31 of the Gujrat Taluqdars' Act, 1888, but with the meaning of a different expression, viz. " taluqdari estate " in s. 2(3) of the Abolition Act. Moreover, in some of the decisions relied on by the learned counsel, it was recognised that there was a distinction between taluqdar's estate' and 'taluqdari estate.
We were also addressed at some length on the effect of the relinquishment of his land by the taluqdar in favour of the Collector (Nathuram Hiraram Thakur v. The Secretary of State for India(4)) or the effect of an attachment of the village under s. 144 of the Revenue Code on failure of the taluqdar to pay the assessment (Tulla Sobharam Pandya v. The Collector of Kaira (5)). We do not think that it is necessary in the present case to consider those questions. We now go to the second point urged on behalf of the appellants. This point was not urged before, nor considered by, the High Court in the writ application in which it gave its leading judgment. The appellants wished to urge the point in the High Court on their own application, but were told that if the decision of the High Court in Writ Application No. 1098 of 1954 was wrong, it could be corrected only by this Court. The argument on this point is based on s. 5(1) of the Abolition Act, which we have quoted earlier, and is in two parts: firstly, it is contended that if clauses (a) (1) (1907) 9 Bom. L.R. 1122.

(5) (1918) 20 Bom. L.R. 748.	Precedent
The problem has to be considered in the light. of certain incidents of taluqdari tenures in the Ahmedabad district of Gujrat, with special reference to the changes through which those tenures had gone in the past by legislation or otherwise. For the purposes of this appeal it is not necessary to give a full history of taluqdari estates in Gujrat; but it is necessary to explain what is meant by "
but very soon a significant change took place and the nature of the payment was altered, and instead of tribute, the Government assumed it to be rent or revenue. The rent or revenue was also increased by about 50 per cent. and the result was that the holders of these lands fell into pecuniary embarrassment and became impoverished and needy. A system of annual leases was then introduced: this remedy, however, proved worse than the disease, and it was sought to improve the'position of the Taluqdars by legislation it is not necessary for our purpose to refer to the details of that legislation till we come to the Gujrat Taluqdars' Act, 1888 (Bombay Act VI of f888), -which was a landmark in the history of Taluqdari tenures. We shall have occasion later to refer to some of the provisions of this Act. It is sufficient to state here that by the time the aforesaid Act was passed the Taluqdars of certain districts of Gujrat including Ahmedabad had really become mere owners of proprietary estates, who held lands directly from Government,and the Act provided, inter alia, for the revenue administration of their estates. Under the provisions of the Act, the Settlement Registers were prepared for each village, which served the purpose of the Record of Rights in those estates. In these estates, large areas of lands were granted presumably by the Taluqdars to cadets, widows of the family, and relations for maintenance, and to village servants and others, either in reward for past services or as remuneration for services to be performed. The holders of these transferred lands paid no revenue either to the Taluqdar or to Government generally. These grants fell into three categories: (i) those made prior to British rule ;
Such, in brief, is the history of Taluqdari estates and "
Section 5, which is of great importance for the purpose of this appeal, read as follows before it was amended in 1953. Section 5 (1) " Subject to the provisions of subsection (2),
(a)all taluqdari lands are and shall be liable to the payment of land revenue in accordance with the provisions of the Code and the rules made there- under, and
(b)a taluqdar holding any taluqdari land or a cadet of a taluqdari family any taluqdari land hereditarily for the purpose of maintenance immediately before the coming into force of this Act, shall be deemed to be an occupant within the meaning of the Code or any other law for the time being in force.
(2)Nothing in sub-section (1) shall be deemed to affect-
(a)the right of any person to hold any taluqdari land wholly or partially exempt from payment of land revenue under special contract or any law for the time being in force;
(b)the right of any person to pay Jama under any agreement or settlement recognised under section 23 or under a declaration made under section 22 of the Taluqdars' Act so long as such agreement, settlement or declaration remains in force under the provisions of this Act."
(a) makes all taluqdari lands liable to the payment of land revenue in accordance with the provisions of the Revenue Code. Section 3 of the Abolition Act abolishes taluqdari tenure and extinguishes all its incidents. If there was only abolition of taluqdari tenures without anything more, there would have been a void. Obviously enough, it was necessary to say what would happen to taluqdari lands after abolition of the taluqdari tenure. Therefore, clause (a) states that all taluqdari lands shall be liable, to the payment of land revenue in accordance with the provisions of the Revenue Code. What then is the meaning of clause (b)? It is a deeming provision by which the taluqdar and his cadet shall be deemed to be an occupant within the meaning of the Revenue Code; and I occupant' under the Revenue Code means a holder in actual possession of unalienated land'.The word 'alienated' has also a special meaning in the Revenue Code; it means I transferred in so far as the rights of Government to payment of rent or land revenue are concerned, wholly or partially, to the ownership of any person'. Clause (b) merely clarifies the position of the taluqdar and his cadet under the Abolition Act; it does not in any way derogate from clause (a); nor does it cut down the width of amplitude of clause (a). We are of the view that clauses (a) and (b) should be read together, but not in the sense suggested by the learned counsel for the appellants. Clause (b) clarifies the position as respects two categories of persons; but that does not mean that if a third category of persons properly come under clause (a), they will not be liable to payment of land revenue on a specious and unwarranted assumption that clause (b) as the operating clause cuts down the amplitude of clause (a). The true view is that clause (a) is a general provision and applies the Revenue Code to all taluqdari lands, while clause (b) is a particular deeming provision with regard to the taluqdar and his cadet.
Now, as to the second part of the argument. It is necessary to read here s. 136(1) of the Revenue Code:	Section

1959.- December 7. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by S. E. Das J. S. K. DAS J.-This is an appeal by special leave from a decision of the High Court of Bombay, dated January 31, 1955, by which it dismissed with costs a writ application (No. 1100 of 1954) made by the petitioners therein, who are now appellants before us.

The problem has to be considered in the light. of certain incidents of taluqdari tenures in the Ahmedabad district of Gujrat, with special reference to the changes through which those tenures had gone in the past by legislation or otherwise. For the purposes of this appeal it is not necessary to give a full history of taluqdari estates in Gujrat; but it is necessary to explain what is meant by "

The holders of these transferred lands paid no revenue either to the Taluqdar or to Government generally. These grants fell into three categories: (i) those made prior to British rule ;
(ii) those made between 1818 and 1888, that is, after the introduction of British rule and before the passing of the Gujrat Taluqdars' Act, 1888 ; and (iii) those made after 1888. The lands thus transferred were called " Lal-liti "

Such, in brief, is the history of Taluqdari estates and "
(land revenue) since the pre-British rule, though the circumstances in which their predecessors originally got the lands are lost in antiquity. They said inter alia that the exemption from payment of land revenue which they had all along enjoyed was not affected by the Abolition Act or by any later legislation like the Bombay Personal Inams Abolition Act, 1952 (Bombay Act LXII of 1953), and that the demand for payment of land revenue made by the State Government of Bombay for 1950-1953 was not authorised by law.

(b)the right of any person to pay Jama under any agreement or settlement recognised under section 23 or under a declaration made under section 22 of the Taluqdars' Act so long as such agreement, settlement or declaration remains in force under the provisions of this Act."
Now, the argument on behalf of the appellants has proceeded on the following lines; learned counsel for them has submitted that the expression " Taluqdari land " is defined as land forming part of a taluqdari estate; but the expression " taluqdari estate" is not defined, though the expression " Taluqdari tenure " is defined; therefore, taluqdari estate can only mean, such land or estate in which the taluqdar has some subsisting interest; but in " Lal-liti " lands, at least of the taluqdar retains no interest after the grant, and, therefore, " Lal-liti " land is not taluqdari land within the meaning of s. 5 of the Abolition Act. We have now to consider the soundness of this line of argument. In the High Court as also before us an attempt was made on behalf of the respondents to establish that the taluqdar retained a reversionary right to " Lalliti " lands in case the holder died without any heir. The High Court said rightly in our opinion, that on the materials placed before it, it could not be said that the respondents had established that position. The High Court then considered the meaning of the expression ' taluqdari estate' and said that it was used in a descriptive sense and was not equivalent to the expression 'Taluqdar'sestate'. Said the High Court:
We are in agreement with the view thus expressed by the High Court. Having regard to the history of the gig Lal-liti "
We do not think that those decisions are of any help to the appellants for the simple reason that the analogy does not apply; we are concerned here not with the meaning of the expression " taluqdar's estate " occurring in s. 31 of the Gujrat Taluqdars' Act, 1888, but with the meaning of a different expression, viz.

The appellants wished to urge the point in the High Court on their own application, but were told that if the decision of the High Court in Writ Application No. 1098 of 1954 was wrong, it could be corrected only by this Court. The argument on this point is based on s. 5(1) of the Abolition Act, which we have quoted earlier, and is in two parts: firstly, it is contended that if clauses (a) (1) (1907) 9 Bom. L.R. 1122.
(2) (1909) 11 Bom. L.R. 736.
(3) (191O) 12 Bom. L.R. 903.
(4) (1929) 32 Bom. L.R. 907.
(5) (1918) 20 Bom. L.R. 748.
and (b) of sub-section (1) of s. 5 are read together, the only reasonable conclusion is that clause (a) is merely declaratory and clause (b) is the operative clause and according to that operative clause, the persons who become liable for payment of land revenue are only two in number, namely, (1) a taluqdar holding any taluqdari land and (2) a cadet of a taluqdari family holding any taluqdari land with hereditary rights for the purpose of maintenance immediately before the coming into force of the Abolition Act, and, therefore, the holder of " Lal-liti " lands, assuming them to be taluqdari lands, has no liability under s. 5(1); secondly, it is contended that even if clauses (a) and (b) of subsection (1) of s. 5 are read distributively the holder of Lal-liti " lands has still no liability, because cl.

On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents points out that if the intention was to fasten liability on two categories of persons only, taluqdars and cadets, then clause (a) was really unnecessary. We think that both the clauses have a meaning and purpose. Clause
(a) makes all taluqdari lands liable to the payment of land revenue in accordance with the provisions of the Revenue Code. Section 3 of the Abolition Act abolishes taluqdari tenure and extinguishes all its incidents. If there was only abolition of taluqdari tenures without anything more, there would have been a void. Obviously enough, it was necessary to say what would happen to taluqdari lands after abolition of the taluqdari tenure.

Now, as to the second part of the argument. It is necessary to read here s. 136(1) of the Revenue Code:
The question is if the holder of " Lal-liti " lands is, after the Abolition Act, an occupant of unalienated land within the meaning of s. 136; if he is, then he is liable to the payment of land revenue under s. 5(1)(a) of the Abolition Act read with s. 136 of the Revenue Code. In dealing with this question, which has caused us some anxiety, we must remember the meaning of the expressions ' occupant' and 'alienated' used in the Revenue Code. The argument on behalf of the appellants is that a " Lal-liti "
The aforesaid saving clause affords, no protection against the liability imposed by s. 5 of the Abolition Act. (2) Learned counsel also relied on s. 5(2)(a) of the Abolition Act, before its repeal by the Bombay Personal Inams Abolition Act, 1952 (Bombay Act 42 of 1953), and based his alternative claim thereon. Here again, the High Court rightly pointed out that there was no special contract in favour of the appellants as to exemption from payment of land revenue nor was there any law for the time being in force (after the Abolition Act) which granted the holder of " Lal -liti"
For the reasons given above, we hold that the appellants have failed to show that the decision of the High Court is wrong. The appeal is accordingly dimissed with costs.
