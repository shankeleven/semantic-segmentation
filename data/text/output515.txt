2. The High Court answered the question in the negative for reasons set out in its judgment covering this case as well as the case out of which Appeal No. 19 of 1953 came to be filed before us.
3. The facts, found in this case, are similar to those found in Civil Appeal No. 19 of 1953 Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay v. Messrs, Ogale Glass Works Ltd., except in the following particulars :
4. Learned counsel on either side did not suggest that the differences noted above would make any difference in the answer to the referred question which is the same as in the other appeal.

We accordingly allow the appeal and answer the referred question in the affirmative. For reason similar to those referred to in our judgment in that appeal each party must bear and pay his or its own costs both in this Court and in the High Court.
