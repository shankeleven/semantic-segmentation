Maharajadhiraj Sir Kameshwar Singh vs The State Of Bihar on 15 May, 1959	Case Title
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 254 of 1954. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated February 19, 1952, of the Patna High Court in Misc. Judl. Case No. 244 of 1949.
B. Sen, S. K. Majumdar and I. N. Shrojj, for the appellant.
1959. May 15. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by HIDAYATULLAH J.-This appeal, with the special leave of this Court, has been filed by Maharajadhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singh of Darbhanga (hereinafter referred to as the assessee) against the judgment of the High Court of Patna dated February 19, 1952, by which the High Court answered in the affirmative the following: two questions referred to it under s. 25(1) of the Bihar Agricultural Income-tax Act, 1938:
and brought only the remaining income (after some minor adjustments) to tax. His order was passed on August 20, 1946. In the year 1948, the Privy Council reversed the Patna High Court's decision. The judgment of the Privy Council is reported in Commissioner of Income-tax v. Kamakshya Narain Singh('). The Income-tax Officer then issued a notice under s. 34 of the Indian Income-tax Act, and after hearing the party assessed the sum of Rs. 93,604. After sundry procedure which it is not necessary to detail, the matter reached this Court, and the question which was before it was " whether in the circumstances of the case, the assessment order under s. 34 of the Act of the interest on arrears of rent is legal."	Issue
The facts of the case lie within a very narrow com. pass. For the assessment year 1944-45 which corresponded to the year of account 1351 Fasli, the assessee returned Rs. 37,43,520 as his agricultural income. He claimed a deduction of Rs. 9,42,137-3-10 1/2 on account of land revenue, rent etc., including a sum of Rs. 2,82,192 shown to have been paid to the Tekari Raj from which two leasehold properties were taken on zarpeshgi lease by indentures dated August 15, 1931, and January 31, 1936, respectively. The amount was sought to be deducted as a capital receipt. The Agricultural Income-tax Officer of Darbhanga by his order dated December 28, 1945 accepted this contention, and exempted the amount from payment of agricultural income-tax. He observed:
The assessment was approved by the Assistant Commissioner of Agricultural Income-tax on January 4, 1946, and on the day following, the Income-tax Officer passed his formal order and issued a demand notice.
After the assessee appeared, a supplementary assessment order was passed and Rs. 39,512-6-0 were assessed as tax on Rs. 2,52,879.	Facts
the department justified the assessee's claim that the said income was not liable to be assessed to tax. There is no doubt that a part of the assessee's income had not been assessed and, in that sense, it has clearly escaped assessment. Can it be said that, because the matter was considered and decided on' the merits in the light of the binding authority of the decision of the Patna High Court, no income has escaped assessment when the said Patna High Court decision has been subsequently reversed by the Privy Council? We see no justification for holding that cases of income escaping assessment must always be cases where income has not been assessed owing to inadvertence or oversight or owing to the fact that no return has been submitted. In our opinion, even in a case where a return has been ,submitted, if the Income-tax Officer erroneously fails to tax a part of assessable income, it is a case where the said part of the income has escaped assessment. The appellant's attempt to put a very narrow and artificial limitation on the meaning of the word "escape' in s. 34(1)(b) cannot therefore succeed."
The learned counsel for the assessee in his careful argument took us through the two documents and endeavoured to prove that the relation of debtor and creditor subsisted between the parties. He referred us to cl. 4, which embodies a provision entitling the lessee to deduct 12 1/2 per cent. of the gross aggregate amount payable by the mokarraridars as expenses of collection and other charges incidental thereto after payment of rent reserved to the I lessor' and to appropriate to himself the remainder. He submitted that the payment to the lessor was not a premium but a loan and the intention was that the lessee or creditor would be thus repaid.
The learned counsel for the assessee next drew our attention to the last clause of the instrument of January 31, 1936. That, however, was a special covenant, and the provision therein was in relation to matters not covered by the instrument.	PetArg
M. C. Setalvad, Attorney-General for India, B. K. Saran and R. C. Prasad, for the respondent.	RespArg
In deciding the matter, the Agricultural Income-tax Officer gave the following reasons:
Commissioner of Income-tax v. Raja of Parlakimedi (1) Chimanram Moti Lal (Gold and Silver), Bombay v. Commissioner of Income-tax (Central), Bombay (2) and Madan Mohan Lal v. Commissioner of Income-tax (3). The learned Attorney- General also relied strongly upon a recent decision of this Court in Kamal Singh v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Bihar and Orissa (4), where Gajendragadkar, J., after a review of all the authorities, held that s. 34 of the Indian Income- tax Act was applicable to a case where an item of income was returned but deliberately and after consideration, was held to be not liable to tax. Learned counsel for the assessee contends that the point was left open in that case, and refers to Messrs. Chatturam Horilram Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income'-tax, Bihar and Orissa(5) as having held the contrary.
Before referring to the other authorities of the High Courts, it will be proper to see if the two cases of the Supreme Court are in point or not, and if so, which of them. In Kamal Singh's case (4), the point arose under the following circumstances. The father of the appellant in that case was assessed to income-tax for the year 1945-46. The total income assessed to incometax was Rs. 1,00,000 which included a sum of RE;. 93,604 received by him on account of interest on arrears of rent due to him after deduction of collection charges. It was urged before the Income-tax Officer that this interest was not assessable to income-tax being agricultural "income, in view of the decision of the Patna High Court in Kamakshya Narain Singh v. Commissioner of Income-tax(6). The Income-tax Officer did not accept this contention on the ground that an appeal was pending against the Patna High Court's decision, before the Privy Council. On appeal, the Appellate Assistant Commissioner held that the Income-tax Officer was bound to follow the decision of the High Court, and he set aside the order and directed the Income-tax Officer to make a fresh assessment. The Income-tax Officer thereupon deducted the amount (1) (1926) I.L.R. 49 Mad. 22.
(4) A.I.R. 1959 S.C. 257.
(5) [1955] 2 S-C.R. 290.
The assessee seeks to distinguish that case on the ground that this Court,laid down the law in the special circumstances where' a new interpretation to the law was given, and that it was not a case of the Incometax Officer changing his mind. He contends that there was at least some information which had come to the Income-tax Officer, on which his subsequent action could be rested. The learned counsel argued that Gajendragadkar, J., had expressly left the question open, where there was no information but the Incometax Officer merely changed his mind without any information from an external source. Reference in this connection is made to the following observations in the judgment:
The facts of the case were entirely different. The income was returned, and was not yet processed when the notice under s. 34 was issued. The key to the case is furnished by the approval by their Lordships of the observations of Rankin, C.J., in In re: Lachhiram Basantlal (1) that:
That those observations were related to the facts then before their Lordships is clear from the following passage:
It was in the context of the pendency of assessment proceedings that the remarks were made, and the matter is decisively cleared of any doubt by the following passage:
provides the only means available to the Crown of remedying the omission, but that is a different matter." In our opinion, the error in the cases relied upon by the assessee arises in using the dicta in the above case, shorn of the context in which they were made and applying them to facts, where they cannot. The judgment of Gajendragadkar, J., has dealt with the matter, if we may say so respectfully, very adequately and we do not consider it necessary to cover the same ground again. The preponderance of opinion in the High Courts is also to accept the contrary view, and we think rightly.
The learned counsel for the assessee argued that the decision of this Court in Messrs. Chatturam Horilram Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Bihar& Orissa (1) discloses a different view, and that we should follow it in preference to the later view of Gajendragadkar, J. We do not think that in the case last cited the point was the same. The same case was relied upon before the Bench of Venkatarama Aiyar, Gajendragadkar and Sarkar, JJ., and Gajondragadkar, J., distinguished it This is what he observed:
Subsequently the Governor of Bihar promulgated the Bihar Regulation IV of 1942 and thereby brought into force the Indian Finance Act of 1939, in Chota Nagpur retrospectively as from March 30, 1939. This ordinance was -assented to by the Governor-General. On February 8, 1944, the Income Tax Officer passed an order in pursuance of which proceedings were taken against (1)[1955] 2 S.C.R. 290.
This brings us to the second question. The income was received from the leasehold properties, and was agricultural income. The contention of the assessee is that it may be agricultural income in the hands of the Tekari Raj but -in his hands it was capital receipt and in repayment of the loan of about Rs. 17,00,000 paid to Ram Bhuwaneshwari Kuer. The State of Bihar, however, denies that there was a loan or a mortgage at all. The assessee, it is contended, was placed in possession for a number of years on a rent of Rs. 1,000 per year and the amount paid was premium and not a loan.	Precedent
Necessarily, therefore, the rulings on the interpretation of the latter section were freely cited by the contending parties. Section 26 of the Act reads as follows:
For facility of reference, the previous s. 34 before the amendment in 1948 of the Indian Income-tax Act may likewise be quoted here. It read:
(2) (1942) I.L. R. 1943 Bom. 206.
(3) [1935] 3 I.T.R. 438.
(6) [I946] 14 I.T.R. 673.
Two questions were involved. The first was whether the word " information " was wide enough to include knowledge about the state of the law or about a decision on a point of law. With that point we are., not concerned in this case. The second was, when income could be said to have escaped assessment. Emphasis was laid on the word " assessment " in the arguments, and it was contended that it denoted not merely the order of assessment, but included " all steps taken for the purpose of levying of tax and during the process of taxation. " It was also contended that " escaped " meant that the income must have eluded observation, search etc., or, in other words, eluded the notice of the Income- tax Officer. Gajendragadkar, J., however, did not confine the phrase to such a narrow meaning. He observed;
We may say at once that the words of s. 26 of the Act do not involve possessing of or coming by some fresh information. The section says:
Their Lordships held that the expression "has escaped assessment" should not be read as equivalent to "has not been assessed" because so to do "gives too arrow a meaning to the word 'assessment' and too wide a meaning to the word escaped'."	Section
For the reasons we have given, we are of opinion that the Agricultural Income-tax Officer was competent under s. 26 of the Act to assess an item of income which he had omitted to tax earlier, even though in the return that income was included and the Agricultural Income-tax Officer then thought that it was exempt. The answer given by the High Court was therefore correct.
That the income from this leasehold property which was land, would fall within the definition of " agricultural income "	Conclusion

and brought only the remaining income (after some minor adjustments) to tax. His order was passed on August 20, 1946. In the year 1948, the Privy Council reversed the Patna High Court's decision.

This ordinance was -assented to by the Governor-General. On February 8, 1944, the Income Tax Officer passed an order in pursuance of which proceedings were taken against (1)[1955] 2 S.C.R. 290.
the assessee under the provisions of s. 34 and they resulted in the assessment of the assessee to incometax. The contention which was raised by the assessee in his appeal to this Court was that the notice issued against him under s. 34 was invalid. This Court held that the income, profits or gains sought to be assessed were chargeable to income-tax and that it was a case of chargeable income escaping assessment within the meaning of s. 34 and was not a case of mere non-assessment of income-tax. So far as the decision is concerned, it is in substance inconsistent with the argument raised by Mr. Sastri. He, however, relies on the observations -made by Jagannadhadas, J., that 'the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that the escapement from assessment is not to be equated to non- assessment simpliciter is not without force' and he points out that the reason given by the learned Judge in support of the final decisions was that though earlier assessment proceedings had been taken they had failed to result in a valid assessment owing to some lacuna other than that attributable to the assessing authorities notwithstanding the chargeability of income to the tax. Mr. Sastri says that it is only in cases where income can be shown to have escaped assessment owing to some lacuna other than that attributable to the assessing authorities that s. 34 can be invoked. We do not think that a fair reading of the judgment can lead to this conclusion. The observations on which reliance is placed by Mr. Sastri have naturally been made in reference to the facts with which the Court was dealing and they must obviously be read in the context of those facts. It would be unreasonable to suggest that these observations were intended to confine the application of s. 34 only to cases where income escapes assessment owing to reasons other than those attributable to the assessing authorities. Indeed Jagannadbadas J., has taken the precaution of adding that it was unnecessary to lay down what exactly constitutes escapment from assessment and that it would be sufficient to place their decision on 44 the narrow ground to which we have just referred. We are satisfied that this decision is of no assistance to the appellant's case."
For the reasons we have given, we are of opinion that the Agricultural Income-tax Officer was competent under s. 26 of the Act to assess an item of income which he had omitted to tax earlier, even though in the return that income was included and the Agricultural Income-tax Officer then thought that it was exempt. The answer given by the High Court was therefore correct.
This brings us to the second question. The income was received from the leasehold properties, and was agricultural income. The contention of the assessee is that it may be agricultural income in the hands of the Tekari Raj but -in his hands it was capital receipt and in repayment of the loan of about Rs. 17,00,000 paid to Ram Bhuwaneshwari Kuer. The State of Bihar, however, denies that there was a loan or a mortgage at all. The assessee, it is contended, was placed in possession for a number of years on a rent of Rs. 1,000 per year and the amount paid was premium and not a loan.
The documents in question are two. They are plainly indentures of lease between the Rani and the. assessee. From these documents it is clear that in consideration of a payment of Rs. 17,16,000 the lessee was placed in possession of the leasehold property for 28 years. There is no express term which makes the sum a loan returnable either by repayment or by the enjoyment of the usufruct. There is no interest fixed or right of redemption granted. There is no provision for any Personal liability in case any amount remained outstanding at the end of the term of 28 years. These are the tests to apply to find out whether the transaction was one of zarpeshgi lease or a lease with a mortgage. See Mulla's' Transfer of Property Act, 4th Edition, page 352.
The learned counsel for the assessee in his careful argument took us through the two documents and endeavoured to prove that the relation of debtor and creditor subsisted between the parties. He referred us to cl. 4, which embodies a provision entitling the lessee to deduct 12 1/2 per cent. of the gross aggregate amount payable by the mokarraridars as expenses of collection and other charges incidental thereto after payment of rent reserved to the I lessor' and to appropriate to himself the remainder. He submitted that the payment to the lessor was not a premium but a loan and the intention was that the lessee or creditor would be thus repaid.
The clause by itself may admit of diverse constructions, and possibly one such construction may be the one suggested, but that is not the true purport of the clause read in the context of the rest of the instrument. To interpret this clause the instrument must be read as a whole, and when so viewed, it is found that it provides for an exemption of the lessor from the liability for collection charges. It places beyond doubt that the collection charges were not to be debited to the lessor but were to be borne by the lessee. Unless such a provision was included in the instrument, it might have been a matter of some dispute as to who was to be responsible for this expenditure.
The learned counsel for the assessee next drew our attention to the last clause of the instrument of January 31, 1936. That, however, was a special covenant, and the provision therein was in relation to matters not covered by the instrument.
That the income from this leasehold property which was land, would fall within the definition of " agricultural income "	Total Judgement
