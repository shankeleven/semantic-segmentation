3. This court had to consider the validity of a more or less similar bye- law made by the Municipal Board, Kairana which provided that no. person shall establish any new market or place for wholesale transactions of vegetables without obtaining the previous permission of the Board, and another bye-law which permitted the grant of a monopoly to a contractor to deal in wholesale transactions at the place fixed as a market. The monopoly to do wholesale business in vegetables was auctioned by the Board to the highest bidder and a place was also fixed as the market where such business could be carried on. A person who had been carrying on wholesale business in vegetables before the bye-laws came into force applied for a license to carry on his business at his shop but his application was rejected and he was prosecuted for contravention of the bye-laws. This court upheld the fundamental right of the aggrieved person under Article 19(1)(g) and held that the prohibition imposed by the bye-law became absolute in the absence of provisions authorising the issue of a licence and as the Municipal Board had put it out of its power to grant a license by granting a monopoly, the restrictions imposed were not reasonable within the meaning of Article 19(1) (g) of the Constitution & the bye-laws were accordingly void. See - 'Rashid Ahmed v. Municipal Board, Kairana', 1950 AIR(SC) 163 (A).	Precedent
