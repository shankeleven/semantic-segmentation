(g) of the Constitution have been violated by the illegal imposition of a purchase tax on certain purchases of tobacco made by it in the State of Bombay. It appears that the Sales Tax Officer, Baroda, made an order assessing the petitioner to a purchase tax under s. 14, sub-s. (6), of the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1953 (Bom. Act III of 1953) for the period April 1, 1954 to September 29, 1955.

H. J. Umrigar and T. M. Sen, for the Respondents. 1960. September 20. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAs GUPTA J.-In this petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution the petitioner, a partnership firm carrying on the business of manufacture of bidis and having its head office at Jabalpur within the State of Madhya Pradesh complain that its fundamental rights under Art. 19(1)(f) and
It is in the background of these facts that we have to consider the question whether tobacco was delivered in the State of Bombay for consumption in that State. In answering that question it is unnecessary and indeed inexpedient to attempt an exhaustive definition of the word " consumption "
Reverting to the instance of cotton, mentioned above, it will be proper to hold that when raw cotton is delivered in State A for being ginned in that State., it is delivered for consumption in State A ; when ginned cotton is delivered in State B for being spun into yarn, it is delivered for consumption in State B ; when yarn is delivered in State C for being woven into cloth in that State, it is delivered for consumption in State C; when woven cloth is delivered in State D for being made by tailor in that State into wearing apparel, there is delivery of cloth for consumption in State D; and finally when, wearing apparel is delivered in State E for being sold as dress in that State, it is delivery of wearing apparel for con- sumption in State E. Except at the final stage of consumption which consists in using the finished commodity as an article of clothing, there will be noticed at each stage of production the bringing into existence of a commercial commodity different from what was received by the producers. This conversion of a commodity into a different commercial commodity by subjecting it to some processing, is consumption with. in the meaning of the Explanation to Art. 286 no less than the final act of user when no distinct commodity is being brought into existence but what was brought into existence is being used up. At one stage of the argument what Mr. Pathak appeared to insist was that there must be destruction of the substance of the thing before the thing can be said to be consumed. That takes us nowhere, because we have still to find out what is meant by destruction of the substance. It may well be said that when a commodity is converted into a commercially different commodity its former identity is destroyed and so there is destruction of the substance, to satisfy the test suggested by the learned counsel. We think it unnecessary however to enter into a discussion of what amounts to " destruction "
therefore, that the raw cashew-nut is consumed by the respondents in the sense I have mentioned". Das, J., here proceeded on the view that using a commodity so as to turn it into a different commercial article amounts to consumption, within the meaning of the Explanation to Art. 286(1) (a)-a view which he had earlier indicated at p. 110 of the Report. We are not aware of any case where such use of a commodity has been held not to amount to consumption.	Precedent
The petitioner's contention is that bidi-tobacco which was purchased by it is not one of the goods specified in Column 4 of the said schedule. Turing to Schedule B we find there are 80 entries in the first column. Against each of these entries the second column of the schedule mentions the rates of sales tax leviable under s. 8 of the Act: the third column mentions the rate of general sales tax leviable under s. 9, while the fourth column which is the last, column men- tions the rate of purchase tax. While the entries from 1 to 79 mention specific articles, entry 80 as it stood before its amendment in 1957 was in these words:-" All goods other than those specified from time to time in Schedule A and in the preceding entries." (An amendment by the Bombay Act, 71 of 1958, added the words " and sec. 7A " after the words "	Section
It must therefore be held on the facts of this case that when tobacco was delivered in the-State of Bombay for the purpose of changing it into a commercially different article, viz., bidi patti the delivery was for the purpose of consumption. The purchases in this case therefore fall within the meaning of Explanation to Art. 286(1)(a) and must be held to have taken place inside the State of Bombay. There remains for consideration the objection that the transactions took place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce within the. meaning of Art. 286(2) of the Constitution and the levy of tax was therefore prohibited by the provisions thereof. Even if these transactions were in the course of inter-State trade, the bar of Art. 286(2) of the Constitution stands removed by the Sales Tax Laws Validation Act, for the entire period upto September 6, 1955. The levy of tax for the period September 7, 1955, to September 29, 1955, would be illegal if these transactions are in the course of inter-State trade. The petitioner's counsel however informed us that he did not want a decision on his question and would not, in this case, press his objection under Art. 286(2). It is unnecessary for us therefore to decide whether the transactions in question took place in the course of interState trade-or commerce within the meaning of Art. 286(2) of the Constitution. As the petitioner has failed to establish any, violation of its fundamental right, the petition is dismissed with costs.
Petition dismissed.	Conclusion
ORIGINAL JURISDICTION: Petition No. 125 of 1959. Petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India for enforcement of Fundamental Rights.
G.S. Pathak, A. P. Sen and J. B. Dadachanji, for the Petitioners.
H. J. Umrigar and T. M. Sen, for the Respondents. 1960. September 20. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAs GUPTA J.-In this petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution the petitioner, a partnership firm carrying on the business of manufacture of bidis and having its head office at Jabalpur within the State of Madhya Pradesh complain that its fundamental rights under Art. 19(1)(f) and
(g) of the Constitution have been violated by the illegal imposition of a purchase tax on certain purchases of tobacco made by it in the State of Bombay. It appears that the Sales Tax Officer, Baroda, made an order assessing the petitioner to a purchase tax under s. 14, sub-s. (6), of the Bombay Sales Tax Act, 1953 (Bom. Act III of 1953) for the period April 1, 1954 to September 29, 1955. The petitioner contends that this assessment was illegal inasmuch as these transactions are purchases " outside the State of Bombay "
The petitioner's contention is that bidi-tobacco which was purchased by it is not one of the goods specified in Column 4 of the said schedule. Turing to Schedule B we find there are 80 entries in the first column. Against each of these entries the second column of the schedule mentions the rates of sales tax leviable under s. 8 of the Act: the third column mentions the rate of general sales tax leviable under s. 9, while the fourth column which is the last, column men- tions the rate of purchase tax. While the entries from 1 to 79 mention specific articles, entry 80 as it stood before its amendment in 1957 was in these words:-" All goods other than those specified from time to time in Schedule A and in the preceding entries." (An amendment by the Bombay Act, 71 of 1958, added the words " and sec. 7A " after the words "
bidi Patti ". That itself is sufficient- proof that raw tobacco and bidi Patti are distinct and different commercial articles.
It is in the background of these facts that we have to consider the question whether tobacco was delivered in the State of Bombay for consumption in that State. In answering that question it is unnecessary and indeed inexpedient to attempt an exhaustive definition of the word " consumption "
consumption " to the final act of Consumption, it will be proper to think that the Constitution-makers used the word to connote any kind of user which is ordinarily spoken of as consumption of the particular commodity.
Reverting to the instance of cotton, mentioned above, it will be proper to hold that when raw cotton is delivered in State A for being ginned in that State., it is delivered for consumption in State A ; when ginned cotton is delivered in State B for being spun into yarn, it is delivered for consumption in State B ; when yarn is delivered in State C for being woven into cloth in that State, it is delivered for consumption in State C; when woven cloth is delivered in State D for being made by tailor in that State into wearing apparel, there is delivery of cloth for consumption in State D; and finally when, wearing apparel is delivered in State E for being sold as dress in that State, it is delivery of wearing apparel for con- sumption in State E. Except at the final stage of consumption which consists in using the finished commodity as an article of clothing, there will be noticed at each stage of production the bringing into existence of a commercial commodity different from what was received by the producers. This conversion of a commodity into a different commercial commodity by subjecting it to some processing, is consumption with. in the meaning of the Explanation to Art. 286 no less than the final act of user when no distinct commodity is being brought into existence but what was brought into existence is being used up. At one stage of the argument what Mr. Pathak appeared to insist was that there must be destruction of the substance of the thing before the thing can be said to be consumed. That takes us nowhere, because we have still to find out what is meant by destruction of the substance. It may well be said that when a commodity is converted into a commercially different commodity its former identity is destroyed and so there is destruction of the substance, to satisfy the test suggested by the learned counsel.

We are not aware of any case where such use of a commodity has been held not to amount to consumption.
It must therefore be held on the facts of this case that when tobacco was delivered in the-State of Bombay for the purpose of changing it into a commercially different article, viz., bidi patti the delivery was for the purpose of consumption. The purchases in this case therefore fall within the meaning of Explanation to Art. 286(1)(a) and must be held to have taken place inside the State of Bombay. There remains for consideration the objection that the transactions took place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce within the. meaning of Art. 286(2) of the Constitution and the levy of tax was therefore prohibited by the provisions thereof. Even if these transactions were in the course of inter-State trade, the bar of Art. 286(2) of the Constitution stands removed by the Sales Tax Laws Validation Act, for the entire period upto September 6, 1955. The levy of tax for the period September 7, 1955, to September 29, 1955, would be illegal if these transactions are in the course of inter-State trade. The petitioner's counsel however informed us that he did not want a decision on his question and would not, in this case, press his objection under Art. 286(2). It is unnecessary for us therefore to decide whether the transactions in question took place in the course of interState trade-or commerce within the meaning of Art. 286(2) of the Constitution. As the petitioner has failed to establish any, violation of its fundamental right, the petition is dismissed with costs.
