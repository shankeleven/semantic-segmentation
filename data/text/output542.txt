CIVIL APPFLLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 103 of 1952. Appeal under article 133(1) (c) of the Constitution of India- from the Judgment and Order, dated the 10th August, 1951, of the High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan at Jodhpur (Wanchoo and Bapna JJ.), in D. B. Civil Miscellaneous Application No. 21 of 1951. K. S. Hajela, Advocate-General of Rajasthan, for the appellant.
No appearance for the respondents.
1954. March 17. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by GHULAM HASAN J.-This appeal is brought under a certificate granted by the High Court of Rajasthan under article 133(c) of the Constitution of India against a judgment and order of that High Court in writ petition under article 226 holding the appointment of one Shri Sukhdeo Narain as invalid and directing that all proceedings taken by him as the Industrial Court under section 7 of the Industrial Disputes Act (No. XIV of 1947) are null and void.
We are informed that Shri Sukhdeo Narain has ceased to work as an Industrial Tribunal and the present appeal, therefore, becomes infructuous, but we are invited by the Advocate-General on behalf of the State of Rajasthan who is the appellant before us to decide the question as to the validity of the appointment, as it is likely to affect other awards made by tribunals under the Industrial Disputes Act. We accordingly proceed to give our decision. The question involved in the case is whether the appointment of Shri Sukhdeo Narain is invalid because he does not fulfil the qualifications laid down for a tribunal under section 7(3) of the Industrial Disputes Act. Section 7(3) hereinafter referred to as the Industrial Act says:-	Issue
The Industrial Act was applied to Rajasthan by the Rajasthan Adaptation of Central Laws Ordinance, 1950 (Ordinance IV of 1950), by the Rajpramukh on January 24, 1950. By this adaptation section 7 of the Industrial Act came to be applied to Rajasthan. Shri Sukhdeo Narain was appointed on October 9, 1950, by a notification which ran as follows:-	Facts
The appointment of Shri Sukhdeo Narain was objected to by the respondent on the ground that, the words "a Judge of a High Court" in section 7(3) mean " a Judge of the High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan established under the Rajasthan High Court Ordinance, 1949"
The High Court held that the word "Rajasthan" as defined in Ordinance I of 1949 means the United State of Rajasthan and "the Judges an d other officers" mentioned in section 5(ix) must be held to be those in the service of the United State of Rajasthan. Accordingly they held that Shri Sukhdeo Narain could not be held to be a District Judge within the meaning of section 7(3) (b) and his appointment as an Industrial Tribunal under that section was, therefore, invalid. We are of opinion that this appeal can be decided on a short ground. The Industrial Disputes (Appellate Tribunal) Act (XLVIII of 1950) came into force on May 20, 1950. By section 34 it was provided that the Industrial Disputes Act, XIV of 1947, shall be amended in the manner specified in the Schedule and the Schedule substituted sub-section (2) to section (1) of the Industrial Act as follows :-
(ix), stood amended or repealed but the High Court observed that even if this argument had been raised before them in appeal, it would have made no difference. It has been contended before us by Mr. Hajela, the learned Advocate- General on behalf of the State, that after the Industrial Disputes Act of 1947 was extended to Rajasthan by section 34 of the Industrial Disputes (Appellate Tribunal) Act, XLVIII of 1950, the provisions of the former stood amended by section 34 and could not be read subject to section 5 of the Rajasthan Adaptation of Central Laws Ordinance IV of 1950. We think there is force in this contention. The effect of section 34, as we have already indicated, was to extend the territorial application of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, to the whole of India including Rajasthan the exception being the State of Jammu and Kashmir only. This being so the words "A Judge of a High Court and a District Judge" used in section 7(3) (a) and (b) respectively of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, must be held now to include "A Judge of the High Court and a District Judge in the former State of Jodhpur". There is now no room for the application of section 5 of Ordinance IV of 1950 according to which a Judge of the High Court and a District Judge could only. mean a Judge of the High Court for Rajasthan established under the Rajasthan High Court Ordinance 1949 and a District Judge of or in Rajasthan within the meaning of section 5(ix) of Ordinance No. IV of 1950. Accordingly we hold that the appointment of Shri Sukhdeo Narain was perfectly valid.	Precedent
As we have already stated the appointment of Shri Sukhdeo Narain was made on October 9, 1950, i.e., after the Industrial Disputes Act had become applicable to Rajasthan. It is not necessary therefore to invoke the provisions of Ordinance.IV of 1950 in deciding the question of the validity of the appointment. The argument based on section 34 of Act XLVIII of 1950 was put forward before the High Court at the time of the hearing of the application for leave to appeal and it was contended that in view of section 34 the provisions of Rajasthan Adaptation of Central Laws Ordinance, 1950, namely section 5, subsections (vii) and	Section
We accordingly set aside the order of the High Court but without costs, as the respondent is not, represented. Agent for the appellant: R. H. Dhebar.	Conclusion
