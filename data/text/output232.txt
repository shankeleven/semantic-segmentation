The reference was made to the Bombay High Court by the Bombay Bench of the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal in the following circumstances.
We are concerned in this case with four policies of insurance with four different insurance companies.

This question was considered by the Supreme Court of Canada which decided that a receipt of this nature is not a "profit" and so is not taxable [B. C. Fir and Cedar Lumber Co. v. The King(1)]. But the Court did not examine the wider position whether it is "income" and in any event the decision was reversed appeal to the Privy Council(1). Their Lordships held it is "income". This was followed later by the Court of Appeal in England and endorsed by the House of Lords in Commissioners of inland Revenue v. William's Executors(1) In so far as these decisions do not turn the special wording of the Acts with which they are respectively concerned and deal -with the more general meaning of the word "income", we prefer the view taken in England.
read with reference to the particular facts of that case. The non-recurring aspect of this kind of receipt was considered by the Privy Council in The King v. B. C. Fir and Cedar Lumber Co.(1), and we do not think $their Lordships had in mind a case of this nature when they decided Shaw Wallace & Company's case (2).	Precedent
But the sting, so far as the assessee is concerned, lies in the words "not being receipts arising from business." The assessee is a business company. Its aim is to make profits and to insure against loss. In the ordinary way it does this by buying raw material, manufacturing goods out of them and selling them so that balance there is a profit or gain to itself. But it also has other ways of acquiring gain, as do all prudent businesses, namely by insuring against loss of profits. It is indubitable that the money paid in such circumstances is a receipt and in so far as it represents loss of profits, as opposed to loss of capital and so forth, it is an item of income in any normal sense of the term. It is equally clear that the receipt is in- separably connected with the ownership and conduct of the business and arises. from it. Accordingly, it is not exempt.	Section
It is true the Judicial Committee attempted a narrower definition in Commissioner of income-tax v. Shaw Wallace & Co.(1), by limiting income to "a periodical monetary return 'coming in' with some sort of regularity, or expected regularity, from definite sources" but, in our opinion, those remarks must be (I) [1931] Canada L.R. 435.

The learned Solicitor- General relies strongly a clause which appears in three of the four policies with which we are concerned. That is a clause which states that the insured must do all he can to minimise the loss in profits and until he makes an endeavour to re-start the business the moneys will not be paid. This, he argued, shows that the money was paid as an indemnity against the loss of profits and was niether income nor profits, nor was it a gain within the meaning of the section. We are unable to see how these receipts cease to be income simply because certain things must be done before the moneys can be claimed. In our opinion, the High Court was right in holding that the Rs. 14,00,000 is assessable to tax. The appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.
Appeal dismissed.

On the 18th of January, 1944, a fire. broke out and the mill were completely destroyed. The various insurance companies therefore paid the assessee company an aggregate of Rs. 14,00,000 account in the year with which we are concerned under these policies. This was paid in two sums as follows:-
