D. P. Joshi vs The State Of Madhya Bharat Andanother on 27 January, 1955	Case Title
ORIGINAL JURISDICTION-: Petition No. 367 of 1954. Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India for the enforcement of Fundamental Rights.
N. C. Chatterjee and Veda Vyas, (S. K. Kapur and Ganpat Rai, with them), for the petitioner.
M. C. Setalvad, Attorney-General of India (Shiv Dyal and P. G. -Gokhale, with him), for respondent No. 1.
VENKATARAMA AYYAR J.-This is a petition under article 32 of the Constitution. There is at Indore a Medical-College known as the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College run by the State of Madhya Bharat. The petitioner who is a resident of Delhi was admitted as a student of this College in July. 1952, and is now studying in the third year class, M.B.B.S. Course. His complaint is that the rules in force in this institution discriminate in the matter of fees bet- ween students who are residents of Madhya Bharat and those who are not, and that the latter have to pay in addition to the tuition fees and charges payable by all the students a sum of Rs. 1,500 per annum as capitation fee, and that this is in contravention of articles 14 and 15(1) of the Constitution. The petitioner accordingly prays that an appropriate writ might be issued prohibiting the respondent from collecting from him capitation fee for the current year, and directing a refund of Rs. 3,000 collected from him as capitation fee for the first two years.
The respondent contests the petition. In the affidavit filed on its behalf, it is stated that the institution in question had its origin in private enterprise, and was under

Issue
Now the contention of Mr. N. C. Chatterjee for the (1) I.L.R. 1953 Madhya Bharat 87, 99, petitioner is that this rule is in contravention of articles 14 and 15(1), and must therefore be struck down as unconstitutional and void. Article 15(1) enacts:	PetArg
It was also urged on behalf of the respondent that the word "domicile" in the rule might be construed not in its technical legal sense, but in a popular sense as meaning "residence", and the following passage in Wharton's Law Lexicon, 14th Edition, page 344 was quoted as supporting such a construction:
It is next contended for the petitioner that the imposition of capitation fee on some of the students and not on others is discriminatory, and is in contravention of Article 14 of the Constitution, and therefore void. The impugned rule divides, as already stated, Self-nominees into two groups, those who are bona fide residents of Madhya Bharat and those who are not, and while it imposes a capitation fee on the latter, it exempts the former from the payment thereof. It thus proceeds on a classification based on residence within the State, and the only point for decision is whether the ground of classification has a fair and substantial relation to the purpose of the law, or whether it is purely arbitrary and fanciful,, (1) I.L.R. 1953 Madhya Bharat 87, The object of the classification underlying the impugned rule was clearly to help to some extent students who are residents of Madhya Bharat in the prosecution of their studies, and it cannot be disputed that it is quite a legitimate and laudable objective for a State to encourage education within its borders. Education is a State subject, and one of the directive principles declared in Part IV of the Constitution is that the State should make effective provisions for education within the limits of its economy. (Vide article 41). The State has to contribute for the upkeep and the running of its educational institutions. We are in this petition concerned with a Medical College, and it is well-known that it requires considerable finance to maintain such an institution. If the State has to spend money on it, is it unreasonable that it should so order the educational system that the advantage of it would to some extent at least inure for the benefit of the State? A concession given to the residents of the State in the matter of fees is obviously calculated to serve that end, as presumably some of them might, after passing out of the College, settle down as doctors and serve the needs of the locality. The classification is thus based on a ground which has a reasonable relation to the subject-matter of the legislation, and is in consequence not open to attack. It has been held in The State of Punjab v. Ajaib Singh and another(1) that a classification might validly be made on a geographical basis. Such a classification would be eminently just and reasonable, where it relates to education which is the concern primarily of the State. The contention, therefore, that the rule imposing capitation fee is in contravention of article 14 must be rejected. We have proceeded so far on the assumption that the impugned rule is a "law" as defined in article 13. If it is not that, article 14 would have no application. It was indeed contended by the learned Attorney General on behalf of the respondent that the rule in question is a mere administrative or executive order, and that however liberally the word "law" might be (1) [1953] S.C.R. 254.	RespArg
1955. January 27. The judgment of Mukherjea C. J., Vivian Bose, Venkatarama Ayyar and Sinha JJ. was delivered by Venkatarama Ayyar J.Jagannadhadas J. delivered a separate judgment.
In brief, the change effected by the new rule was that whereas previously exemption from capitation fee was granted in favour of all Madhya Bharat students whatever that might mean, under the revised rule it was limited to bona fide residents of Madhya Bharat.
The argument of the petitioner is that the rule under challenge in so far as it imposes a capitation fee on students who do not belong to Madhya Bharat while providing an exemption therefrom to students of Madhya Bharat, makes a discrimination based on the place of birth, and that it offends article 15 (1). Whatever force there might have been in this contention if the question had arisen with reference to the rule as it stood when the State took over the administration, the rule was modified in 1952, and that is what we are concerned with in this petition. The rule as modified is clearly not open to attack as infringing article 15(1). The ground for exemption from payment of capitation fee as laid down therein is bona fide residence in the State of Madhya Bharat. Residence and place of birth are two distinct conceptions with different connotations both in law and in fact, and when article 15(1) prohibits discrimination based on the place of birth, it cannot be read as prohibiting discrimination based on residence. This is not seriously disputed. The argument that is pressed on us is that though the rule purports to grant. exemption based on residence within the State, the definition of bonafide residence under the rule shows that the exemption is really based on the place of birth. Considerable emphasis was laid on clauses (a) and (b) of the rule wherein 'residence' is defined in terms of domicile, and it was argued that the original domicile, as it is termed in the rules, could in substance mean only place of birth, and that therefore the exemption based on domicile was, in effect, an exemption based on place of birth under an alia8. That, however, is not the true legal position. Domicile of a person means his permanent home. "Domicile meant permanent home, and if that was not understood by itself no illustration could help to make it intelligible" observed Lord Cranworth in Whicker v. Hume(1). Domicile of origin of a person means "the domicile received by him at his birth". (Vide Dicey on Conflict of Laws, 6th Edition, page 87). The learned author then proceeds to observe at page 88:
In Somerville v. Somerville(2), Arden, Master of the Rolls, observed:
Mr. N. C. Chatterjee argued that domicile of origin was often called domicile of birth, and invited our attention to certain observations of Lord Macnaghten in Winans v. Attorney-General(1). But then, the noble Lord went on to add that the use of the words "domicile of birth" was perhaps not accurate. But that apart, what has to be noted is that whether the expression used is "domicile of origin"
domicile to his civil rights. A classic statement of the law on this subject is that of Lord Westbury in Udny v. Udny(1). He observes:
Dealing with this question Dicey says at page 94:
Vide also the observations of Lord Lindley in Winans v. Attorney-General(1). In Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol. VI the law is thus stated at page 198, para 242:
A more serious question is that as the law knows only of domicile of a country as a whole and not of any particular place therein, whether there can be such a thing as Madhya Bharat domicile apart from Indian domicile. To answer this question we must examine what the word "domicile" in law imports. When we speak of a person as having a domicile of a particular country, we mean that in certain matters such as succession minority and marriage he is governed by the law of that country. Domicile has reference to the system of law by which a person is governed, and when we speak of the domicile of a country, we assume that the same system of law prevails all over that country. But it might well happen that laws relating to succession and marriage might not be the same all over the country, and that different areas in the State might have different laws in respect of those matters. In that case, each area having a distinct set of laws would itself be regarded as a country for the purpose of domicile. The position is thus stated by Dicey at page 83:
The following statement of the law in Halsbury's Laws of England, Volume VI, page 246, para 249 may also be quoted:
(a) and (b) refer to domicile, and they occur as part of the definition of "bonafide resident". In Corpus Juris Secundum, Volume 28, page 5, it is stated:
There is therefore considerable force in the contention of the respondent that when the rule-making authorities referred to domicile in clauses (a) and (b) they were thinking really of residence. In this view also, the contention that the rule is repugnant to article 15(1) must fail.
It must be mentioned that the rule relating to the payment of capitation fee discussed above was again modified by the management as a result of the decision of the High Court of Madhya Bharat in Rustam Mody v. State: Sumitra Devi v. State(1). The rule as amended-and that is what is now in force-runs as follows:
Now, as has been pointed out in the majority judgment, the relevant original rule by the date when the College was taken over by the State from private management was that "Madhya Bharat students are exempted from capitation fees". On the State taking over the College, this rule was substituted by the following, new rule:
(1) [1859] 28 L.J. Ch. 396, 398.
Now confining our attention to the category (a) which has given rise to the main controversy in this case, it appears to me quite clear that the phrase '.original domicile in Madhya Bharat" used therein could not have been meant to indicate either the residence or the permanent home of the applicant in Madhya Bharat. What then is the meaning intended to be conveyed thereby. Is the word "domicile" in this phrase to be understood in the legalistic sense or as the likely framer of the relvant rule-possibly a lay man like the Director of Public Instruction of the State-would have understood it to mean. It is necessary for this purpose to have a clear idea of the concept of "domicile" and its applicability in relation to any particular region within a country like India. Now the jurists concept of domicile is one which can be best gathered from the following passage in the classic judgment of Lord Westbury in Udny v. Udny(1).
Thus domicile is that attribute of a person's status which according to International Law determines (1) [1869] L.R 1 Sc. & Div. 441, 457, the personal laws by which he is governed and on which his personal laws depend. The question for consideration is whether this concept of domicile can apply to the word "domicile" in the phrase "domicile in Madhya Bharat". Dicey in his Conflict of Laws (6th Edn.), at pages 43 and 78 says as follows:
In this connection it is to be remembered that the relevant rule is a substitute for the pre-existing rule which was as follows:
The phrase "Madhya Bharat students" has no reference either to residence or domicile, and there can be no doubt that it normally connoted students who were born in Madhya Bharat. In my opinion when the State authorities took over the management of the institution from private hands and made a change in the rule by coining a hybrid definition of the phrase "bona fide residents of Madhya Bharat" placing the category of citizens whose original domicile is in Madhya Bharat in the forefront of that definition, they only attempted to camouflage the implication thereof so as to accord with the pre-existing rule, viz. that the benefits of the exemption from capitation fees should be available only to persons born in Madhya Bharat and the burden of the capitation fees should be borne by persons not born in Madhya Bharat. In the view I take of the real meaning and effect of the rule, which is under discussion, neither an attempt at subsequent clarification nor the actual manner in which it is said to be administered or intended to be administered, as stated by the Assistant Secretary to the Madhya Bharat Government,, Shri H. L. Gupta, in his affidavit, even if accepted as correct, can have any bearing. The fact that some of the admitted students of the Medical College who are residents of Madhya Bharat may not be entitled to exemption from capitation fee under the rule as now sought to be interpreted is not relevant so long as a student in the position of the applicant cannot have the benefit of the exemption, even if he got the highest marks in the competi- tion. In my view, therefore, the rule in question has reference to place of birth in Madhya Bharat primarily, though a number of other miscellaneous categories might also come in under other and different heads. Hence the rule offends article 15 of the Constitution. Even in the view that the rule has reference to the juristic concept of regional domicil and for that reason does not fall within the scope of the inhibition of article 15, 1 am unable to see how, with reference to article 14, the distinction based on such domicile can be considered reasonable. No sugges- tion has been put forward how "original domicile in Madhya Bharat" is a reasonable ground for classification. In my opinion, therefore, the primary content of the rule relating to capitation fees which is contained in clause (a) of the definition of "bona fide resident of Madhya Bharat" does operate to the disadvantage of the petitioner by way of unconstitutional discrimination. Hence the State Government cannot validly seek to levy capitation fees on the petitioner with reference to that rule.	Precedent
(a) to (c) rest on a classification based on domicile and residence, and are (1) [1889] 14 A.C. 631, distinct and severable from clause (d), they would be valid even if clause (d) were to be held bad.
institution and the relevant rules have been set out in the judgment of the majority just delivered and it is unnecessary to repeat them. It is desirable, however, to mention, at the outset two matters. The exact authority for these rules, that is to say, the question whether they are rules made under a rule-making power having a legislative basis, or whether they are merely executive orders, which it is open to the State Government to change as they please, has not been clearly elucidated. Though the learned Attorney General suggested, in -the course of his arguments, that these were merely executive orders and that as such they did not come within the scope of article 14 of the Constitution, the material placed before us throws no light thereon. Nor has the question as to whether these executive orders which are issued by the State and are general in their application within the ambit of their subject matter constitute laws falling with in the scope of article 14, been sufficiently canvassed before us. The discussion has proceeded on the assumption that the validity of these rules may be judged with reference both to the article 14 and article 15, no other article obviously having any direct bearing.
This, it is said, was the rule in force when the applicant was admitted into the College. This rule is again said to have been modified recently and the same is as follows:	Section
construed, it should be limited to what is an expression of the legislative power and cannot comprehend what is an executive order. In support of this contention he relied on the decision in Om Prakash v. The State(1). In the view which we have taken that even on the footing that it is a law, the rule does not offend article 14, we do not consider it necessary to express any opinion on this question. One other contention put forward by the respondent remains to be noticed. It was urged that as the institution was originally under private management and the State took it over subject to the conditions under which it was run, it was bound to enforce the rule relating to the payment of capitation fee which was previously in operation. But the terms under which the State took over expressly reserve only the agreement for reserving seats for the nominees of participating States and donors, and do not contain any undertaking to maintain the rule relating to imposition of capitation fee. Whether if such an undertaking had been given it could have been set up in answer to a fundamental right, does not therefore arise for decision. In the result, the petition fails and is dismissed; but in the circumstances there will be no order as to costs. JAGANNADHADAS J.-I regret that I feel obliged to differ. The question that arises is whether the petitioner who is a resident of Delhi and has been admitted in July, 1952, by the State of Madhya Bharat as a student in the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College at Indore and who has been called upon to pay a sum of Rs. 1,500 per annum as capitation fee, in addition to the tuition fees and other charges payable by all the students of the college in general, is entitled to a writ restraining the authorities concerned from levying that capitation fee on the ground that the rule under which be is asked to pay is repugnant to the Constitution. The history of the (1) A.I.R. 1953 Punjab 93.
(c) of article 5 of the Constitution with "domicile of Madhya Bharat" substituted for "domicile of India" and this raises the question of the concept of regional domicile (tending to the growth of the idea of regional citizenship) which will be discussed presently.
I have already given my reasons for thinking that the meaning of "residence" or "permanent home" of the applicant cannot be read into the phrase "domicile in Madhya Bharat"
I would, therefore, allow this application.
By COURT.-In accordance with the opinion of the majority, the Petition is dismissed without costs.
Petition dismissed.	Conclusion

VENKATARAMA AYYAR J.-This is a petition under article 32 of the Constitution. There is at Indore a Medical-College known as the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College run by the State of Madhya Bharat. The petitioner who is a resident of Delhi was admitted as a student of this College in July. 1952, and is now studying in the third year class, M.B.B.S. Course. His complaint is that the rules in force in this institution discriminate in the matter of fees bet- ween students who are residents of Madhya Bharat and those who are not, and that the latter have to pay in addition to the tuition fees and charges payable by all the students a sum of Rs. 1,500 per annum as capitation fee, and that this is in contravention of articles 14 and 15(1) of the Constitution. The petitioner accordingly prays that an appropriate writ might be issued prohibiting the respondent from collecting from him capitation fee for the current year, and directing a refund of Rs. 3,000 collected from him as capitation fee for the first two years.
The respondent contests the petition. In the affidavit filed on its behalf, it is stated that the institution in question had its origin in private enterprise, and was under
In brief, the change effected by the new rule was that whereas previously exemption from capitation fee was granted in favour of all Madhya Bharat students whatever that might mean, under the revised rule it was limited to bona fide residents of Madhya Bharat.
Now the contention of Mr. N. C. Chatterjee for the (1) I.L.R. 1953 Madhya Bharat 87, 99, petitioner is that this rule is in contravention of articles 14 and 15(1), and must therefore be struck down as unconstitutional and void. Article 15(1) enacts:
The argument of the petitioner is that the rule under challenge in so far as it imposes a capitation fee on students who do not belong to Madhya Bharat while providing an exemption therefrom to students of Madhya Bharat, makes a discrimination based on the place of birth, and that it offends article 15 (1). Whatever force there might have been in this contention if the question had arisen with reference to the rule as it stood when the State took over the administration, the rule was modified in 1952, and that is what we are concerned with in this petition. The rule as modified is clearly not open to attack as infringing article 15(1). The ground for exemption from payment of capitation fee as laid down therein is bona fide residence in the State of Madhya Bharat. Residence and place of birth are two distinct conceptions with different connotations both in law and in fact, and when article 15(1) prohibits discrimination based on the place of birth, it cannot be read as prohibiting discrimination based on residence. This is not seriously disputed. The argument that is pressed on us is that though the rule purports to grant. exemption based on residence within the State, the definition of bonafide residence under the rule shows that the exemption is really based on the place of birth. Considerable emphasis was laid on clauses (a) and (b) of the rule wherein 'residence' is defined in terms of domicile, and it was argued that the original domicile, as it is termed in the rules, could in substance mean only place of birth, and that therefore the exemption based on domicile was, in effect, an exemption based on place of birth under an alia8. That, however, is not the true legal position. Domicile of a person means his permanent home. "Domicile meant permanent home, and if that was not understood by itself no illustration could help to make it intelligible" observed Lord Cranworth in Whicker v. Hume(1). Domicile of origin of a person means "the domicile received by him at his birth". (Vide Dicey on Conflict of Laws, 6th Edition, page 87). The learned author then proceeds to observe at page 88:
In Somerville v. Somerville(2), Arden, Master of the Rolls, observed:

Dealing with this question Dicey says at page 94:
Vide also the observations of Lord Lindley in Winans v. Attorney-General(1). In Halsbury's Laws of England, Vol. VI the law is thus stated at page 198, para 242:
tion of the civilised world in civil societies, each of which consists of all those persons who live in any territorial area which is subject to one system of law, and not its Organization in political societies or States, ,each of which may either be co-extensive with a single legal system or may unite several systems under its own sovereignty".
Under the Constitution, article 5, which defines citi- zenship, itself proceeds on the basis that it is different from domicile, because under that article, domicile is not by itself sufficient to confer on a person the status of a citizen of this country.
A more serious question is that as the law knows only of domicile of a country as a whole and not of any particular place therein, whether there can be such a thing as Madhya Bharat domicile apart from Indian domicile. To answer this question we must examine what the word "domicile" in law imports. When we speak of a person as having a domicile of a particular country, we mean that in certain matters such as succession minority and marriage he is governed by the law of that country. Domicile has reference to the system of law by which a person is governed, and when we speak of the domicile of a country, we assume that the same system of law prevails all over that country. But it might well happen that laws relating to succession and marriage might not be the same all over the country, and that different areas in the State might have different laws in respect of those matters. In that case, each area having a distinct set of laws would itself be regarded as a country for the purpose of domicile. The position is thus stated by Dicey at page 83:
The following statement of the law in Halsbury's Laws of England, Volume VI, page 246, para 249 may also be quoted:
whether during the time the custom and the restraint of disposing by testament were in full force, a gentleman of the county of York coming to London for the winter and dying there intestate, the disposition of his personal estate should be according to the custom or the general law". The principle that was laid down was that "succession to the personal estate of an intestate is to be regulated by the law of the country, in which be was a domiciled inhabitant at the time of his death; without any regard whatsoever to the place either of the birth or the death or the situation of the property at that time". On the facts, the decision was that the domicile of origin which was Scotch, governed the succession. What is of interest in this decision is that it recognizes that for purposes of succession there can be within one political unit, as many domiciles as there are systems of law, and that there can be a Scotch domicile, an English domicile and even a York domicile within Great Britain.
Under the Constitution, the power to legislate on succession, marriage and minority has been conferred under Entry 5 in the Concurrent List on both the Union and the State Legislatures, and it is therefore quite conceivable that until the Centre intervenes and enacts a uniform code for the whole of India, each State might have its own laws on those subjects, and thus there could be different domiciles for different States. We do not, therefore, see any force in the contention that there cannot be a domicile of Madhya Bharat under the Constitution.
It was also urged on behalf of the respondent that the word "domicile" in the rule might be construed not in its technical legal sense, but in a popular sense as meaning "residence", and the following passage in Wharton's Law Lexicon, 14th Edition, page 344 was quoted as supporting such a construction:
What has to be considered is whether in the present context "domicile" was used in the sense of residence. The rule requiring the payment of a capitation fee and providing for exemption therefrom refers only to bona fide residents within the State. There is no reference to domicile in the rule itself, but in the Explanation which follows, clauses
(a) and (b) refer to domicile, and they occur as part of the definition of "bonafide resident". In Corpus Juris Secundum, Volume 28, page 5, it is stated:
There is therefore considerable force in the contention of the respondent that when the rule-making authorities referred to domicile in clauses (a) and (b) they were thinking really of residence. In this view also, the contention that the rule is repugnant to article 15(1) must fail.
There was a good deal of argument before us on the validity of clause (d) of the rule. It was contended by the petitioner that clause introduced a new element unconnected with domicile or residence which formed the basis of the previous clause, that it put foreign nationals on a more advantageous footing than Indian citizens, and that the entire rule must be discarded as based on no rational or intelligible principle. No doubt, clause (d) strikes a new note. And it may be that as a matter of policy the management of the institution decided that it would be an advantage to associate citizens of other countries with Indian citizens in educational institutions, and therefore reserved a few seats for them on the most-favoured nation treatment basis. The validity of this reservation, however, does not arise for decision in this petition, and as clauses
(a) to (c) rest on a classification based on domicile and residence, and are (1) [1889] 14 A.C. 631, distinct and severable from clause (d), they would be valid even if clause (d) were to be held bad.
It must be mentioned that the rule relating to the payment of capitation fee discussed above was again modified by the management as a result of the decision of the High Court of Madhya Bharat in Rustam Mody v. State: Sumitra Devi v. State(1). The rule as amended-and that is what is now in force-runs as follows:
Under this rule also, the exemption is in favour of bona fide residents of Madhya Bharat", and therefore with reference to the points now under consideration, the position under the present rule would appear to be the same as under the previous one. It is unnecessary to consider this matter further, as learned counsel on either side were agreed that the rights of the petitioner must be determined in accordance with the rule which was in force when he was admitted.
It is next contended for the petitioner that the imposition of capitation fee on some of the students and not on others is discriminatory, and is in contravention of Article 14 of the Constitution, and therefore void. The impugned rule divides, as already stated, Self-nominees into two groups, those who are bona fide residents of Madhya Bharat and those who are not, and while it imposes a capitation fee on the latter, it exempts the former from the payment thereof. It thus proceeds on a classification based on residence within the State, and the only point for decision is whether the ground of classification has a fair and substantial relation to the purpose of the law, or whether it is purely arbitrary and fanciful,, (1) I.L.R. 1953 Madhya Bharat 87, The object of the classification underlying the impugned rule was clearly to help to some extent students who are residents of Madhya Bharat in the prosecution of their studies, and it cannot be disputed that it is quite a legitimate and laudable objective for a State to encourage education within its borders. Education is a State subject, and one of the directive principles declared in Part IV of the Constitution is that the State should make effective provisions for education within the limits of its economy. (Vide article 41). The State has to contribute for the upkeep and the running of its educational institutions. We are in this petition concerned with a Medical College, and it is well-known that it requires considerable finance to maintain such an institution. If the State has to spend money on it, is it unreasonable that it should so order the educational system that the advantage of it would to some extent at least inure for the benefit of the State? A concession given to the residents of the State in the matter of fees is obviously calculated to serve that end, as presumably some of them might, after passing out of the College, settle down as doctors and serve the needs of the locality. The classification is thus based on a ground which has a reasonable relation to the subject-matter of the legislation, and is in consequence not open to attack. It has been held in The State of Punjab v. Ajaib Singh and another(1) that a classification might validly be made on a geographical basis. Such a classification would be eminently just and reasonable, where it relates to education which is the concern primarily of the State. The contention, therefore, that the rule imposing capitation fee is in contravention of article 14 must be rejected. We have proceeded so far on the assumption that the impugned rule is a "law" as defined in article 13. If it is not that, article 14 would have no application. It was indeed contended by the learned Attorney General on behalf of the respondent that the rule in question is a mere administrative or executive order, and that however liberally the word "law" might be (1) [1953] S.C.R. 254.

In support of this contention he relied on the decision in Om Prakash v. The State(1). In the view which we have taken that even on the footing that it is a law, the rule does not offend article 14, we do not consider it necessary to express any opinion on this question.

The history of the (1) A.I.R. 1953 Punjab 93.
institution and the relevant rules have been set out in the judgment of the majority just delivered and it is unnecessary to repeat them. It is desirable, however, to mention, at the outset two matters. The exact authority for these rules, that is to say, the question whether they are rules made under a rule-making power having a legislative basis, or whether they are merely executive orders, which it is open to the State Government to change as they please, has not been clearly elucidated. Though the learned Attorney General suggested, in -the course of his arguments, that these were merely executive orders and that as such they did not come within the scope of article 14 of the Constitution, the material placed before us throws no light thereon. Nor has the question as to whether these executive orders which are issued by the State and are general in their application within the ambit of their subject matter constitute laws falling with in the scope of article 14, been sufficiently canvassed before us. The discussion has proceeded on the assumption that the validity of these rules may be judged with reference both to the article 14 and article 15, no other article obviously having any direct bearing.
Now, as has been pointed out in the majority judgment, the relevant original rule by the date when the College was taken over by the State from private management was that "Madhya Bharat students are exempted from capitation fees". On the State taking over the College, this rule was substituted by the following, new rule:
This, it is said, was the rule in force when the applicant was admitted into the College. This rule is again said to have been modified recently and the same is as follows:
In the affidavit filed in this Court by Shri H. L. Gupta, Assistant Secretary to the Government of Madhya Bharat, it is stated that this was meant to be only a restatement by the Government of their real intention in order to clarify what the prior rule was meant to convey. Now, with reference to these rules, it is necessary to notice the suggestion made in the course of the argument that the rules by the use of the word "exemption" indicate that some students get the benefit of not paying what would otherwise have been payable and that therefore others cannot complain of any hostile action constituting discrimination. But a copy of the rules for admission to the regular M.B.B.S. courses (copied from Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College, Indore, Calendar of 1954) with which we have been furnished as one of the enclosures to the affidavit of the petitioner, and which is at pages 34 to 38 of the paper-book, on a perusal thereof, clearly shows at page 37 that the capitation fee is in addition to the normal fees and that this is payable only in respect of some students, while all the students in general pay certain prescribed fees. But whether the rule is in the nature of an exemption for some students or is by way of an addition for the others, there is clearly discrimination between the two groups which affects the one adversely. The very use of the phrase "capitation fees" for this additional amount levied from some, is indicative of its discriminatory character. The only question accordingly is whether this discrimination falls within the mischief of either article 14 or article 15. It is desirable for this purpose to have a clear understanding of what exactly the relevant rule at the date of the admission of the applicant into the College signifies.
It has been stated that this rule has to be understood with reference to the allocation scheme for admission of students which is said to be as follows in the affidavit of Shri H. L. Gupta, Assistant Secretary to the Government of Madhya Bharat.
It has been stated by the applicant in his reply affidavit that, while the competitive examination is the same for all, it is only the marks of the candidates in each separate group that are taken into consideration inter se. However this may be, there appear to be, as stated by the Assistant Secretary to the Madhya Bharat Government, three broad categories: (1) A certain number of seats reserved for "bona fide students of Madhya Bharat". (2) A certain number of seats reserved for some specified States and the original donors, who in respect of their nominees have to pay capitation fees, somewhat lower in amount, and (3) The rest of the students who have to pay the higher capitation fees. The second category above mentioned may be left out of consideration for the present case, since that depends on certain pre- existing contractual obligations and different considera- tions may arise and the present petitioner does not fall within this category. The question of discrimination in this case arises really with reference to categories I and 3 above and turns upon the exact meaning of the phrase "bonafide, residents" as defined in the rules. If this definition was meant to convey fairly andsubstantially, the qualification of residence in Madhya Bharat and nothing else, it may be, that this is not hit. by article 15 and that it may also be a reasonable classification, on the facts and circumstances of a particular State, for purposes
-of article 14. The learned Attorney-General himself based his arguments, at one stage, on this view of the definition of "bona fide resident" in the rules. But the difficulty is that the learned Attorney-General has not committed himself, on behalf of the State, as to this being the only reasonable meaning of the definition. He put it as a kind of alternative. The Assistant Secretary to the Madhya Bharat Government, Shri H. L. Gupta, in his affidavit clearly and categorically says that the charging of capitation fee, truly speaking, is not on the basis of residence. The restatement of the rule by the Government is not also definite or clear about it inasmuch as it uses again the phrase "bona fide residents of Madhya Bharat". Bona fide residents of Madhya Bharat, as defined, is clearly something quite different from the class which can be designated ordi- narily as "residents of Madhya Bharat". Now out of the four categories comprised in the definition, obviously (c) and
(d) have absolutely nothing to do with actual residence. It is also difficult to discover any principle with reference to which discrimination can be justified in favour of (1) a Pakistani migrant with the mere intention to make Madhya Bharat his permanent residence, and (2) a person, belonging to the contiguous areas of Madhya Bharat, or the contiguous areas of India (and excluding citizens of India from the non-contiguous areas of Madhya Bharat, like the applicant). The main categories, however, are those which fall within (a) and (b) of the definition. But it is difficult to say even of these categories that they are based merely on residence, as such., of the person concerned. Category (b) has reference to "Domicile in Madhya Bharat" plus residence in Madhya Bharat for the preceding five years. Category (a) has reference only to "original domicile in Madhya Bharat" and by contrast with category (b) which requires precedent residence, is clearly intended not to insist on any precedent residence. Even if it be assumed that "domicile" means "permanent home" as stated by Lord Cranston in Whicker v. Hume(1) this has no necessary reference to the appli- cant's actual residence at the relevant time. It is difficult to see why the fact of the applicant's father having had his permanent home in Madhya Bharat at the time of applicant's birth should be a ground of preference or why a person who has made Madhya Bharat his permanent home but left it for a time and returned only, say, an year previously should be denied it. Thus the definition of "bona fide resident" taken as a whole or even confining it to categories (a), (b) and (c) cannot be said to be based merely on residence in Madhya Bharat. Nor can any intelligible basis of grouping be gathered therefrom by imputing to the word "domicile" the meaning "residence" or (.permanent home". It is interesting to notice, in this connection, that category (b) in requiring Madhya Bharat domicile and precedent residence for five years follows closely the pattern of Indian citizenship based on category
(c) of article 5 of the Constitution with "domicile of Madhya Bharat" substituted for "domicile of India" and this raises the question of the concept of regional domicile (tending to the growth of the idea of regional citizenship) which will be discussed presently.
(1) [1859] 28 L.J. Ch. 396, 398.
Now confining our attention to the category (a) which has given rise to the main controversy in this case, it appears to me quite clear that the phrase '.original domicile in Madhya Bharat" used therein could not have been meant to indicate either the residence or the permanent home of the applicant in Madhya Bharat. What then is the meaning intended to be conveyed thereby. Is the word "domicile" in this phrase to be understood in the legalistic sense or as the likely framer of the relvant rule-possibly a lay man like the Director of Public Instruction of the State-would have understood it to mean. It is necessary for this purpose to have a clear idea of the concept of "domicile" and its applicability in relation to any particular region within a country like India. Now the jurists concept of domicile is one which can be best gathered from the following passage in the classic judgment of Lord Westbury in Udny v. Udny(1).
Thus domicile is that attribute of a person's status which according to International Law determines (1) [1869] L.R 1 Sc. & Div. 441, 457, the personal laws by which he is governed and on which his personal laws depend. The question for consideration is whether this concept of domicile can apply to the word "domicile" in the phrase "domicile in Madhya Bharat". Dicey in his Conflict of Laws (6th Edn.), at pages 43 and 78 says as follows:
In respect of some of these matters as well as in respect of other matters which properly fall within the category of personal laws such as for instance minority, succession, etc., there have been legislative modifications. But it is noteworthy that those modifications are almost entirely of an all-India character and not on anv regional basis (viz. Indian Majority Act, Indian Succession Act). So far as I am aware there are only a few instances of Provincial or State legislation on any matters relating to personal laws and that too, to an extremely small and limited extent. Thus it will be seen that the Province or the State of India to which a Hindu or Muslim belongs has no relevance or relation to his personal laws. Indeed, the contrary is emphasised by the fact that, a Hindu at any rate, carries with. him even his own school of Hindu law in spite of migration to a different Province or State. Now, so far as Indian citizens who are neither Hindus nor Muslims are concerned, such as, Indian Christians or Anglo-Indians, they are governed by personal laws which are all-India %in character and not regional, as for instance the Indian Succession Act. (It may be mentioned that even in Europe until the middle ages, personal laws depended on race and not on domicile. See Philippine on International Law, page 36). In this state of the factual situation as regards the personal laws of the various categories of persons who comprise the bulk of the population of India, it appears to me to be clear that there has been in India up to the present moment no scope for growth of any concept of State or Provincial domicile as distinct from Indian domicile. There is thus no place for regional domicile, in the existing Indian law. Nor is there any reason to think that such a situation will arise in the future under the present Constitution. For this purpose, it may be noticed that the exclusive legislative power of the State does not extend to personal laws. Personal laws are the subject matter of item No. 5 of the Concurrent Legislative List. It is relevant in this connection also to notice that article 44 of the Constitution enjoins that "the State shall endeavour to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India". It is extremely unlikely therefore that regional personal laws will be, allowed to become operative in any substantial measure. It may be also mentioned that there is single citizenship under the Constitution for the whole of India and that "citizenship and naturalisation" have been listed within the exclusive competence of the Union Legislature. Of course citizenship is different from domicile. But I mention this here only to emphasize the view, that consistently with the Constitution, the concept of regional domicile which does not exist at the present day and which if recognised would tend to the growth of claims of regional citizenship (as for instance in the United States of America) would be entirely foreign to the intendment of the Constitution. It is with reference to the above considerations that the phrase "domicile in Madhya Bharat" in the relevant rule defining the phrase "bona fide resident of Madhya Bharat" has to be considered and understood. Since the concept of domicile in Madhya Bharat, is, in my view, unknown to the existing Indian law, I do not think it permissible to construe the phrase "domicile in Madhya Bharat" used in the relevant rule as having anything to do with the regional domicile of the kind known to the English system of law. The recognition of such a concept of regional domicile in English or American law does not necessitate that we should import the same idea into our country contrary to the intendment of the Constitution. We have got to consider the meaning of the phrase "original domicile in Madhya Bharat" used in the relevant rule with reference to the existing state of law in India, which, I conceive, does not recognise such a regional domicile.
I have already given my reasons for thinking that the meaning of "residence" or "permanent home" of the applicant cannot be read into the phrase "domicile in Madhya Bharat"
In this connection it is to be remembered that the relevant rule is a substitute for the pre-existing rule which was as follows:
The phrase "Madhya Bharat students" has no reference either to residence or domicile, and there can be no doubt that it normally connoted students who were born in Madhya Bharat. In my opinion when the State authorities took over the management of the institution from private hands and made a change in the rule by coining a hybrid definition of the phrase "bona fide residents of Madhya Bharat" placing the category of citizens whose original domicile is in Madhya Bharat in the forefront of that definition, they only attempted to camouflage the implication thereof so as to accord with the pre-existing rule, viz. that the benefits of the exemption from capitation fees should be available only to persons born in Madhya Bharat and the burden of the capitation fees should be borne by persons not born in Madhya Bharat. In the view I take of the real meaning and effect of the rule, which is under discussion, neither an attempt at subsequent clarification nor the actual manner in which it is said to be administered or intended to be administered, as stated by the Assistant Secretary to the Madhya Bharat Government,, Shri H. L. Gupta, in his affidavit, even if accepted as correct, can have any bearing. The fact that some of the admitted students of the Medical College who are residents of Madhya Bharat may not be entitled to exemption from capitation fee under the rule as now sought to be interpreted is not relevant so long as a student in the position of the applicant cannot have the benefit of the exemption, even if he got the highest marks in the competi- tion. In my view, therefore, the rule in question has reference to place of birth in Madhya Bharat primarily, though a number of other miscellaneous categories might also come in under other and different heads. Hence the rule offends article 15 of the Constitution. Even in the view that the rule has reference to the juristic concept of regional domicil and for that reason does not fall within the scope of the inhibition of article 15, 1 am unable to see how, with reference to article 14, the distinction based on such domicile can be considered reasonable. No sugges- tion has been put forward how "original domicile in Madhya Bharat" is a reasonable ground for classification. In my opinion, therefore, the primary content of the rule relating to capitation fees which is contained in clause (a) of the definition of "bona fide resident of Madhya Bharat" does operate to the disadvantage of the petitioner by way of unconstitutional discrimination. Hence the State Government cannot validly seek to levy capitation fees on the petitioner with reference to that rule.
I would, therefore, allow this application.
I think it right to add that the question as to the existence or admissibility of the concept of regional domicile as distinguished from Indian domicile and as to the bearing of this on the meaning of the concerned. rule were not canvassed or suggested at the hearing A before us and that the Court has not bad the benefit of arguments on these and the connected matters. if, therefore, I have ventured to differ, notwithstanding my respect for the views of the majority and notwithstanding the absence of assistance from the Bar, it is out of the conviction that the recognition, express or implied, of regional domicile by a decision of this Court would be contrary to the intendment of the Constitution.
By COURT.-In accordance with the opinion of the majority, the Petition is dismissed without costs.
Petition dismissed.	Total Judgement
