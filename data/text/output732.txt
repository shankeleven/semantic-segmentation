Burn & Co., Calcutta vs Their Employees(And Connected Appeal) on 11 October, 1956	Case Title
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeals Nos. 325 of 1955 and 174 of 1956.
Appeal by special leave from the decision and order dated the 29th April 1955 of the Labour Appellate Tribunal of India at Calcutta in Appeal No. Calcutta-110 of 1953 arising out of the award dated 24th June, 1953, of the Industrial Tribunal, Calcutta.
M. C. Setalvad, Attorney-General for India, B. Sen, S. N. Mukherji and B. N. Ghosh for M/s. Burn & Co.
N. C. Chatterji, A. K. Dutt and B. P. Maheshwari for the workmen.
We agree that an order refusing reinstatement would be open to appeal under section 7(1)(a) if it involved a substantial question of law. Whether a decision of the Appellate Tribunal that an appeal to it from an award was competent under section 7 (1) (a) on the ground that it involved a substantial question of law is final and not open to question in a civil court is a point on which we do not desire to express an opinion, as in the present case, the correctness of that ,decision is challenged not collaterally or in independent proceedings, such as an application under article 226 of the Constitution as in the two cases relied on for the respondent, but by way of appeal under article 136, and it is open to us to consider as a Court of Appeal whether, in fact, the order of the Tribunal was vitiated by an error of law, and whether the (1) [1956] 60 C.W.N. 602. 104 (2) A.I.R. 1956 All. 491, order of the Appellate Tribunal modifying it is sound. We must now consider the case of the four employees from this standpoint:	Issue
1956. October 11. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMA AYYAR J.--.Disputes having arisen between Messrs Burn and Company, Calcutta, hereinafter called the Company, and a section of their employees in Howrah Iron Works, hereinafter referred to as the Union, the Government of West Bengal issued a notification on 16-12-1952 referring the same to the First Industrial Tribunal for adjudication. Though there were as many as 13 items comprised in the reference, we are concerned in these appeals only with four of them, viz., (1) revision of pay of clerical and sub- staff, (2) grades of sarkars and checkers, (3) bonus and (4) reinstatement of four employees, S. N. Chatterjee, Ashimananda Banerjee, Panchanan Rana and Joydeb Banerjee and/or payment of compensation-to them. By his award dated 24-6-1953, Shri Banerji, the Industrial Tribunal, held (1) that there were no grounds for revising the scale of pay of the clerical and sub-staff; (2) that the pay of checkers should be increased and that they should be paid according to the scale as set out in his award; (3) that the profits of the Company did not warrant the grant of any bonus in addition to what had been paid by the Company; and (4) that of the four employees, Shambunath Chatterjee should be re- employed as a checker on his old pay, that Ashimananda Banerjee and Panchanan Rana should be "re-employed in posts equivalent to their own posts as new incumbents" and that Joydeb Banerjee was not entitled either to reinstatement or compensation.
Against this award, the Union preferred an appeal to the Labour Appellate Tribunal. By its decision dated 29-4-1955 the Appellate Tribunal substantially modified the award of Shri Banerji in favour of the Union it held (1) that the minimum pay of the clerical and sub-staff should be raised, and that corresponding changes should be made in the ceiling level, in the increments and in the scales of pay of other grades of the staff; (2) that the scale of pay of the sarkars and checkers should be increased and incre-
(2) The second question relates to the grading of sarkars and checkers. The claim put forward on their behalf is that they should be raised to the category of clerks. This was rejected by Shri Palit in his award dated 12-6-1950 and again by Shri Banerji in those proceedings. The Appellate Tribunal before whom this claim was repeated, while observing that the work of sarkars and checkers was "not of the same nature as that of the members of the clerical staff", held, nevertheless, that the scales of pay fixed in the award of the Engineering Tribunal for clerks should be applied to them, and that therefore non-matriculate sarkars and checkers should be put on Rs. 55-2 1/2-80 scale and matriculate sarkars and checkers on Rs. 60-2 1/2-90 scale. We are unable to uphold this order. When once the Appellate Tribunal reached the conclusion that the sarkars and checkers could not be put in the same category as clerks, the question then is simply whether any grounds had been made out for interfering with the fixation of pay scales by Shri Banerji. So far as the sarkars are concerned, the scale had been fixed by Shri Palit, and Shri Banerji adopted it. As no change' in the circumstances was alleged in support of a revision thereof, there was no ground for interfering with it. As for checkers, they are hourly rated workers, and Shri Banerji had revised their pay scale. Apart from stating that "the ends of justice"
(4) The question as regards Joydeb Banerjee is whether he is entitled to compensation on the ground that he had been wrongly discharged. The facts are that on 16-11-1950 a number of employees participated in an assault on the Works Manager, Mr. Davison, and the Company dismissed fourteen of them on that ground, and Joydeb Banerjee was one of them. The Appellate Tribunal has held that as no charge was, framed against him or an enquiry held, his dismissal was in contravention of the rules of natural justice. It has accordingly ordered that he should be given one year's basic wages with dearness allowance as compensation. It is true that no charge-sheet was formally drawn up against him, but that would not vitiate the order of dismissal if he knew what the charge against him was and had an opportunity of giving his explanation. It appears from the order of the Tribunal that subsequent to the order of dismissal by the Company, there were conciliation proceedings and an enquiry by the Labour Minister, as a result of which he recommended the reinstatement of seven out of the fourteen who had been dismissed, leaving the order in operation as regards the other seven, of whom Joydeb Banerjee was one. In the face of these facts, it is idle for him to contend that he had been dismissed without hearing or enquiry. The order of the Appellate Tribunal awarding compensation to him should be set aside.	Facts
ments given as laid down in the award; (3) that the employees should be paid a month's bonus in addition to what had been given to them; and (4) that of the employees, Shambunath Chatterjee, Ashimananda Banerjee and Panchanan Rana should not merely be re-employed but reinstated with continuity of service, and that further Shambunath Chatterjee was entitled to compensation at the rate of six months' basic wages with dearness allowance. As for Joydeb Banerjee, the Appellate Tribunal held that though his reinstatement was not desirable, he was entitled to one year's basic wages with dearness allowance as compensation. Against this decision, the Company has preferred Civil Appeal No. 325 of 1955 by special leave, and the Union has likewise preferred Civil Appeal No. 174 of 1956, the leave being limited in the latter to the four points raised by the Company in its appeal.	PetArg
But it is argued for the respondent that an award of the Tribunal refusing reinstatement would be appealable under section 7 (1) (a') if it involved a substantial question of law, and that as the contention of the employees was that the orders dismissing them were bad as having been passed in contravention of ,the rules of natural justice, that was a question of law on which an appeal was competent. It was further contended that when a question arises whether a Tribunal has jurisdiction over the subject-matter, it must be competent to decide whether the preliminary conditions exist, on which its jurisdiction depends, and its decision on that question is not liable to be attacked in civil courts, and that accordingly the assumption of jurisdiction by the Appellate Tribunal on the footing that there was a substantial question of law was not liable to be questioned by the civil court, and the decisions in Pankaj Kumar Ganguli v. Bank of India(3) and Upper Ganges Electric Employees Union v. Upper Ganges Valley Electricity Supply Co. Ltd. and another(4) were relied on in support of this contention.	RespArg
We should add that the Appellate Tribunal was also in error in thinking that Shri Palit had failed to advert to the principle on which basic wages should be fixed, and that he had not referred to the doctrine of Dr. Akroyd about the need for a balanced diet of 2,600 calories. It is true that Shri Palit does not in terms refer to these matters in his award. But they were all discussed in the awards of both the Engineering Tribunal and the Mercantile Tribunal. The dispute between the parties was whether the one award or the other should be taken as the basis for fixation of the scale of pay, and Shri Palit decided that it was the Engineering Tribunal's award and not the other that was more appropriate to the class of employees, of which the Union was composed. In basing his award on the award of the Engineering Tribunal, Shri Palit must be taken to have considered all the factors relied on by the Tribunal for fixing the scales and the criticism that the award does not refer to them once again is one of form rather than of substance. We must, therefore, hold that the decision of the Appellate Tribunal cannot be maintained even on its own ground. The position then is this: The question of scales of pay was decided by Shri Palit in his award dated (1) [1951] 2 L.L.J. 31.
(2) [1951] 2 L.L.J. 231.
(2) [1956] 2 L.L.J. 64.	Precedent
89,000, the surplus was sufficient to justify the award to them only of another month's basic wages as bonus. Whether we consider the question on principles of law or of equity, this conclusion is clearly unsound. In law, a claim for bonus will be admissible only if the business had resulted during the year in sufficient profits. And as the reasons for the grant of bonus is that workers should share in the prosperity to which they have contributed, all of them would have the right to participate in it. Therefore, profits can be said to be sufficient to declare a bonus only if they are sufficient to make a payment to all of them. If the profits are not sufficient for that purpose, then the very, condition on which bonus could be declared would be absent, and no question of granting any bonus could arise. As it is common ground that the profits of the Company are not sufficient to justify the award of bonus if it is to be paid to all the workers of the Company in all its units, it follows that there is in law no ground for the grant of bonus. Nor can such a claim be sustained in equity. The entire profits of the Company are the result of the labour of all the workmen and employees in all its units. To grant a bonus to a section of them on the basis of the total profits of the Company will be to give them a share in profits to which they have not contributed. We are wholly unable to appreciate the observation of the Appellate Tribunal that to refuse additional bonus to the Union employees would be to penalise them " not for their own fault but for the laches of the coworkers, who abandoned their claim". The Tribunal forgets that, on its own finding, if all the workmen made a claim, no bonus could have been declared. It is not a question of their abandoning their claim but of their realising that they have none. If the order of the Appellate Tribunal is to be given effect to, some of the employees of the Company would get a bonus, while others not, and as observed in Karam Chand Thappar & Bros.' Workmen v. The Company(1), that must lead to disaffection among the workers and to further industrial disputes. The order of the Appellate Tribunal awarding an additional one months basic wages as bonus is neither legal nor just and must be set aside and the award of Shri Banerji as regards bonus restored.
It is argued for the appellant that under section 7 of the Industrial Disputes (Appellate Tribunal) Act XLVIII of 1950, the order of the Tribunal refusing reinstatement was not open to appeal, as it is not one of the matters set out in section 7(1)(b), and that, in consequence, the order of the Appellate Tribunal in so far as it modified the order of the Tribunal as regards the four employees aforesaid, was without jurisdiction, and the decision in Ranganathan v. Madras Electric Tramways(1) and Sudershan Steel Rolling Mills v. Their Workmen(2) were relied on in support of this contention. It must be mentioned that retrenchment is one of the matters enumerated in section 7 (1) (b), in respect of which an appeal would lie. But if the order is one of dismissal, it cannot be said to be one of retrenchment as that word is ordinarily understood, and will not be appealable under section7(1)(b). In 1953 the legislature enacted the Industrial Disputes (Amendment) Act XLIII of 1953 wherein "retrenchment" was for the first time defined so as to include, subject to certain exceptions, the termination by the employer of the service of workmen for any reason whatsoever. (Vide section 2(oo)). Under this definition, an appeal would be competent under section 7 (1)	Section
It is argued for the appellant that this point is not open to consideration at this stage, as it had not been raised by the Union at any time before, and that, in any event, the matter should be remanded for further enquiry. But the question is whether in view of what appears on the face of the record this is a fit case for our interference in special appeal. The minimum pay fixed by the Appellate Tribunal would be quite proper if the cost of living index is taken, for the purpose of fixing the basic wages, at point 180 instead of 160, and there is no reason why we should not accept it. Nor do we think that a remand is called for in the interests of justice, as, in the face of the undisputed facts, it can only result in the proceedings dragging on and the relationship between the parties deteriorating. Under the circumstances, we do not propose to disturb the minimum pay of Rs. 65 per mensem fixed by the Appellate Tribunal. But we see no justification for raising either the ceiling levels or the starting pay of other categories of employees whose initial pay was Rs. 65 per mensem or more. We accordingly set aside the scale of pay as fixed by the Appellate Tribunal and restore that of Shri Banerji subject to the following modifications:
to S. N. Chatterjee and one year's basic wages with dearness allowance to Joydeb Banerjee and by providing that S. N. Chatterjee, Ashimananda Banerjee and Panchanan Rana should not merely be re-employed but reinstated with continuity of service.
reinstatement was not open to appeal, and the order of the Appellate Tribunal modifying it would therefore be without jurisdiction and void.
ther claims that he is entitled to be reinstated. The Appellate Tribunal has accepted that claim on the ground that he had been discharged without the Company framing a charge or holding an enquiry, and that the rules of natural justice had been violated. We are unable to agree with this decision. The ground of discharge is the continued absence of the employee, and his inability to do work, and it is difficult to see what purpose would be served by a formal charge being delivered to him and what conceivable answer he could give thereto. The order of the Appellate Tribunal is manifestly erroneous and must be set aside. (3) The facts relating to Panchanan Rana are similar to those of Ashimananda Banerjee, and for the reasons already given, the order of the Appellate Tribunal in his favour should be set aside.
In the result, Civil Appeal No. 325 of 1955 is allowed, the order of the Appellate Tribunal set aside and that of Shri Banerji restored, except that (1) the minimum pay of the clerical staff will be Rs. 65 per mensem with modifications as to the ceiling level and increments as set out supra and (2) that S. N. Chatterjee will be reinstated with compensation as provided in the order of the Appellate Tribunal. The Union will pay half the costs of the appellant throughout. Civil Appeal No. 174 of 1956 is dis- missed, but there will be no order as to costs.	Conclusion
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeals Nos. 325 of 1955 and 174 of 1956.
Appeal by special leave from the decision and order dated the 29th April 1955 of the Labour Appellate Tribunal of India at Calcutta in Appeal No. Calcutta-110 of 1953 arising out of the award dated 24th June, 1953, of the Industrial Tribunal, Calcutta.

1956. October 11. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMA AYYAR J.--.Disputes having arisen between Messrs Burn and Company, Calcutta, hereinafter called the Company, and a section of their employees in Howrah Iron Works, hereinafter referred to as the Union, the Government of West Bengal issued a notification on 16-12-1952 referring the same to the First Industrial Tribunal for adjudication.

Against this award, the Union preferred an appeal to the Labour Appellate Tribunal. By its decision dated 29-4-1955 the Appellate Tribunal substantially modified the award of Shri Banerji in favour of the Union it held (1) that the minimum pay of the clerical and sub-staff should be raised, and that corresponding changes should be made in the ceiling level, in the increments and in the scales of pay of other grades of the staff; (2) that the scale of pay of the sarkars and checkers should be increased and incre-

As for Joydeb Banerjee, the Appellate Tribunal held that though his reinstatement was not desirable, he was entitled to one year's basic wages with dearness allowance as compensation. Against this decision, the Company has preferred Civil Appeal No. 325 of 1955 by special leave, and the Union has likewise preferred Civil Appeal No. 174 of 1956, the leave being limited in the latter to the four points raised by the Company in its appeal.
(1) The first question relates to the increase in the minimum wages of the clerical and sub-staff. For a correct understanding of the true position, it is necessary to refer to the facts which form the background of the present dispute. In 1946, the Bengal chamber of Commerce took up the question of fixing, suitably to the changed conditions brought about by World War II, wages and other terms of service of the employees in industrial concerns, and framed a scheme classifying them under different categories, and fixing scales of pay and dearness allowance for the several categories, and that was brought into force in the Company on 1-10-1946. Under this scheme, the scale of pay for the lower categories of employees, with whom we are concerned in these appeals, was as follows:
We should add that the Appellate Tribunal was also in error in thinking that Shri Palit had failed to advert to the principle on which basic wages should be fixed, and that he had not referred to the doctrine of Dr. Akroyd about the need for a balanced diet of 2,600 calories. It is true that Shri Palit does not in terms refer to these matters in his award. But they were all discussed in the awards of both the Engineering Tribunal and the Mercantile Tribunal. The dispute between the parties was whether the one award or the other should be taken as the basis for fixation of the scale of pay, and Shri Palit decided that it was the Engineering Tribunal's award and not the other that was more appropriate to the class of employees, of which the Union was composed. In basing his award on the award of the Engineering Tribunal, Shri Palit must be taken to have considered all the factors relied on by the Tribunal for fixing the scales and the criticism that the award does not refer to them once again is one of form rather than of substance. We must, therefore, hold that the decision of the Appellate Tribunal cannot be maintained even on its own ground. The position then is this: The question of scales of pay was decided by Shri Palit in his award dated (1) [1951] 2 L.L.J. 31.
(2) [1951] 2 L.L.J. 231.
12-6-1950, and the Union was a party to it. It is not alleged that there has been any change in circumstances between that date and 16-12-1952 when the present reference was made to Shri Banerji. On the principles stated above, therefore, the award of Shri Palit should not be disturbed. This conclusion would have entailed the reversal of the order of the Appellate Tribunal and the restoration of the award of Shri Banerji. We are of opinion, however, that the scale fixed by the Appellate Tribunal In its order dated 29- 4-1955 should not be interfered with, in so far as it fixes the minimum pay of the clerical and sub-staff at Rs. 65 per mensem. It is common ground that dearness allowance is payable under the rules of the Company, only when the cost of living index exceeds point 180. The basic wages should therefore be fixed with 180 point as cost of living index. When we turn to the award of the Engineering Tribunal, we find that it fixed the basic wages after taking the cost of living index as 160 points. Before Shri Palit, the Company contended that the scale fixed in the award of the Engineering Tribunal should form the basis of fixation of the pay scale of the Union, and though the Tribunal held that the award was not as such binding on the Union, it agreed with the Company that it was the scale fixed therein and not that fixed in the award of the Mercantile Tribunal that was more appropriate to the clerical staff of an Engineering concern, and adopted the scale fixed by the Company on 31-10-1946 as being "slightly in advance of the terms contained in the Engineering Tribunal's award". It is clear from a reading of the award of Shri Palit that he was not conscious that the basic wages had been fixed by the Engineering Tribunal with point 160 as the cost of living index, and his observation that the scale adopted by the Company was an advance on that fixed by the Engineering Tribunal is consistent only with an assumption by him that the basic wages bad been fixed both by the Company and the Engineering Tribunal with point 180 as the cost of living index. Now, if we are to accept the scale fixed in the award of Shri Palit as did Shri Banerji, the position would. be that while for purposes of basic wages the cost of living index point would be 160, for purposes of dearness allowance it would be 180, and that would work great injustice on the workers. It is the realisation of this fact that must have led Mr. Bose, counsel for the Company' to raise at a late stage of the hearing of the appeal the contention that the 'cost of living index of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce which was adopted by the Company was different from that of the Government. But this contention went against the admission made by Mr. Sen on behalf of the Company at an earlier stage, and was rightly rejected by the Appellate Tribunal and that was abandoned before us. There is thus, on the face of the record, an error of a fundamental character.
It is argued for the appellant that this point is not open to consideration at this stage, as it had not been raised by the Union at any time before, and that, in any event, the matter should be remanded for further enquiry. But the question is whether in view of what appears on the face of the record this is a fit case for our interference in special appeal. The minimum pay fixed by the Appellate Tribunal would be quite proper if the cost of living index is taken, for the purpose of fixing the basic wages, at point 180 instead of 160, and there is no reason why we should not accept it. Nor do we think that a remand is called for in the interests of justice, as, in the face of the undisputed facts, it can only result in the proceedings dragging on and the relationship between the parties deteriorating. Under the circumstances, we do not propose to disturb the minimum pay of Rs. 65 per mensem fixed by the Appellate Tribunal. But we see no justification for raising either the ceiling levels or the starting pay of other categories of employees whose initial pay was Rs. 65 per mensem or more. We accordingly set aside the scale of pay as fixed by the Appellate Tribunal and restore that of Shri Banerji subject to the following modifications:
(2) The second question relates to the grading of sarkars and checkers. The claim put forward on their behalf is that they should be raised to the category of clerks. This was rejected by Shri Palit in his award dated 12-6-1950 and again by Shri Banerji in those proceedings. The Appellate Tribunal before whom this claim was repeated, while observing that the work of sarkars and checkers was "not of the same nature as that of the members of the clerical staff", held, nevertheless, that the scales of pay fixed in the award of the Engineering Tribunal for clerks should be applied to them, and that therefore non-matriculate sarkars and checkers should be put on Rs. 55-2 1/2-80 scale and matriculate sarkars and checkers on Rs. 60-2 1/2-90 scale. We are unable to uphold this order. When once the Appellate Tribunal reached the conclusion that the sarkars and checkers could not be put in the same category as clerks, the question then is simply whether any grounds had been made out for interfering with the fixation of pay scales by Shri Banerji. So far as the sarkars are concerned, the scale had been fixed by Shri Palit, and Shri Banerji adopted it. As no change' in the circumstances was alleged in support of a revision thereof, there was no ground for interfering with it. As for checkers, they are hourly rated workers, and Shri Banerji had revised their pay scale. Apart from stating that "the ends of justice"
89,000, the surplus was sufficient to justify the award to them only of another month's basic wages as bonus. Whether we consider the question on principles of law or of equity, this conclusion is clearly unsound. In law, a claim for bonus will be admissible only if the business had resulted during the year in sufficient profits. And as the reasons for the grant of bonus is that workers should share in the prosperity to which they have contributed, all of them would have the right to participate in it. Therefore, profits can be said to be sufficient to declare a bonus only if they are sufficient to make a payment to all of them. If the profits are not sufficient for that purpose, then the very, condition on which bonus could be declared would be absent, and no question of granting any bonus could arise.

Nor can such a claim be sustained in equity. The entire profits of the Company are the result of the labour of all the workmen and employees in all its units. To grant a bonus to a section of them on the basis of the total profits of the Company will be to give them a share in profits to which they have not contributed. We are wholly unable to appreciate the observation of the Appellate Tribunal that to refuse additional bonus to the Union employees would be to penalise them " not for their own fault but for the laches of the coworkers, who abandoned their claim". The Tribunal forgets that, on its own finding, if all the workmen made a claim, no bonus could have been declared. It is not a question of their abandoning their claim but of their realising that they have none. If the order of the Appellate Tribunal is to be given effect to, some of the employees of the Company would get a bonus, while others not, and as observed in Karam Chand Thappar & Bros.' Workmen v. The Company(1), that must lead to disaffection among the workers and to further industrial disputes. The order of the Appellate Tribunal awarding an additional one months basic wages as bonus is neither legal nor just and must be set aside and the award of Shri Banerji as regards bonus restored.
(4) It remains to deal with the question of the re- instatement and/or compensation of four employees, S. N. Chatterjee, Ashimananda Banerjee, Panchanan Rana and Joydeb Banerjee. It has been already stated that the order of Shri Banerji with reference to them was modified by the Appellate Tribunal by awarding compensation at the rate of six months' basic wages (1) [1953] L.A.C. 152,160.
to S. N. Chatterjee and one year's basic wages with dearness allowance to Joydeb Banerjee and by providing that S. N. Chatterjee, Ashimananda Banerjee and Panchanan Rana should not merely be re-employed but reinstated with continuity of service.
It is argued for the appellant that under section 7 of the Industrial Disputes (Appellate Tribunal) Act XLVIII of 1950, the order of the Tribunal refusing reinstatement was not open to appeal, as it is not one of the matters set out in section 7(1)(b), and that, in consequence, the order of the Appellate Tribunal in so far as it modified the order of the Tribunal as regards the four employees aforesaid, was without jurisdiction, and the decision in Ranganathan v. Madras Electric Tramways(1) and Sudershan Steel Rolling Mills v. Their Workmen(2) were relied on in support of this contention. It must be mentioned that retrenchment is one of the matters enumerated in section 7 (1) (b), in respect of which an appeal would lie. But if the order is one of dismissal, it cannot be said to be one of retrenchment as that word is ordinarily understood, and will not be appealable under section7(1)(b). In 1953 the legislature enacted the Industrial Disputes (Amendment) Act XLIII of 1953 wherein "retrenchment" was for the first time defined so as to include, subject to certain exceptions, the termination by the employer of the service of workmen for any reason whatsoever. (Vide section 2(oo)). Under this definition, an appeal would be competent under section 7 (1)
(b) (vii) in the case of termination of service, subject to the exceptions specified therein. But this Act came into force on the 24th December 1953, and as there is nothing in it giving retrospective operation to this definition, the rights of the parties to the present appeal would remain unaffected by it. Act XLIII of 1953 replaced Ordinance No. V of 1953, wherein also retrenchment was defined as including, subject to exceptions all termination of service; but that also came into force only on the 24th October 1953, whereas the present appeal was filed on 19-8-1953. On that date, the order of the Tribunal refusing (1) A.I.R. 1952 Mad. 669.
(2) [1956] 2 L.L.J. 64.
reinstatement was not open to appeal, and the order of the Appellate Tribunal modifying it would therefore be without jurisdiction and void.
But it is argued for the respondent that an award of the Tribunal refusing reinstatement would be appealable under section 7 (1) (a') if it involved a substantial question of law, and that as the contention of the employees was that the orders dismissing them were bad as having been passed in contravention of ,the rules of natural justice, that was a question of law on which an appeal was competent. It was further contended that when a question arises whether a Tribunal has jurisdiction over the subject-matter, it must be competent to decide whether the preliminary conditions exist, on which its jurisdiction depends, and its decision on that question is not liable to be attacked in civil courts, and that accordingly the assumption of jurisdiction by the Appellate Tribunal on the footing that there was a substantial question of law was not liable to be questioned by the civil court, and the decisions in Pankaj Kumar Ganguli v. Bank of India(3) and Upper Ganges Electric Employees Union v. Upper Ganges Valley Electricity Supply Co. Ltd. and another(4) were relied on in support of this contention.
We agree that an order refusing reinstatement would be open to appeal under section 7(1)(a) if it involved a substantial question of law. Whether a decision of the Appellate Tribunal that an appeal to it from an award was competent under section 7 (1) (a) on the ground that it involved a substantial question of law is final and not open to question in a civil court is a point on which we do not desire to express an opinion, as in the present case, the correctness of that ,decision is challenged not collaterally or in independent proceedings, such as an application under article 226 of the Constitution as in the two cases relied on for the respondent, but by way of appeal under article 136, and it is open to us to consider as a Court of Appeal whether, in fact, the order of the Tribunal was vitiated by an error of law, and whether the (1) [1956] 60 C.W.N. 602. 104 (2) A.I.R. 1956 All. 491, order of the Appellate Tribunal modifying it is sound. We must now consider the case of the four employees from this standpoint:
ther claims that he is entitled to be reinstated. The Appellate Tribunal has accepted that claim on the ground that he had been discharged without the Company framing a charge or holding an enquiry, and that the rules of natural justice had been violated. We are unable to agree with this decision. The ground of discharge is the continued absence of the employee, and his inability to do work, and it is difficult to see what purpose would be served by a formal charge being delivered to him and what conceivable answer he could give thereto. The order of the Appellate Tribunal is manifestly erroneous and must be set aside. (3) The facts relating to Panchanan Rana are similar to those of Ashimananda Banerjee, and for the reasons already given, the order of the Appellate Tribunal in his favour should be set aside.
(4) The question as regards Joydeb Banerjee is whether he is entitled to compensation on the ground that he had been wrongly discharged. The facts are that on 16-11-1950 a number of employees participated in an assault on the Works Manager, Mr. Davison, and the Company dismissed fourteen of them on that ground, and Joydeb Banerjee was one of them. The Appellate Tribunal has held that as no charge was, framed against him or an enquiry held, his dismissal was in contravention of the rules of natural justice. It has accordingly ordered that he should be given one year's basic wages with dearness allowance as compensation. It is true that no charge-sheet was formally drawn up against him, but that would not vitiate the order of dismissal if he knew what the charge against him was and had an opportunity of giving his explanation. It appears from the order of the Tribunal that subsequent to the order of dismissal by the Company, there were conciliation proceedings and an enquiry by the Labour Minister, as a result of which he recommended the reinstatement of seven out of the fourteen who had been dismissed, leaving the order in operation as regards the other seven, of whom Joydeb Banerjee was one. In the face of these facts, it is idle for him to contend that he had been dismissed without hearing or enquiry. The order of the Appellate Tribunal awarding compensation to him should be set aside.
In the result, Civil Appeal No. 325 of 1955 is allowed, the order of the Appellate Tribunal set aside and that of Shri Banerji restored, except that (1) the minimum pay of the clerical staff will be Rs. 65 per mensem with modifications as to the ceiling level and increments as set out supra and (2) that S. N. Chatterjee will be reinstated with compensation as provided in the order of the Appellate Tribunal. The Union will pay half the costs of the appellant throughout. Civil Appeal No. 174 of 1956 is dis- missed, but there will be no order as to costs.	Total Judgement
