Thus, all the points urged on behalf of the appellants fail, but, in one respect, the decree of the High Court must be modified. To appreciate this, reference will have to be made to the following statements made by defendant No. 5 in paragraphs 8 and 11 of his written statement:	PetArg
parkash. Of course there is some oral evidence to support him. But I do not think, on considering and weighing the evidence that separation of Budparkash from Nandkishore has been proved. The learned pleader for the defendant No, 5 has urged that the circumstances considered in the light of the ruling reported in Behar Report, Vol. 4 (1937-38) Privy Council at p. 302, would support the defendant's case as there was defined share of Budparkash and Nandkishore in the Khatyan (exts. G1 and G2). I am not prepared to agree with the learned pleader on this point, as there is not a scrap of paper to show that Budparkash or even after him Kuldip Das separately appropriated the usufruct of any property, or ever Budparkash showed any intention of separation, I expect that if Budparkash had separated, at least on his death the defendant No. 5 would have maintained an account book of his income from the properties in dispute, specially as he lived at a distant place. He does not appear to have ever cared to look after the property or demand accounts from his alleged co-sharers."	RespArg
The third contention urged on behalf of the appellants relates to the question whether the plaintiff is entitled only to maintenance or to a share in the properties left by Nandkishore Das. The rights of an illegitimate son of a Sudra are considered in Mitaksbara Ch. 1, S. 12, which is headed "Rights of a son by a female slave, in the case of a Sudra's estate". This text was fully considered by the Privy Council in Vellaiyappa v. Natarajan(1) and the conclu- sions derived therefrom were summarized as follows :--
It seems to us that the second proposition enunciated above follows from the following passage in the Mitakshara text :--	Precedent
This statement of the law, with which we agree, may be supplemented by three other well-settled principles, these being firstly, that the illegitimate son does not acquire by birth any interest in his father's estate and he cannot therefore demand partition against his father during the latter's lifetime; secondly, that on his father's death, the illegitimate son succeeds as a coparcener to the separate estate of the father along with the legitimate son(s) with a right of survivorship and is entitled to enforce partition against the legitimate son(s); and thirdly, that on a parti- tion between a legitimate and an illegitimate son, the illegitimate son takes only one-half of What he would have taken if he was a legitimate son.
(1) A.I.R. 1931 P.C. 294.
If therefore the illegitimate son is a coparcener with the legitimate son of his father, it must necessarily follow that he is entitled to demand partition against the legiti- mate son. There can be no doubt that though the illegitimate son cannot enforce partition during the father's lifetime and though he is not entitled to demand partition where the father has left no separate property and no legitimate son but was joint with his collaterals, he can enforce partition in a case like the present, where the father was separate from his collaterals and has left separate property and legitimate sons.
Paragraph 11 is rather ambiguously worded, but it was conceded before us by the counsel for defendant No. 5 that the latter had no claim to any interest in the properties set out in schedules other than schedules C and D. Such being the purport of paragraphs 8 and 11, the decree should provide that defendant No. 5 will be entitled only to a share in the properties set out in schedules C and D and will have no share in the properties set out in the other schedules. Subject to this modification, the decree of the High Court is affirmed, and this appeal is dismissed. There will be no order as to costs.

FAZAL ALI J.--This appeal arises out of a suit for partition which was dismissed by the trial court but was decreed by the High Court of Patna on appeal. The material facts of the case are briefly as follows:-
parkash. Of course there is some oral evidence to support him. But I do not think, on considering and weighing the evidence that separation of Budparkash from Nandkishore has been proved. The learned pleader for the defendant No, 5 has urged that the circumstances considered in the light of the ruling reported in Behar Report, Vol. 4 (1937-38) Privy Council at p. 302, would support the defendant's case as there was defined share of Budparkash and Nandkishore in the Khatyan (exts. G1 and G2). I am not prepared to agree with the learned pleader on this point, as there is not a scrap of paper to show that Budparkash or even after him Kuldip Das separately appropriated the usufruct of any property, or ever Budparkash showed any intention of separation, I expect that if Budparkash had separated, at least on his death the defendant No. 5 would have maintained an account book of his income from the properties in dispute, specially as he lived at a distant place. He does not appear to have ever cared to look after the property or demand accounts from his alleged co-sharers."
This summary of the evidence shows firstly, that the two brothers lived in separate houses, secondly, that they paid separate chaukidari taxes, and thirdly, that Budparkash used to get grains and money from Nandkishore from time to time. The trial judge has also observed that the khatyans, exhib- its G 1 and G 2 record the defined shares of the two broth- ers, but the printed record shows that exhibits G 1 and G 2 are mere rent-receipts. As the khatyan was not printed, we sent for the original record and found that the entries in the khatyan, which are exhibits F 1 and F 2, have been correctly noted in the judgment of the trial court. It seems to us therefore that the findings which we have set out give greater support to the oral evidence adduced on behalf of defendant No. 5 than to the evidence adduced by the other parties, and that being so, we think that the finding of the High Court must be upheld. We were greatly impressed by several letters of exhibit-A series, which have been found to be genuine by both the courts below. The genuineness of the letters was attacked before us, but we find no good reason for reversing the findings of the trial judge and the High Court. In one of these let- ters, exhibit A-10, Nandkishore Das writing to Kuldip on the 12th June, 1934, states that he was sending 25 maunds of rice, 7 maunds of khesari and rupees seventy-five and then adds: "I have got with me all the accounts written, which will be explained when you will come and you will render a just account of your share when you come". In another letter, exhibit A-12, which was written by Nandkishore to Kuldip on the I5th October, 1936, the former states: "I wrote to you several times to adjust account of your share, but you did not do so up till now. I write to you to come and examine the account of your share. I have not got money now. If you have got time, then come for a day and have the account adjusted and take what may be found due to you". It seems to us that if the parties were really joint in the legal sense of the term, there was no question of examining the accounts and adjusting them, and there would have been no reference to the share of Kuldip in the produce or the money collected. The proper conclusion to be arrived at is, as the witnesses for defendant No. 5 have stated, that though there was no partition by metes and bounds, the two brothers were divided in status and enjoyed the usufruct of the properties according to their respective shares. Several witnesses were examined on behalf of de- fendant No. 5, who have stated from their personal knowledge that the two brothers lived in separate houses, were sepa- rate in mess and the produce was divided between them half and half. It seems to us that the finding of the High Court as to the separation of the two brothers must be upheld.
The third contention urged on behalf of the appellants relates to the question whether the plaintiff is entitled only to maintenance or to a share in the properties left by Nandkishore Das. The rights of an illegitimate son of a Sudra are considered in Mitaksbara Ch. 1, S. 12, which is headed "Rights of a son by a female slave, in the case of a Sudra's estate". This text was fully considered by the Privy Council in Vellaiyappa v. Natarajan(1) and the conclu- sions derived therefrom were summarized as follows :--
This statement of the law, with which we agree, may be supplemented by three other well-settled principles, these being firstly, that the illegitimate son does not acquire by birth any interest in his father's estate and he cannot therefore demand partition against his father during the latter's lifetime; secondly, that on his father's death, the illegitimate son succeeds as a coparcener to the separate estate of the father along with the legitimate son(s) with a right of survivorship and is entitled to enforce partition against the legitimate son(s); and thirdly, that on a parti- tion between a legitimate and an illegitimate son, the illegitimate son takes only one-half of What he would have taken if he was a legitimate son.
(1) A.I.R. 1931 P.C. 294.
It seems to us that the second proposition enunciated above follows from the following passage in the Mitakshara text :--
If therefore the illegitimate son is a coparcener with the legitimate son of his father, it must necessarily follow that he is entitled to demand partition against the legiti- mate son. There can be no doubt that though the illegitimate son cannot enforce partition during the father's lifetime and though he is not entitled to demand partition where the father has left no separate property and no legitimate son but was joint with his collaterals, he can enforce partition in a case like the present, where the father was separate from his collaterals and has left separate property and legitimate sons.
The last point put forward on behalf of the appellants was that the plaintiff not being in possession of the properties which are the subject of the suit, he cannot maintain a suit for partition. This contention cannot prevail, because the plaintiff is undoubtedly a cosharer in the properties and unless exclusion and ouster are pleaded and proved, which is not the case here, is entitled to partition.
Thus, all the points urged on behalf of the appellants fail, but, in one respect, the decree of the High Court must be modified. To appreciate this, reference will have to be made to the following statements made by defendant No. 5 in paragraphs 8 and 11 of his written statement:
Paragraph 11 is rather ambiguously worded, but it was conceded before us by the counsel for defendant No. 5 that the latter had no claim to any interest in the properties set out in schedules other than schedules C and D. Such being the purport of paragraphs 8 and 11, the decree should provide that defendant No. 5 will be entitled only to a share in the properties set out in schedules C and D and will have no share in the properties set out in the other schedules. Subject to this modification, the decree of the High Court is affirmed, and this appeal is dismissed. There will be no order as to costs.
