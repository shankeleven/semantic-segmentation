CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal No. 500 of 1957. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated September 11, 1956, as altered by Order dated September 28, 1956, of the Labour Appellate Tribunal of India, Calcutta, in Appeals Nos. Cal. 208 and 223 of 1956, arising out of the Award dated June 7, 1956, of the Sixth Industrial Tribunal, Calcutta, in Case No. VIII-233 of 1955. M.C. Setalvad, Attorney-General for India, D. N.

Y.Kumar, for respondents Nos. 2 to 25 and 27 to 48. 1958. October 17. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR, J.-This is an appeal by special leave against the order of the Labour Appellate Tribunal and the question for decision is the dismissal of some workmen. The appellant before us is the employer and the respondents are some of' the workmen, 47 in number who might be divided into two sets, the first set Nos. 2 to 24 and second Nos. 25 to 48. Out of the latter No. 26 is dead.	Issue
The facts leading to the appeal are that on August 3, 1953, the Government of West Bengal referred under s. 10 of the Industrial Disputes Act, hereinafter called the Act, to the second Industrial Tribunal, an industrial dispute between the appellant and its workmen. During the pendency of this Reference the workmen acted in a manner subversive of discipline, wilful insubordination and disobedience inasmuch as they surrounded by forming a kind of cordon round E. L. D'Cruz, acting Works Manager of the company, illegally confined him in a small place in the factory premises and kept him so confined between the hours of 9-15 a.m. to 2-15 p.m., till he was rescued by the police. The cause of this action on the part of the workmen is stated to be a dispute as to the payment of Puja bonus for the year 1953. The same day the workmen went on strike at 9-15 a.m. D'Cruz called upon them to resume work but they refused and the appellant- company issued notices at 9-45 a. m., and 10-45 a.m. asking the workmen to resume work immediately. The workmen took no notice of these notices and the appellant company after the arrival of the police declared a lock out. Some of the workmen were then arrested. The appellant company then served charge sheet on the workmen calling upon them to submit their explanations within 24 hours. The workmen gave no explanation. An enquiry was held and the workmen were found guilty of gross misconduct amounting to major misdemeanour which merited dismissal and the company proposed to dismiss them. For that purpose the appellant company on October 31,1953, made three applications Cal. Nos. 518, 519 and 557 of 1953 to the Tribunal for permission under s. 33 of the Act to dismiss 170 workmen with effect from October 6, 1953. During the course of the proceedings the appellant company withdrew its case against a large number of workmen and the proceedings were ultimately continued against 67 workmen. One of these workmen died and two resigned leaving 64 workmen against whom the proceedings were continued.
The workmen in their defence denied the commission of any offence and also denied the receipt of charge sheets. They pleaded that there was no enquiry, that the lock-out was illegal and that the appellant had acted in contravention of the principles of natural justice. The three applications were heard together and were disposed of by one order. The Tribunal held that a prima facie case had been made out for granting permission for dismissal of workmen directly involved in the incident; that the appellant company had acted bona fide and that it was not guilty of discrimination, vindictiveness or arbitrary action. Although it had started cases against 170 workmen it took back a majority of them on their expressing regret. The Tribunal gave permission for the dismisSal of only three workmen Subbas Roy, Madhusudhan Rout and Bimal Kumar Ghose and permission with regard to the rest was refused on the ground that there was reasonable doubt as to their identity and complicity in the incident. On January 8, 1954, the workmen made an application under s. 33A of the Act which was allowed on July 2, 1954. Three appeals were filed, two by the appellant company against the orders under s. 33 and the other made under s. 33A of the Act. The third appeal was filed by workmen as to the dismissal of three workmen. On March 29, 1955, the appeal of the company with regard to application under s. 33 of the Act was dismissed and so was the appeal of the workmen and thus the order as to 3 workmen was upheld. The employers contended that as the strike was illegal, the management had the right to terminate the services of the workmen and the Tribunal was therefore bound to accord sanction to the management but the Labour Appellate Tribunal did not go into this matter as the question had not been raised at any pre- vious stage. On the same day tile Labour Appellate Tribunal set aside the order of the Tribunal under s. 33A on the ground that the application under that section was misconceived and the order made by the Tribunal was without jurisdiction.
Sixteen workmen resigned and one of them Haroo Haldar pleaded guilty and therefore proceedings were continued against only 47 workmen. The Tribunal (6th Industrial Tribunal, West Bengal) made its award on June 7, 1956. It held that the workmen Nos. 2 to 24 had not been properly served and ordered their reinstatement as from April 1, 1955, with back wages, dearness allowance, etc., from April 1, 1955, but upheld the dismissal of workmen Nos. 25 to 48. It held that there was evidence to establish the identity of persons who had taken part in the strike and had wrongfully confined D'Cruz and that no bias or illwill could be attributed to the management nor was it inspired by any vindictive motives. It said:
In our opinion, the Industrial Tribunal proceeded on correct principles as to its power in regard to an enquiry held by the management and the Labour Appellate Tribunal seems to have approached the question as if it was sitting in appeal against the decision taken by the management in regard to the termination of service of their workmen. In the instant case none of the principles, which have been laid down by Labour Courts as well as by this Court in regard to enquiry by the management into the misconduct of their workmen, have been violated and the Labour Appellate Tribunal was in error in setting aside the order of the Industrial Tribunal on the ground that it was unable to accept the testimony of D'Cruz as to the identity of persons who bad taken part in wrongfully confining him on the day of the illegal strike. It appears to have proceeded as if it was sitting in appeal against the decision of the managerial enquiry and further it was under a misapprehension as to the nature of the proceedings before the Industrial Tribunal and before itself, inasmuch as it seems to have been under the wrong impression that the appeal before it arose out of an application under s. 33 -of the Act and that the Industrial Tribunal had given permission to the appellant company to discharge its workmen. Its amended order shows that it thought, and again wrongly, that really the proceedings were under s. 33A of the Act and it was that mistaken view of the nature of the proceedings which led to its order for reinstatement of the workmen with back wages from April 1, 1955, to the date of reinstatement. The Labour Appellate Tribunal seems to have overlooked the fact that the appeal before it arose out of a Reference made by the West Bengal Government under s. 10 of the Act. This misconception as to the nature of the proceedings vitiated its order as the Appellate Tribunal misdirected itself as to the scope of the powers to be exercised by it and consequently it led to the making of an erroneous order.	Facts
On April 20, 1955, the management of the appellant company took fresh proceedings against the 64 workmen and in order to serve charge sheets on them sent registered notices to their addresses, registered with the appellant company, and also affixed notices on its Notice Boards both inside the premises and outside the gate of the premises which remained affixed there from April 20, 1955, till June 9, 1955. Out of the registered notices sent notices could not be served on workmen Nos. 2 to 24 and they were returned. to the sender with the remark that the addressees had either left or their addresses were unknown. On April 28, 1955, the appellant company wrote a letter to the Labour Commissioner informing him of the offences committed by the workmen and the action that it proposed to take against its workmen. On May 20, 1955, the appellant company wrote to the secretary of the Workers Union asking him for the addresses of the workmen who had not been served but it received no reply from the secretary. The enquiry started by the management of the appellant company terminated on June 9, 1955, and as at that time no proceedings were pending under the Act, the appellant company terminated the services of all the 64 workmen on June 22, 1955.
which would debar the appellant company from holding the second enquiry or dismissing the workmen provided the principles above set out are complied with. It was next contended that in the present case there was a basic error within the meaning of the rule laid down by S. K. Das J., in Indian Iron and Steel Co. Ltd. v. Their Workmen(1). The - basic error according to counsel was this that the appellant company's witness Serjeant Boards had stated that the number of persons who had confined and were surrounding D'Cruz was 100 to 130 persons and if out of them 106 were reinstated there could not be 67 workmen left to be proceeded against. The appellant company had started proceedings against 170 workmen i. e. all their workmen and after reinstatement of a large number of them only 67 remained against whom the appellant company took proceedings with a view to take action against them and. it was in regard to these persons that permission for dismissal was sought under s. 33. It is significant that this basic error does not seem to have been argued either before the Industrial Tribunal or the Labour Appellate Tribunal, on the other hand, the parties seem to have proceeded on the basis that the number of workmen proceeded against by the appellant company was 67 out of whom 64 were left after three were allowed to be dismissed. Out of the rest 16 bad resigned and there were only 48 persons whose cases remained for adjudication by the Industrial Tribunal. No basic error is therefore made out.	PetArg
In Lakshmi Devi Sugar Mills Ltd. v. Pt. Ram Sarup which was a case under s. 22 of the Industrial Disputes (Appellate Tribunal) Act, 1950, this Court held that if it was established that the workmen had resorted to illegal strike, that a fair enquiry into the alleged misconduct and insubordination of their workmen had been held by the management without violating any principles of natural justice and as a result of enquiry the management had found the workmen guilty of misconduct and insubordination with which they had been charged and the management had come to the conclusion that continuing the workmen in its employ was dangerous in the interest of the company the Tribunal would not interfere with such order.
In Hanuman Jute Mills v. Amin Das (2) it was held that no appeal lies against the order of an Industrial Tribunal where the Tribunal had examined the question whether the discretion of the employer to dismiss certain workmen was properly exercised, whether the employer was acting bona fide, whether he had resorted to any unfair labour practice or victimization and whether his desire to dismiss the workmen was actuated by any improper motive. It is for the management to determine what constitutes major misconduct within its standing orders sufficient to merit dismissal of a workman but in (1) A.I.R. 1957 S.C. 82.	Precedent
The termination of the services of these workmen gave rise to an industrial dispute and a reference was made by the West Bengal Government on August 8, 1955, in regard to all the 64 workmen. The points referred for adjudication.were:-
(2) A.I.R. 1957 S-C. 194.
determination such misconduct it must have facts upon which to base its conclusions and it must act in good faith without caprice or discrimination and without motives of vindictiveness, intimidation or resorting to unfair labour practice and there must be no infraction of the accepted rules of natural justice. When the management does have facts from which it can conclude misconduct its judgment cannot be questioned provided the above mentioned principles are not violated. But in the absence of these facts or in case of violation of the principles set out above its position is untenable.
The question then arises as to whether the managerial enquiry was vitiated by the infraction of any principle of natural justice. According to the standing orders Major Misdemeanors have been defined in el. 15, the relevant portion of which is:-
As the purpose of s. 33 of the Act is merely to give or withhold permission and not to adjudicate upon an industrial dispute, any findidg under s. 33 would not operate as res judicata and bar the raising of an industrial dispute nor is there anything in the section itself or in the findings arrived at by the Industrial Tribunal in s. 33 proceedings dated June 6, 1954, or of the Labour Appellate Tribunal dated March 29, 1955, (I) [1953] S.C.R. 720. 788. (2) A.I.R. 1057 S.C. 82. (3) [1955] I S.C.R. 1241.	Section
The appeal is therefore allowed and the decision of the Labour Appellate Tribunal as to all the workmen and the award of the Industrial Tribunal as to workmen Nos. 2 to 24 are set aside and the claim for compensation which was argued before us is disallowed. As the workmen have been dismissed and no compensation has been allowed the proper order as to costs is that both parties do pay their costs of this appeal.
Appeal allowed.	Conclusion
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal No. 500 of 1957. Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated September 11, 1956, as altered by Order dated September 28, 1956, of the Labour Appellate Tribunal of India, Calcutta, in Appeals Nos. Cal. 208 and 223 of 1956, arising out of the Award dated June 7, 1956, of the Sixth Industrial Tribunal, Calcutta, in Case No. VIII-233 of 1955. M.C. Setalvad, Attorney-General for India, D. N.

Y.Kumar, for respondents Nos. 2 to 25 and 27 to 48. 1958. October 17. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR, J.-This is an appeal by special leave against the order of the Labour Appellate Tribunal and the question for decision is the dismissal of some workmen. The appellant before us is the employer and the respondents are some of' the workmen, 47 in number who might be divided into two sets, the first set Nos. 2 to 24 and second Nos. 25 to 48. Out of the latter No. 26 is dead.
The facts leading to the appeal are that on August 3, 1953, the Government of West Bengal referred under s. 10 of the Industrial Disputes Act, hereinafter called the Act, to the second Industrial Tribunal, an industrial dispute between the appellant and its workmen. During the pendency of this Reference the workmen acted in a manner subversive of discipline, wilful insubordination and disobedience inasmuch as they surrounded by forming a kind of cordon round E. L. D'Cruz, acting Works Manager of the company, illegally confined him in a small place in the factory premises and kept him so confined between the hours of 9-15 a.m. to 2-15 p.m., till he was rescued by the police. The cause of this action on the part of the workmen is stated to be a dispute as to the payment of Puja bonus for the year 1953. The same day the workmen went on strike at 9-15 a.m. D'Cruz called upon them to resume work but they refused and the appellant- company issued notices at 9-45 a. m., and 10-45 a.m. asking the workmen to resume work immediately. The workmen took no notice of these notices and the appellant company after the arrival of the police declared a lock out. Some of the workmen were then arrested. The appellant company then served charge sheet on the workmen calling upon them to submit their explanations within 24 hours. The workmen gave no explanation. An enquiry was held and the workmen were found guilty of gross misconduct amounting to major misdemeanour which merited dismissal and the company proposed to dismiss them. For that purpose the appellant company on October 31,1953, made three applications Cal. Nos. 518, 519 and 557 of 1953 to the Tribunal for permission under s. 33 of the Act to dismiss 170 workmen with effect from October 6, 1953. During the course of the proceedings the appellant company withdrew its case against a large number of workmen and the proceedings were ultimately continued against 67 workmen. One of these workmen died and two resigned leaving 64 workmen against whom the proceedings were continued.
The workmen in their defence denied the commission of any offence and also denied the receipt of charge sheets. They pleaded that there was no enquiry, that the lock-out was illegal and that the appellant had acted in contravention of the principles of natural justice. The three applications were heard together and were disposed of by one order. The Tribunal held that a prima facie case had been made out for granting permission for dismissal of workmen directly involved in the incident; that the appellant company had acted bona fide and that it was not guilty of discrimination, vindictiveness or arbitrary action. Although it had started cases against 170 workmen it took back a majority of them on their expressing regret. The Tribunal gave permission for the dismisSal of only three workmen Subbas Roy, Madhusudhan Rout and Bimal Kumar Ghose and permission with regard to the rest was refused on the ground that there was reasonable doubt as to their identity and complicity in the incident. On January 8, 1954, the workmen made an application under s. 33A of the Act which was allowed on July 2, 1954. Three appeals were filed, two by the appellant company against the orders under s. 33 and the other made under s. 33A of the Act. The third appeal was filed by workmen as to the dismissal of three workmen. On March 29, 1955, the appeal of the company with regard to application under s. 33 of the Act was dismissed and so was the appeal of the workmen and thus the order as to 3 workmen was upheld. The employers contended that as the strike was illegal, the management had the right to terminate the services of the workmen and the Tribunal was therefore bound to accord sanction to the management but the Labour Appellate Tribunal did not go into this matter as the question had not been raised at any pre- vious stage. On the same day tile Labour Appellate Tribunal set aside the order of the Tribunal under s. 33A on the ground that the application under that section was misconceived and the order made by the Tribunal was without jurisdiction.
On April 20, 1955, the management of the appellant company took fresh proceedings against the 64 workmen and in order to serve charge sheets on them sent registered notices to their addresses, registered with the appellant company, and also affixed notices on its Notice Boards both inside the premises and outside the gate of the premises which remained affixed there from April 20, 1955, till June 9, 1955. Out of the registered notices sent notices could not be served on workmen Nos. 2 to 24 and they were returned. to the sender with the remark that the addressees had either left or their addresses were unknown.

On May 20, 1955, the appellant company wrote to the secretary of the Workers Union asking him for the addresses of the workmen who had not been served but it received no reply from the secretary. The enquiry started by the management of the appellant company terminated on June 9, 1955, and as at that time no proceedings were pending under the Act, the appellant company terminated the services of all the 64 workmen on June 22, 1955.
The termination of the services of these workmen gave rise to an industrial dispute and a reference was made by the West Bengal Government on August 8, 1955, in regard to all the 64 workmen. The points referred for adjudication.were:-
Sixteen workmen resigned and one of them Haroo Haldar pleaded guilty and therefore proceedings were continued against only 47 workmen. The Tribunal (6th Industrial Tribunal, West Bengal) made its award on June 7, 1956. It held that the workmen Nos. 2 to 24 had not been properly served and ordered their reinstatement as from April 1, 1955, with back wages, dearness allowance, etc., from April 1, 1955, but upheld the dismissal of workmen Nos. 25 to 48. It held that there was evidence to establish the identity of persons who had taken part in the strike and had wrongfully confined D'Cruz and that no bias or illwill could be attributed to the management nor was it inspired by any vindictive motives. It said:
Undoubtedly, the management of a concern has power to direct its own internal administration and discipline; but the power, is not unlimited and when a dispute arises, Industrial Tribunals have been given the power to see whether the termination of service of a workman is justified and to give appropriate relief. In cases of dismissal or misconduct, the Tribunal does not, however, act as a Court of appeal and -substitute its own judgment for that of the management. It will interfere (i)-when there is want of good faith, (ii) when there is victimisation or unfair labour; practice, (iii) when the management has been guilty of a basic error or violation of a principle of natural justice, and (iv) when on the materials, the finding is completely baseless or perverse."
In Lakshmi Devi Sugar Mills Ltd. v. Pt. Ram Sarup which was a case under s. 22 of the Industrial Disputes (Appellate Tribunal) Act, 1950, this Court held that if it was established that the workmen had resorted to illegal strike, that a fair enquiry into the alleged misconduct and insubordination of their workmen had been held by the management without violating any principles of natural justice and as a result of enquiry the management had found the workmen guilty of misconduct and insubordination with which they had been charged and the management had come to the conclusion that continuing the workmen in its employ was dangerous in the interest of the company the Tribunal would not interfere with such order.

Amin Das (2) it was held that no appeal lies against the order of an Industrial Tribunal where the Tribunal had examined the question whether the discretion of the employer to dismiss certain workmen was properly exercised, whether the employer was acting bona fide, whether he had resorted to any unfair labour practice or victimization and whether his desire to dismiss the workmen was actuated by any improper motive. It is for the management to determine what constitutes major misconduct within its standing orders sufficient to merit dismissal of a workman but in (1) A.I.R. 1957 S.C. 82.
(2) A.I.R. 1957 S-C. 194.
determination such misconduct it must have facts upon which to base its conclusions and it must act in good faith without caprice or discrimination and without motives of vindictiveness, intimidation or resorting to unfair labour practice and there must be no infraction of the accepted rules of natural justice. When the management does have facts from which it can conclude misconduct its judgment cannot be questioned provided the above mentioned principles are not violated. But in the absence of these facts or in case of violation of the principles set out above its position is untenable.
In our opinion, the Industrial Tribunal proceeded on correct principles as to its power in regard to an enquiry held by the management and the Labour Appellate Tribunal seems to have approached the question as if it was sitting in appeal against the decision taken by the management in regard to the termination of service of their workmen. In the instant case none of the principles, which have been laid down by Labour Courts as well as by this Court in regard to enquiry by the management into the misconduct of their workmen, have been violated and the Labour Appellate Tribunal was in error in setting aside the order of the Industrial Tribunal on the ground that it was unable to accept the testimony of D'Cruz as to the identity of persons who bad taken part in wrongfully confining him on the day of the illegal strike.

The Labour Appellate Tribunal seems to have overlooked the fact that the appeal before it arose out of a Reference made by the West Bengal Government under s. 10 of the Act. This misconception as to the nature of the proceedings vitiated its order as the Appellate Tribunal misdirected itself as to the scope of the powers to be exercised by it and consequently it led to the making of an erroneous order.
The question then arises as to whether the managerial enquiry was vitiated by the infraction of any principle of natural justice. According to the standing orders Major Misdemeanors have been defined in el. 15, the relevant portion of which is:-
As the purpose of s. 33 of the Act is merely to give or withhold permission and not to adjudicate upon an industrial dispute, any findidg under s. 33 would not operate as res judicata and bar the raising of an industrial dispute nor is there anything in the section itself or in the findings arrived at by the Industrial Tribunal in s. 33 proceedings dated June 6, 1954, or of the Labour Appellate Tribunal dated March 29, 1955, (I) [1953] S.C.R. 720. 788. (2) A.I.R. 1057 S.C. 82. (3) [1955] I S.C.R. 1241.
which would debar the appellant company from holding the second enquiry or dismissing the workmen provided the principles above set out are complied with. It was next contended that in the present case there was a basic error within the meaning of the rule laid down by S. K. Das J., in Indian Iron and Steel Co. Ltd. v. Their Workmen(1). The - basic error according to counsel was this that the appellant company's witness Serjeant Boards had stated that the number of persons who had confined and were surrounding D'Cruz was 100 to 130 persons and if out of them 106 were reinstated there could not be 67 workmen left to be proceeded against. The appellant company had started proceedings against 170 workmen i. e. all their workmen and after reinstatement of a large number of them only 67 remained against whom the appellant company took proceedings with a view to take action against them and. it was in regard to these persons that permission for dismissal was sought under s. 33. It is significant that this basic error does not seem to have been argued either before the Industrial Tribunal or the Labour Appellate Tribunal, on the other hand, the parties seem to have proceeded on the basis that the number of workmen proceeded against by the appellant company was 67 out of whom 64 were left after three were allowed to be dismissed. Out of the rest 16 bad resigned and there were only 48 persons whose cases remained for adjudication by the Industrial Tribunal. No basic error is therefore made out.
The question of compensation to the workmen from the date when they were ordered to be reinstated i.e. from April 1, 1955, to June 6, 1955, when their services were terminated is equally unsustainable. The Industrial Tribunal in its order of June 26, 1954, and the Labour Appellate Tribunal in its order dated March 29, 1955, held the strike to be illegal. Mr. S. C. Sen Gupta Judge of the 6th Industrial Tribunal who gave the award dated June 7, 1956, refused to give any compensation to workmen Nos. 25 to 48 whose dismis- sal. he upheld on the ground that the strike was illegal, (1) A.I.R. 1958 S.C. 130.
the strikers had taken up a belligerent attitude and the lock out was fully justified. The Labour Appellate Tribunal awarded to the 24 workmen reinstated by its amended order dated September 28, 1956, back wages from April 1, 1956, to the date of reinstatement as was done by the Industrial Tribunal in the case of workmen Nos. 2 to 24, whom the Tribunal bad ordered to be reinstated. As we have come to the conclusion that the order of reinstatement by the Industrial Tribunal of workmen Nos. 2 to 24 and by the Appellate Tribunal of workmen Nos. 25 to 48 was erroneous, neither of the two sets of workmen is entitled to back wages by way of compensation.
The appeal is therefore allowed and the decision of the Labour Appellate Tribunal as to all the workmen and the award of the Industrial Tribunal as to workmen Nos. 2 to 24 are set aside and the claim for compensation which was argued before us is disallowed. As the workmen have been dismissed and no compensation has been allowed the proper order as to costs is that both parties do pay their costs of this appeal.
Appeal allowed.	Total Judgement
