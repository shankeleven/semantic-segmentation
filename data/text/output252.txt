R. Case No. 2107 of 1950.
M.C. Setalvad, Attorney-General for India (P. A. Mehta, with him), for the intervener.	Issue
The appellant was convicted under section 7 (1) of essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act of 1946 for an offence said to have been committed on the 24th of October, 1950 The conviction was on At two counts: (1) for selling cloth above the controlled rate and (2) for not issuing a cash memo. The sentence was rigorous imprisonment for three months and a fine of Rs. 200 with another three months in default. The trial was before the 8th Presidency Magistrate at Calcutta who adopted a summary procedure.
There was an application for revision before the High Court but it was dismissed. An application for leave to appeal to this Court was then filed. It was granted on a ground which was not taken either in the original court or in the revision before the High Court, namely that the Essential Supplies Act of 1946 under which the appellant was convicted was not in force on the 24th of October, 1950, and-so there could be no conviction under it. The validity of this Act was challenged in Joylal Agarwala v. The State(1) but this Court he-Id that the Act was valid up to the 31st of March, 1950, that being the life of the Act at the date relevant to that case. It is necessary to explain that the Act-is a temporary Act and that its life has been extended from time to time after the date of its first expiry for a year at a time. The latest extension at the date of the previous case was up to the 31st of March, 1950. We therefore start with the position that the Act was a good Act up till that date.	Facts
N.C. Chakravarti for the appellant.
Turning to sub-section (1) of section 8 we find that the British Parliament invested the Constituent Assembly with all the powers of the Dominion Legislature " for the purpose of making provision as to the constitution of the Dominion." That power it exercised and drew up the Indian Constitution, but in doing so it decided to bring the constitution into being in two instalments and it did that by enacting article 394 and enacting in it that that-article and certain others, including article 379, should come into force " at once "-at once being the 26th of November, 1949- while the remaining articles were to come into force on the 26th of January, 1950.	PetArg
B.Sen for the respondent.
It was argued on behalf the appellant that because of this article the Constituent Assembly disappeared as a law making body on and after the 26th of November, 1949, and that its place was taken by the Provisional Parliament referred to by that article, and as the resolution of the 20th December, 1949, purports to be a resolution of the Constituent Assembly (Legislative) and not of the Provisional Parliament, it is a resolution of a body which no longer had authority to enact laws or pass a resolution of this kind affecting the laws of the land.	RespArg
1952. December 5. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BOSE J.-This is an appeal under article 132 (1) of the Constitution. Leave to appeal was granted by the High Court at Calcutta.
The Act was further extended up till the 31st of March, 1951, by a resolution dated the 20th of December, 1949. This is the extension with which we are concerned and which is now challenged, the argument being that there was no legislative body in existence on that date competent to extend the life of the Act for another year. The Gazette notification setting out the resolution is in the following terms (1) [1952] S.C.R. 127.
No. F.-7 WL (1) 47.-The following resolution which wag passed by the Constituent Assembly (Legislative) at its meeting held on the 20th of December, 1949, is hereby published for general information :	Precedent
`` New Delhi, the 22nd December, 1949.
General by an Adaptation Order substituted the words "
Governor-General introduced section4-A into the British Act of 1946, the India (Central Government and Legislature) Act, 1946, by way of adaptation and conferred on the Constituent Assembly the, powers of the Dominion Legislature. Thus the Constituent Assembly became empowered to extend the period fixed in section 4 by the passing of a resolution and that in its turn had the effect of extending the life of the Essential Supplies Act of 1946, because section 1 (3) of that Act says that it shall cease to have effect on the expiration of the period mentioned in section 4 of the India (Central Government and Legislature) Act of 1946. Now section 4-A provides that the Constituent Assembly shall have the powers of the Dominion Legislature under the British Act " until other provision is made by or in accordance with a law made by the Constituent Assembly under sub-section (1) of section 8 of the Indian Independence Act, 1947."
Now article 379 (1) provides that--
`` Until both Houses of Parliament have been duly constituted and summoned to meet for the first session under the provisions of this Constitution, the body functioning as the Constituent Assembly of the Dominion of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution shall be the Provisional Parliament and shall exercise all the powers and perform all the duties conferred by the provisions of this Constitution on Parliament."

1952. December 5. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BOSE J.-This is an appeal under article 132 (1) of the Constitution. Leave to appeal was granted by the High Court at Calcutta.

The Act was further extended up till the 31st of March, 1951, by a resolution dated the 20th of December, 1949.

`` New Delhi, the 22nd December, 1949.
No. F.-7 WL (1) 47.-The following resolution which wag passed by the Constituent Assembly (Legislative) at its meeting held on the 20th of December, 1949, is hereby published for general information :
General by an Adaptation Order substituted the words "

The learned Attorney- General argues, on the other hand, that the Constituent Assembly continued to function as such and to retain its right to exercise its dual functions of constitution making and law making right up to the last stroke of midnight on the 25th of January, 1950. The very next second, when a new day ushered in a new era for this country, it ceased to exist as a Constituent Assembly and its place was taken by the Provisional Parliament of India. We need not decide this point, for even if the Provisional Parliament was intended to function on -the 26th of November, 1949, and not from the 26th of January, 1950, it is clear that the Constituent Assembly was to continue in existence till " the commencement of the Constitution"	Total Judgement
