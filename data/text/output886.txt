Appeal from the judgment and order dated January 5, 1953, of the Calcutta High Court (Original Side) in Income Tax Reference Appeal No. 12 of 1942 and appeals from the judgment and order dated July 2, 1952, of the Assam High Court at Gauhati in Agricultural Income Tax References Nos. 1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 6 and 8 of 1949 respectively.
42. The assessee in that case was a -/8/9 annas co-sharer in a zamindari estate known as " Parbatjoar estate " in Assam. The original assessee was Jyotindra Narayan Chowdhury who died on January 25, 1953, and on his death his widow, Shrimati Sindhurani Chowdhurani and others were substituted. The gross in, agricultural income of the assessee was Rs. 89,633 and income from salami was Rs. 9,331-9-4 which was received from settlement of 414 different holdings out of which 278 were holdings of virgin lands and 136 were those of what are described as auction- purchase lands. Out of the gross income from salami 15 per cent. has been allowed as collection charges and the amount in dispute in this appeal therefore is Rs. 7,934. The Agricultural Income Tax Officer held this sum to be "agricultural income " by his order dated November 10, 1941, which was affirmed on appeal to the Assistant Commissioner of Agricultural Income Tax. The revision taken to the Commissioner under s. 27 of the Act was dismissed but at the instance of the assessee the following two questions were referred for the opinion of the High Court.
2. Rate of salami varies with the quality of the lands, two fixed rates being Rs. 7 per bigha for jungle lands and Rs. 10 per bigha for non-jungle lands.	Facts

The Calcutta High Court by its judgment dated April 12, 1945, held these receipts to be " agricultural income." Against this judgment an appeal was taken to the Privy Council but on the abolition of the jurisdiction of the Privy Council the appeal was transferred to the Federal Court and was heard by that court as C. A. No. 30 of 1949. That court set aside the judgment of the High Court and remitted the case to the High Court " to be dealt with again after ascertaining and considering the following additional factors likely to show the true nature of the receipts described as It salami in the present case.
In the Statement of the Case the Board said that the zamindar's business or vocation was letting out holdings against payment. The area of land held by him was a large one "which he lets out piecemeal to various tenants on conditions among others that the would be tenant will first pay a fee which he prefers to call salami' and that he will pay an annual rent. " It held that this payment was not "a windfall", that the " isalami' arose from the landlord's business of letting out his lands, and............ is an income", that because of the " regularity or periodicity "
agricultural income " and the Board has brought this appeal (C.A. No. 162 of 1955) against that judgment. In the Assam Appeals also the areas of land held by the assessees were large and total income in the case of "
There were no evictions under s. 69 of the Assam Tenancy Act of non-occupancy tenants but ejectments did take place and action was taken under s. 68 of the Act. After the re- statement of the case on the lines suggested by the Federal Court, the Assam High Court held that " salami " is not rent but revenue derived from land and is therefore income..............
In Captain Maharaj Kumar Gopal Saran Narain Singh v. The Commissioner of Income Tax, Bihar & Orissa (2), Lord Russell of Killowen after referring to the definition given by Sir George Lowndes held that life annuity paid out of an estate is income.
Salami was described by Lord Wright in Kamakshya Narain Singh v. The COMMissioner of Income Tax (1), a case of a grant of a mining lease for a period of 999 years, in the following words:
In Raja Shiv Prasad Singh v. The Crown(2) where also the lease was a mining lease for a period of 999 years, salami was described as a sum which is payable at the inception of the lease and as a nonrecurring payment in the nature of a premium for granting a lease.
In Commissioner of Income Tax v. Maharajadhiraj Kumar Visheshwar Singh (3) an area measuring 41 bighas of land was settled for an indefinite (bemead) period on a yearly rent and in the event of default of two consecutive instalments the lessee could be dispossessed and was also liable to other penalties. This land was settled with the lessee to enable him to build a " gola house" and a platform for the rice mill. The lease was taken to be in the nature of a permanent lease and it was held that salami represented the price for parting with the land and was not merely an advance rent and as it was not a recurring payment, it did not fall within the definition of the word 'income' as given in Commissioner of Income Tax v. Shaw Wallace & Co. (4). Manoharlal J. who gave a concurrent judgment, at page 824 described salami as the amount of money which a landlord "insists on receiving as a condition precedent for parting with the land in favour of the lessee." lie also held that salami (1) (1943) L.R. 70 I.A. 180, 190.
could not be treated as a revenue receipt and that it was received by the landlord "not because of the use of the land but before the land was put into use by the assessee." The same court in Province of Bihar v. Maharaja Protap Udai Nath Sahi Deo (1) followed the definition of the word 'salami' as given in Kumar Visheshwar Singh's case. Harries C.J. there held that where salami cannot be regarded as payment of rent in advance, it will not be income and would, therefore, not be taxable. He said "prima facie, salami is not income, and it is impossible upon the facts as stated to say that salamis received............... constitute part of his income."
Rankin C.J. in Re Gooptu Estate Limited (2) held payment of one lakh of rupees as salami not to be income. In that case it was demanded and paid in respect of resettlement of a lease which had still to run for 48 years but had been forfeited for the non-payment of rent.
(2) (1929) 50 C.L.J. 375.
exempt from income-tax under s. 2(a)(i) of the Indian Income Tax Act. As a matter of fact the assessee argued in that case that these sums constituted " agricultural income". Moreover the dictum the smaller the salami the higher the rent and vice-versa did not receive acceptance by the Federal Court when the present matter was heard in that court before remand (C.A. No. 30 of 1949). In Meher Bano Khanum v. Secretary of State for India(1) 'salami' was defined to be an amount received by the landlord for the recognition of the transfer of a non- transferable holding which was paid to the landlord because of his ownership of the land. It was held to be "agricultural income" as it was "rent or revenue" within the meaning of that expression. The Standing Counsel who appeared for the Secretary of State in that case conceded that it was not revenue but his argument was that it was not revenue derived from land but that it was an incident of the transfer and not of tenancy and therefore did not flow from the land. In neither of these cases was it argued whether salami was a revenue receipt or capital receipt. In a Full Bench of the Patna High Court in Raja Rajendra Narayan Bhanja Deo v. Commissioner of Income Tax (2 ) mutation fees were held to be agricultural income but that was a case of payment after the relationship of landlord and tenant had come into existence. Similarly in the Commissioner of Income Tax v. K. C. Manavikraman Rajah (3) monies paid for the renewal of leases were held to be agricultural income within the meaning of s. 2(1)(a) of the Indian Income Tax Act. Here again the monies were paid not for the constitution of the relationship of landlord and tenant but after that relationship had come into existence and for its continuance.
In H. H. Maharaja Sir Bir Bikram Kishore Manikya Bahadur v. The Province of Assam (1), a case under the Act, Harries C.J. referred to Kamakshya Narain Singh's case (5) and held that it had to be decided on (1)(1925) I.L.R. 53 Cal. 34.
the facts of each case whether salami was agricultural income or not because it was not known in respect of what transaction the amount was received.
The Orissa High Court in S. M. Bose v. Secretary, 'Board of Revenue (1) has held that salami is not a payment of rent in advance nor is it income but is a payment by way of capital receipt. It was contended before us that the Privy Council in Kamakshya Narain Singh's case (2 ) based its decision on the wasting nature of the assets under the lease. But the definition given by Lord Wright is in general terms and just describes what the characteristics of a payment by way of salami are without any reference as to the nature of assets under a lease.
In all these appeals before us the assessees derived considerably large amounts of income from agricultural holdings. It is not shown as to what the number of the holdings were but they must have been considerably large. On the other hand the number of settlements was comparatively small a few hundreds and consisted of settlements of virgin lands as well as of auction-purchase lands and were not derived from the same holdings at regular intervals. This and the findings of fact given above negative the finding as to "regularity and periodicity" of payment of salami and also that it "arose out of business of letting out his land." The payments by way of salami were made by the prospective lessees anterior to the constitution of the relationship of landlord and tenant as the price for the lessor agreeing to the parting of his rights in an agricultural holding in favour of the proposed lessee. In Principles of Mohamadan Law by Macnaughton ,salami is defined as;
In the Arabic-English Dictionary by Johnson it means:	Precedent
3. There was no eviction of tenants under section 69 of the Goalpara Tenancy Act, but action was taken in a large number of cases under section 68 of that Act.
Agricultural income" which, it is claimed by the Board comprises salami, has been defined in s. 2(a)(i) of the Act. The relevant portion of this section is:
The importance lies in the use of the words "the money paid to purchase it ", i.e., the right of the lessee to enjoy the benefits granted under the lease.
In certain cases, however, payment by way of salami has been held to be 'agricultural income'. In Birendra Kishore Manikya v. Secretary of State for India (3) it was held that the consideration for the grant of a lease is the capitalised value of the sum periodically payable along with the premium so that "the larger the one element the smaller the other." On this basis the premium paid for the settlement of waste lands or abandoned holdings was regarded as rent or revenue' derived from land and therefore within the definition of agricultural income in section 2(1)(a) of the Indian Income Tax Act. This was a case which was decided under the Indian Income Tax Act and the question whether it was a capital receipt or revenue receipt and therefore exempt or not from taxation did not arise because the Bengal Agricultural Income Tax Act was passed in 1944 and the Assam Act in 1939. It was not necessary for the purpose of that case to decide whether it was a capital receipt or revenue because what was to be decided was whether salami was (1) (1947) I.L.R. 20 Patna 699, 722.
