movements of the appellant between November 19, 1948, when he went to Karachi for the first time, and his arrest on February 26, 1955, as his movements during this period are not relevant in determining whether the appellant has committed an offence punishable under r. 6(a) of the Rules. The case must be decided on the footing that sometime before his arrest on February 26, 1955, the appellant entered India without a passport.	PetArg
(e). Article 19(1)(d) confers the fundamental right on all Indian citizens " to move freely throughout the territory of India" and Art. 19(1) (e) " to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India." This fundamental right, however, is subject .,,,.to reasonable restrictions under clause (5) of Art. 19. In the case of Ebrahim Vazir- Mavat v. The State of Bombay (supra)(1) the majority judgment of this Court held that an Indian citizen visiting Pakistan for any purpose whatsoever and returning to India may be required to produce a permit or a passport as the case may be before he can be allowed to enter India, and this requirement may well be regarded as a proper restriction upon entry. This Court, however, held that it was quite a different matter to say that if he enters India without a permit he may on conviction for such offence be ordered to be removed from India. It was the order directing his removal from India which was held by this Court to be tantamount to taking away his fundamental right guaranteed under Art. 19(1) (c), (1) [1954] S.C.R. 933.	Precedent
The Act was passed in 1920 and has been the subject of amendment and modification thereafter Its preamble states "
Rule 3 of the Rules states:
Two contentions were raised on behalf of the appellant (1) that r. 3 of the Rules and s. 3 of the Act were ultra vires the Constitution in so far as they purported to affect the right of an Indian citizen to enter India without a passport and (2) that on a proper interpretation of the provisions of s. 3 of the Act and r. 3 of the Rules, these provisions did not apply to an Indian citizen. They applied only to non- Indian citizens.
As to the first contention it was urged that s. 3 of the Act and r. 3 of the Rules in so far as they purported to relate to an Indian citizen were ultra vires the Constitution, as they offended against the provisions of Art. 19(1)(d) and
any person " and in r. 3 the words employed are "no person". Clause (b) of r. 4 obviously applies to Indian citizens but those mentioned in that clause have been specifically exempted from the operation of r. 3. Clause (h) of r. 4(1) can apply to Indian citizens who are by religion Mohomedan. They have been exempted. Therefore, on a reasonable interpretation of s. 3 of the Act and rr. 3 and 4 of the Rules there can be no manner of doubt that these provisions apply to all persons including Indian citizens.	Section
In our opinion, there can be no manner of doubt that the appellant's entry into India without a passport was in contravention of r. 3 of the Rules and therefore punishable under r. 6(a) and the appellant was rightly convicted. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.	Conclusion
