It is not necessary to particularize other defences as nothing turns upon them in the appeal. The learned Subordinate Judge held that the document created a usufructuary mortgage and not a lease and that s. 77 of the Transfer of Property Act applied to the document exonerating the appellant from any liability to render accounts. In the result, the learned Subordinate Judge gave a conditional decree in favour of respondents I to 4 for possession on their depositing in Court a sum of Rs. 26,839-7-0 within six months from the date of the decree. The plaintiff- respondents preferred an appeal against that decree to the High Court at Patna. The High Court agreed with the learned Subordinate Judge that the document was a sufructuary mortgage but differed from him on the question of applicability of s. 77 of the Transfer of Property Act. The High Court set aside the decree of the learned Subordinate Judge and passed instead a preliminary decree for redemption and sale on default of payment: the decree also directed the rendition of accounts between the parties in the light of the directions given in the judgment. The second defendant against whom the decree was passed preferred the above appeal.	Facts
On the footing that the mortgage is an anomalous mortgage, we arrive at the same result. The learned Counsel for the appellant contends that if the mortgage is an anomalous mortgage, the parties are only governed by the provisions of s. 98 of the Transfer of Property Act and not by the provisions of s. 77 of the Act. Section 98 says:	PetArg
The point to be first decided is whether the transaction is a lease as contended by the contesting respondents. The only guiding rule that can be extracted from the cases on the subject is that the intention of the parties must be looked into and that 'once you get a debt with security of land for its redemption, then the arrangement is a mortgage by whatever name it is called' (See Ghosh on Mortgages, V Edn., Vol. 1, p. 102). Let us now examine the terms of the document Exhibit A (3) to ascertain the intention of the parties. The document was obviously not drafted by a trained mind. It appears to be a confused product of one of those village document-writers. We shall read the document, omitting the recitals not material to the question raised: The first part of the document recited that the executant was heavily indebted to the other party under mortgage bonds and also otherwise and that common friends settled that a part of the properties mortgaged should be let out in ijara with possession at a lower rate of interest so that 'the increment of interest may be checked and the present necessities may be met ". It was also stated in the document that in respect of the said property there was a pre-existing thika (lease) dated April 21, 1922, in favour of Munshi Dodraj Lal alias Munshi Jatadhari Lal, for a period of 9 years and that under the said lease, Rs. 2,205 was taken by the executant as peshgi money without interest and the rent was fixed at a sum of Rs. 2,205. Then the document proceeds to state thus:
Even so, it was contended by the learned Counsel for the appellant that the document did not create an usufructuary mortgage but only an anomalous mortgage. This contention was raised as a foundation to the argument that if the document was an anomalous mortgage, the rights and liabilities of the parties would be governed by the terms of the contract between them and not by the provisions of s. 76 of the Transfer of Property Act. The question does not really fall to be decided in this case. Whether the transaction is a usufructuary mortgage or an anomalous mortgage, in the circumstances of the case, there will not be any difference in the matter of rendition of accounts, for in the ultimate analysis, as we would presently show, the true construction of the relevant terms of the document would afford an answer to the question raised. We shall, therefore, proceed to consider the question on the alternative basis.	RespArg
(a) of the Constitution of India is directed against the judgment and decree of the High Court of Judicature at Patna setting aside those of the Subordinate Judge, Gaya, in a suit for redemption of an usufructuary mortgage. Deokinand, the common ancestor of plaintiff-respondents 1 to 4 and proforma respondents 6 to 12, executed a document dated August 20, 1923, in favour of Mahant Tokhnarain Puri of Nadra, the predecessor-ininterest of defendant 1, hypothecating eight annas milkiat share in mauza Lodipur, Mahimabigha, Tauze No. 4246 for the purpose of discharging a debt of Rs. 31,701 payable by him to the Mahanth. There are conflicting versions in regard to the nature of this transaction-respondents claim it to be a usufructuary mortgage, while the appellant asserts it to be a lease.. The plaintiff-respondents instituted Title Suit No. 4 of 1945 in the Court of the Additional Subordinate Judge 1V, Gaya, for redemption of the said document on the basis that it was a usufructuary mortgage, for rendition of accounts and for the recovery of surplus profits due to them. The appellant pleaded, inter alia, that the suit for redemption was not maintainable as the document was not a mortgage but lease, that on the assumption that it was a mortgage it would only be an anomalous mortgage in respect where of there was no statutory liability to render accounts to the plaintiff, that even if it was a usufructuary mortgage, it was governed by the provisions of s. 77 of the Transfer of Property Act taking the mortgage out of the purview of s. 76 (d) and (g) of the said Act.
The document then allocates the liability in respect of improvements and sums spent in regard to boundary disputes to one or other of the parties to the document and then it continues to state:
The gist of the aforesaid transaction may be stated thus:
After mentioning the various terms, the executant restated the intention of the parties in the following terms:
The Judicial Committee, in Pandit Bachchu Lal v. Chaudhri Syed Mohammad Mah (1), held that notwithstanding the fact that a particular rate of interest was mentioned in the mortgage deed, there was a contract within the meaning of s. 77 of the Transfer of Property Act. It was a case of a mortgage with possession and a particular rate of interest was mentioned in the mortgage deed. There was a provision for repayment of the principal either in whole or in part before the stipulated period, but it was otherwise provided that the mortgagee should appropriate the surplus profits towards interest, he having no claim to interest and the mortgagors having no claim to the profits. The Privy Council held, on a construction of the mortgage deed, that the said deed contained a contract within the meaning of s. 77 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882.	Precedent
If it was a usufructuary mortgage, it is contended by the appellant that he was not liable to render accounts to the mortgagor, as, Linder the mortgage deed, he was authorized to take the receipts in lieu of interest within the meaning of s. 77 of the Transfer of Property Act. The relevant provisions of the Transfer of Property Act are as follows:	Section
parties are dealing with their rights after the expiry of the thikadari interest, but in more than one place they have stated in clear and unambiguous terms that the mortgagee could appropriate the produce towards interest and that the mortgagor would not put forward any sort of claim or demand in respect of any increase in the produce. In view of the clearly expressed intention of the parties, we cannot hold from the mere fact that the rate of interest is mentioned that the document does not come under the purview of s. 77 of the Transfer of Property Act. We hold that s. 77 of the Transfer of Property Act applies to the document and therefore the mortgagee is not liable to render any account to the mortgagor.	Conclusion

1958. May 23. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SUBBA RAO J.-This appeal by certificate tinder Art. 133 (1)
(a) of the Constitution of India is directed against the judgment and decree of the High Court of Judicature at Patna setting aside those of the Subordinate Judge, Gaya, in a suit for redemption of an usufructuary mortgage. Deokinand, the common ancestor of plaintiff-respondents 1 to 4 and proforma respondents 6 to 12, executed a document dated August 20, 1923, in favour of Mahant Tokhnarain Puri of Nadra, the predecessor-ininterest of defendant 1, hypothecating eight annas milkiat share in mauza Lodipur, Mahimabigha, Tauze No. 4246 for the purpose of discharging a debt of Rs. 31,701 payable by him to the Mahanth. There are conflicting versions in regard to the nature of this transaction-respondents claim it to be a usufructuary mortgage, while the appellant asserts it to be a lease.. The plaintiff-respondents instituted Title Suit No. 4 of 1945 in the Court of the Additional Subordinate Judge 1V, Gaya, for redemption of the said document on the basis that it was a usufructuary mortgage, for rendition of accounts and for the recovery of surplus profits due to them. The appellant pleaded, inter alia, that the suit for redemption was not maintainable as the document was not a mortgage but lease, that on the assumption that it was a mortgage it would only be an anomalous mortgage in respect where of there was no statutory liability to render accounts to the plaintiff, that even if it was a usufructuary mortgage, it was governed by the provisions of s. 77 of the Transfer of Property Act taking the mortgage out of the purview of s. 76 (d) and (g) of the said Act.
It is not necessary to particularize other defences as nothing turns upon them in the appeal. The learned Subordinate Judge held that the document created a usufructuary mortgage and not a lease and that s. 77 of the Transfer of Property Act applied to the document exonerating the appellant from any liability to render accounts. In the result, the learned Subordinate Judge gave a conditional decree in favour of respondents I to 4 for possession on their depositing in Court a sum of Rs. 26,839-7-0 within six months from the date of the decree. The plaintiff- respondents preferred an appeal against that decree to the High Court at Patna. The High Court agreed with the learned Subordinate Judge that the document was a sufructuary mortgage but differed from him on the question of applicability of s. 77 of the Transfer of Property Act. The High Court set aside the decree of the learned Subordinate Judge and passed instead a preliminary decree for redemption and sale on default of payment: the decree also directed the rendition of accounts between the parties in the light of the directions given in the judgment. The second defendant against whom the decree was passed preferred the above appeal.
The point to be first decided is whether the transaction is a lease as contended by the contesting respondents. The only guiding rule that can be extracted from the cases on the subject is that the intention of the parties must be looked into and that 'once you get a debt with security of land for its redemption, then the arrangement is a mortgage by whatever name it is called' (See Ghosh on Mortgages, V Edn., Vol. 1, p. 102). Let us now examine the terms of the document Exhibit A (3) to ascertain the intention of the parties. The document was obviously not drafted by a trained mind. It appears to be a confused product of one of those village document-writers. We shall read the document, omitting the recitals not material to the question raised: The first part of the document recited that the executant was heavily indebted to the other party under mortgage bonds and also otherwise and that common friends settled that a part of the properties mortgaged should be let out in ijara with possession at a lower rate of interest so that 'the increment of interest may be checked and the present necessities may be met ".

Then the document proceeds to state thus:
Then the document proceeds to incorporate the terms agreed upon by the parties, to take effect after the termination of the thikadari interest. It is stated:
The document then allocates the liability in respect of improvements and sums spent in regard to boundary disputes to one or other of the parties to the document and then it continues to state:
The gist of the aforesaid transaction may be stated thus:
After mentioning the various terms, the executant restated the intention of the parties in the following terms:
Therefore, whatever ambiguity there might be in the recitals that was dispelled by the unambiguous declaration made by the parties that the property was given as security for the loan and the document was executed as a mortgage. The gist of the document was not a letting of the premises, with a rent reserved, but a mortgage of the premises with a small portion of the income of it made payable to the plaintiff. There is, therefore, no scope for the argument in this case that the document is a lease and not a mortgage. We hold, agreeing with the High Court, that the document is a mortgage and not a lease.
Even so, it was contended by the learned Counsel for the appellant that the document did not create an usufructuary mortgage but only an anomalous mortgage. This contention was raised as a foundation to the argument that if the document was an anomalous mortgage, the rights and liabilities of the parties would be governed by the terms of the contract between them and not by the provisions of s. 76 of the Transfer of Property Act. The question does not really fall to be decided in this case. Whether the transaction is a usufructuary mortgage or an anomalous mortgage, in the circumstances of the case, there will not be any difference in the matter of rendition of accounts, for in the ultimate analysis, as we would presently show, the true construction of the relevant terms of the document would afford an answer to the question raised. We shall, therefore, proceed to consider the question on the alternative basis.
If it was a usufructuary mortgage, it is contended by the appellant that he was not liable to render accounts to the mortgagor, as, Linder the mortgage deed, he was authorized to take the receipts in lieu of interest within the meaning of s. 77 of the Transfer of Property Act. The relevant provisions of the Transfer of Property Act are as follows:
Section 76(g) of the Transfer of Property Act imposes a liability on a mortgagee to keep, full and accurate accounts supported by vouchers. So too, he is under a statutory liability under cl. 'h' to debit the nett receipts of the mortgaged property in deduction of the amount due to him from time to time on account of interest and where such receipts exceed any interest due, in reduction and discharge of the mortgagemoney and to pay the surplus, if any, to the mortgagor. Therefore, every mortgagee in possession is bound to keep clear, full and accurate accounts and to render the accounts to the mortgagor in the manner prescribed in cl. 'h'. But s. 77 enacts an exception to the mortgagee's liability under cls. (g) and (h) of s. 76. Under that section (s. 77), if there is a contract between the mortgagor and the mortgagee, whereunder it is agreed that the receipts of the mortgaged property should, so long as the mortgagee is in possession of the property, be taken in lieu of interest and a defined portion of the principal, the mortgagee is freed from the statutory liability to keep accounts or to render accounts to the mortgagor in the manner prescribed under cls. (g) and (h) of s. 76 of the Act. This is so because, the receipts are set off against the interest, and there is nothing to account for. Therefore, to insist upon the mortgagee to keep accounts or render accounts to the mortgagor would be an empty forma- lity. The essential condition for the application of this section is that the receipts of the property should be taken in lieu of interest or in lieu of interest and a defined portion of the principal. The contention of the learned counsel for the respondents is that unless the contract authorizes the mortgagee to take the entire receipts in lieu of interest or in lieu of interest and defined portions of principal, this section cannot be invoked; for it is said that the principle behind the section is that one is set off against the other, with the result, there is nothing to be accounted for, whereas if only a part of the receipts is agreed to be paid towards interest or in lieu of such interest and defined portions of the"-principal, there would be surplus in the hands of the mortgagee, which would have to be accounted for. On the basis of that distinction, an argument is advanced to the effect that, as in the present case, the mortgagee had to pay a sum of ]Is. 435-4-0 to the mortgagor, he was not authorized by the mortgagor tinder the agreement to take the entire receipts in lieu of interest, etc., within the meaning of s. 77 of the Transfer of Property Act. To put it differently, the argument is that out of the receipts from the mortgaged property a portion was paid to the mortgagor and the mortgagee was authorized to take only the balance in lieu of interest and, therefore, there was no contract between the mortgagor and the mortgagee for the latter taking the entire receipts in lieu of interest. We find it difficult to accept this argument. Under Exhibit A(3), the mortgagee undertook an unconditional obligation to pay a sum of Rs. 435-4-0 in respect of the property mortgaged to him. This obligation was not made to depend upon the receipts from the property in the possession of the mortgagee. Whether there was yield from the land or not, he had to make the payment to the mortgagor. Though he had to pay the rent as a consideration for his enjoyment of the land as a mortgagee, his liability did not depend upon the receipts from the land-he had to pay, receipts or no receipts. His liability was also not confined to the receipts, for he was under a personal obligation to pay the amount to the mortgagor. On the other hand, the mortgagee was expressly authorized to take the entire income from the land and appropriate the same towards interest and the mortgagor agreed not to put forward any claim or demand in respect of any increase in the produce. Shortly stated, the mortgagee was under a personal obligation to pay Rs. 435-4-0 to the mortgagor and had a right to take the entire receipts from the land in lieu of interest. It is not a case, therefore, where receipts from the mortgaged property are divided between mortgagor and mortgagee, but one where the mortgagee pays a specified amount to the mortgagor and appropriates the entire receipts in lieu of interest. We, therefore, hold that, under the mortgage deed, Exhibit A(3), there is a contract between the mortgagee and the mortgagor within the meaning of s. 77 of the Transfer of Property Act, to the effect that the receipts from the mortgaged property should be taken in lieu of interest.
Relying upon the judgment of the High Court, a further attempt was made by the learned Counsel for the respondents to contend that the mention of a specified rate of interest in the document is indicative of the fact that under the document the mortgagee, would have to take only such part of the nett receipts sufficient to discharge the interest and credit the balance to the mortgagor. The mere mention of a rate of interest does not necessarily lead to the conclu- sion. The rate of interest may be stipulated for estimating the amount payable towards interest so that the parties may visualize whether the nett receipts could reasonably be set off against the interest. The rate may also be given for other reasons.
The Judicial Committee, in Pandit Bachchu Lal v. Chaudhri Syed Mohammad Mah (1), held that notwithstanding the fact that a particular rate of interest was mentioned in the mortgage deed, there was a contract within the meaning of s. 77 of the Transfer of Property Act. It was a case of a mortgage with possession and a particular rate of interest was mentioned in the mortgage deed. There was a provision for repayment of the principal either in whole or in part before the stipulated period, but it was otherwise provided that the mortgagee should appropriate the surplus profits towards interest, he having no claim to interest and the mortgagors having no claim to the profits. The Privy Council held, on a construction of the mortgage deed, that the said deed contained a contract within the meaning of s. 77 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882.
In Exhibit A-3, though the rate of interest is stated at i per cent. per month, it was obviously mentioned to enable the parties to approximately fix the amount to be appropriated by the mortgagee from and out of the rent received from the thikadar. No doubt, the same rate of interest is also mentioned when the (1) (1933) 37 C.W.N. 457.
parties are dealing with their rights after the expiry of the thikadari interest, but in more than one place they have stated in clear and unambiguous terms that the mortgagee could appropriate the produce towards interest and that the mortgagor would not put forward any sort of claim or demand in respect of any increase in the produce. In view of the clearly expressed intention of the parties, we cannot hold from the mere fact that the rate of interest is mentioned that the document does not come under the purview of s. 77 of the Transfer of Property Act. We hold that s. 77 of the Transfer of Property Act applies to the document and therefore the mortgagee is not liable to render any account to the mortgagor.
On the footing that the mortgage is an anomalous mortgage, we arrive at the same result. The learned Counsel for the appellant contends that if the mortgage is an anomalous mortgage, the parties are only governed by the provisions of s. 98 of the Transfer of Property Act and not by the provisions of s. 77 of the Act.
