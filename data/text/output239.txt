D.K. Nabhirajiah vs The State Of Mysore And Others on 26 May, 1952	Case Title
ORIGINAL JURISDICTION: Petition No. 297 of 1951. Petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution of India for enforcement of fundamental rights by quashing the orders of the Deputy Commissioner and House Rent Controller, Banga- lore, allotting the petitioner's house to the 3rd respondent and for taking forcible possession of the same. S.K. Venkataranga Iyengar for the petitioner. A.R. Somanatha Iyer, Advocate-General of Mysore, (R. Ganapathy Iyer, with him) for the respondent No. 1. K. Ramaseshayya Chowdhury for the respondent No. 2. 1952. May 26 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.--This is an application under article 32 of the Constitution for quashing the orders of the Deputy Commissioner and House Rent Controller, Banga- lore, (2nd respondent) allotting house No. 291, Fifth Main Road, Gandhi Nagar, Bangalore City, for the use of Sri Aswathanarayana Rao (3rd respondent) and taking forcible possession of the same. The State of Mysore has been im- pleaded as the first respondent, The facts are these. The petitioner D.K. Nabhirajiah is a merchant and is the owner of the premises aforesaid. After lengthy litigation, the previous tenant of the premises vacated it on 1st September, 1949. On 2nd Septem- ber, 1949, the petitioner notified the vacancy to the 2nd respondent as required by law but added that he wanted the premises for his own use to set up one.of his grown-up sons in a business in electrical goods. The third respondent Aswathanarayana Rao however wanted the house for a chil- dren's school which he was running under the name of Bala Mandir and so he not only applied to the Rent Controller for allotting to him that house but also moved the Minister for Law and 'Labour for the same purpose.	Issue
By an order dated 20th September, 1949, made on an appli- cation by the petitioner dated 16th September, 1949, the Deputy Commissioner refused to reconsider the allotment and required the petitioner to give effect to the same at once and deliver possession to the allottee, The petitioner preferred an appeal to the Commissioner of Labour who is the House Rent Control Appellate Authority and obtained a stay, but the appeal was eventually dismissed and the said order vacated on 28th December. 1949. He filed a Revision Petition No. 97 of 1949-50 before the Government of Mysore but without success and the Government declined to interfere by their order dated 14th March, 1950. He then resorted to the High Court of Mysore by means of a petition under section 45 of the Mysore Specific Relief Act. This again was dismissed on the ground that the party who seeks to obtain an order under the said section cannot do so on the allegation that the statute which enjoins the doing or for bearing of the act is itself illegal or ultra vires. Applications moved under article 226 of the Constitution in the course of the same proceedings also failed. This was on 5th January, 1951.
Some intermediate steps may now be set out. The third respondent complained that he had not been given possession. On this complaint, the second respondent passed an order on the 20th March, 1950, to the following effect :--
The petitioner lodged a protest against this order pointing out that the House Rent Accommodation Control Order did not vest the Controller with jurisdiction to allot the house, but on 23rd March, 1950, he received the following reply:--
On 11th April, 1950, the second respondent made the following order:--
The petitioner seeks to quash the above-mentioned orders of the second respondent dated 20th September, 1949, 20th March, 1950, 23rd March, 1950, and 11th April, 1950. The prayer in the petition is thus worded: --	Facts
The contention of the petitioner is a threefold one, namely :--	PetArg
As this order was not obeyed by the petitioner, forcible possession was taken of the house with police help and the third respondent was given possession.	RespArg
The second respondent made an order on 13th September, 1949, in the following terms:
To this sub-clause, a proviso was added by a notification to the following effect:
al.
Whether retrospective effect could be given to article 13 (1) of the Constitution arose for decision in Keshavan Madhava Menon v. The State of Bombay(1). Dealing with the argument that the said article rendered voidab initio and for all purposes an earlier law which was inconsistent with fundamental rights, it was laid down by this Court in that case "that such laws existed for all past transactions and for enforcing all rights and liabilities accrued before the date of the Constitution." (Per Das J., at page 234). Mr. Justice Mahajan observed at pages 249 and 250:--	Precedent
spondent contravenes the provisions of article 31, sub- clause (2) and article 19 (1} (f) of the Constitution. (2) The order is discriminatory and offends article 14 of the Constitution.
(3) Under the Defence of India Rules under which the Accommodation Control Order was made, the allotment can only be of houses available for letting.
It will be convenient here to set out the relevant legis- lative provisions. The Mysore House Rent and Accommodation Control Order, 1948, (hereinafter referred to for the sake of convenience as the Control Order) was made in exercise of the powers conferred by clause (bb) of sub-rule (2) of Rule 81 of the Defence of India Rules as applied to Mysore, and it came into force with effect from 1st July, 1948. Clause 3 of the Control Order provides, subject to two exceptions, for notice being given by the landlord to the Controller within seven days after a house becomes vacant. Subclause (2), as it originally stood, was in the following terms :--
ince or State, or of any local authority or public body, or of any educational or other public institution for the occupation of any officer of any such Government authority, body or institu- tion, the landlord shall be at liberty to let the house to any tenant, or if the Controller, on application made by the landlord permits the landlord to do so, to occupy the house himself."
By a notification dated 4th May, 1949, the words: "or for the occupation of any individual" were added after the words "body or institution" in the said sub-section. The sub-clause as amended runs thus:
ince or State, or of any local authority or public body, or of any educational or other public institution, or for the occupation of any officer of any such Government authority. body or institution or for the occupation of any individual, the landlord shall be at liberty to let the house to any tenant, or if the Controller on application made by the landlord, permits the landlord to do so, to occupy the house himself."
Sub-clause (8) says :--
Then comes sub-clause (4) which reads as follows :--
session of the house to the Government authority, body or institution concerned and such Government authority or body or institution shall be deemed to be the tenant of the landlord, with retrospective effect from the date on which the Controller received notice under sub-clause (1), the terms of the tenancy being such as may be agreed upon be- tween the landlord and, the tenant:
Article31 (2)does not apply for another reason. There was no acquisition by the State of the house. The taking of possession can only be from a person who is entitled to possession. The petitioner landlord lost his right to possession by reason of the Controller's order. As soon as the allotment is made, the allottee becomes a tenant and the owner becomes the landlord by reason of sub-clause (4)of the Control Order and the learned Advocate-General of the Mysore State contended that a statutory tenancy was thereby created. It is no doubt true that it is provided by sub-clause (4) that the terms of the tenancy may be such as may be agreed upon between the landlord and the tenant, and there is no provision, as found in the later Act, as to what is to happen in the event of there being no agreement. If it is correct that a tenancy is brought into existence by the operation of the statute, it is possible that in case the terms are not the subject of any agreement between the landlord and the tenant, the ordinary law of landlord and tenant will apply in the absence of any provision for the fixation of terms by the Controller. But the point does not arise for decision in this case and nothing. further need be said about it.
The applicability of sub-clause (4) of the Control Order was sought to be avoided in another manner. It was pointed out that sub-clause (2) referred in its first part "to the purposes of the Government of Mysore" etc., and in its later part "for the occupation of any officer or any such Govern- ment authority, body or corporation, or for the occupation of an individual", but that when we come to sub-clause (4), the two categories are kept distinct or separate and in referring to the second category the Control Order speaks only of the requirement of the house for the occupa- tion by any of the officers and nothing is said about the occupation of any individual. The amending Act did not introduce the words "or for the occupation of any individu- al" into sub-clause (4). Therefore, it was urged that the whole basis of the Advocate-General's contention about a statutory tenancy being created fell to the ground. At first sight, there seems to be something in the point. But if sub-clause (2) is read as a whole, having in 'view the object sought to be achieved by the legislation, it is fairly clear that there is no such necessary antithesis between the two categories or clauses and that the words "for the purposes" can be so read as to include "occupation" also. 'the omission of the words "for the purposes" in the latter part of sub-clause (2) was perhaps to avoid inartis- tic phraseology. "For the occupation" certainly reads better than "for the purposes of the occupation". Ground No. 2 regarding discrimination was not pressed. Then, we come to ground No 3. Clause (bb) of sub-clause (2) of Rule 81 of the Defence of India Rules is in these terms:--
(iii) for requiring such accommodation to be let either generally, or to specified persons or classes of persons, or in specified circumstances; .... ,"	Section
((ii) for preventing the eviction of tenants and sub- tenants from such 'accommodation in specified circumstances and);	Conclusion

al.
The answer to the first contention based on article 31 (2) or article 19(1) (I) of the Constitution is a short one. The Constitution came into force on the 26th January, 1950, after the impugned orders were made and at a time when there was nothing like a chapter of Fundamental Rights. The argu- ment that the requisition in the present case was not for any public purpose and the restriction on the respondent to hold property must be in the interests of the general public presupposes that the Constitution governs the case. This assumption, however, is not well-founded. The order of allotment was made before the Constitution came into force and at a time when the Control Order provided, validly, that a house could be taken for the occupation of a private individual. During the period of 10 days specified in sub- clause (2), the landlord could not let the house or occupy it himself, and on allotment, he was bound to deliver up possession to the allottee. His rights as landlord were thus at an end so far as possession was concerned.
Whether retrospective effect could be given to article 13 (1) of the Constitution arose for decision in Keshavan Madhava Menon v. The State of Bombay(1). Dealing with the argument that the said article rendered voidab initio and for all purposes an earlier law which was inconsistent with fundamental rights, it was laid down by this Court in that case "that such laws existed for all past transactions and for enforcing all rights and liabilities accrued before the date of the Constitution." (Per Das J., at page 234). Mr. Justice Mahajan observed at pages 249 and 250:--
dispossession took 'place on 11-4-1950. This, however, is no answer. The dispossession was a mere consequence which followed under clause '3, sub-clause (6) of the Control Order. The right to possession was lost earlier and the landlord merely held on to the property.
Article31 (2)does not apply for another reason. There was no acquisition by the State of the house. The taking of possession can only be from a person who is entitled to possession. The petitioner landlord lost his right to possession by reason of the Controller's order. As soon as the allotment is made, the allottee becomes a tenant and the owner becomes the landlord by reason of sub-clause (4)of the Control Order and the learned Advocate-General of the Mysore State contended that a statutory tenancy was thereby created. It is no doubt true that it is provided by sub-clause (4) that the terms of the tenancy may be such as may be agreed upon between the landlord and the tenant, and there is no provision, as found in the later Act, as to what is to happen in the event of there being no agreement.
