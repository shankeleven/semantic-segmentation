CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 105 of 1950. Appeal from the Judgment and Order dated March 22, 1945, of the Court of the Judicial Commissioner, Ajmer-Merwara, Ajmer (Davies J. C.) in Civil First Appeal No. 16 of 1944, arising out of the Judgment and Decree dated March 13, 1944, of the Court of the Judge, Small Causes, Ajmer, and Additional District Judge, Ajmer, in Civil Suit No. 28 of 1942. S. S. Deedwania for the appellant.
M. C. Setalvad, Attorney-General for India, (J. N, Sharma, with him) for the respondents, 1952. November 10. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MAHAJAN'J.-This is an appeal by special leave granted by the Privy Council and limited to the question of court-fee, viz., whether the memorandum of appeal presented to the High Court court-fee was payable under section 7 (iv) (e) or article 17 of Schedule II of the Court-Fees Act. The question whether the memorandum of appeal was properly stamped arose in the following circumstances: Edward-Mills Co. Ltd. is a joint stock company situate in Beawar, Ajmer- Merwara. In accordance with the provisions of the articles of the company one Seth Gadh Mal Lodha and Rai Sahib Moti Lal (respondent No. 2) were its chairman and managing director respectively since 1916. Seth Gadh Mal Lodha represented his family 'firm of Kanwal Nain Hamir Singh, while Rai Sahib Moti Lal represented the joint family firm of Champa Lal Ram Swaroop, 1st July, 1938, Rai Sahib Moti Lal and his firm were adjudged insolvents by the Bombay High Court. The result was that respondent No. 2 had to vacate the office of managing director and -the members of his firm also became ineligibleforit. By a resolution of the board of direetors passed 18th July, 1938, Gadh Mal Lodha was appointed to take the place of Rai Sahib Moti Lal as managing director. Gadh Mal Lodha died llth January, 1942, and the board of directors then appointed Seth
The plaint bore a court-fee stamp of Rs. 10 only, but the objection of the respondents that court-fee was payable relief No. 2 the appellants paid ad valorem fee Rs. 51,000 which was the valuation of the suit for purposes of jurisdiction.
The reasons for demanding additional court-fee, though not mentioned in the original order, are stated in this order. The question for determination in this appeal is whether the order of the Judicial Commissioner demanding additional court-fee can be sustained in law. A memorandum of appeal, as provided in article 1 of Schedule I of the Court-Fees Act, has to be stamped according to the value of the subject-matter in dispute in appeal; in other words, the relief claimed in the memorandum of appeal determines the value of the appeal for purposes of court-fee. The only relief claimed in the memorandum of appeal was the first one mentioned in the plaint. This relief being purely of a declaratory character, the memorandum of appeal was properly stamped under article 17 of Schedule II It is always open to the appellant in appeal to give up a portion of his claim and to restrict it. It is further open to him; unless the relief is of such a nature that it cannot be split up, to relinquish a part of the claim and to bring it within the amount of court-fee already paid: Brahnmnandam v. Secretary of State for India(1); Ram Prasad v. Bhiman(2); Karam Chand v. Jullundur Bank Ltd(1); Neelachalam v. Nara- singha Das(4); Sah Bamehand v. Pannalal(5); Chuni Lal v. Sheo Charanlat Lalman(1). The plaintiffs in express terms relinquished the second relief,they had claimed in the plaint, in their memorandum of appeal. For the purpose of deciding whether the memorandum of appeal was properly stamped according to the subjectmatter of the appeal, it was not open to the Judicial Commissioner to canvass the question whether the suit with the second prayer eliminated from it fell within the mischief of the proviso to section 42 of the Specific Relief Act. That was a question which related to the merits of the appeal and did not concern its proper institution this ground, therefore, the Judicial Commissioner had no jurisdiction to demand (I) (1930) I.L.R. 53 Mad. 48 (2) (1905) I.L.R. 27 All. 151.	Issue
-Sobhagmal Lodha to act as chairman as well as managing director till the, appointment was made by the company. An extraordinary meeting of the company was called for the 8th February, 1945, for the election of the chairman. At this meeting conflict &rose between the two groups represented by Sobhagmal Lodha and Moti Lal. The chairman therefore dissolved the meeting but the supporters of Moti Lal continued to hold it and passed a resolution appointing him as the sole agent and chairman for a period of twenty years a remuneration equal to ten per cent of the profits of the company It-is this resolution of the 8th February, 1942, which has led to the present dispute.
Seth Sobhagmal in the situation that arose approached the District Judge of Ajmer with the prayer that a general meeting of the company may be held under the supervision of the court. This request was allowed 11th February, 1942, and the court ordered that the meeting be held 12th February, 1942, under the chairmanship of Seth Sobhagmal. Respondent No. 2 being aggrieved by this order, filed an ap- plication in revision in the Court of the 'judicial Commissioner impugning the order. The learned Judicial Commissioner allowed the revision and directed that the resolution of the 8th February, 1942, should be acted upon. Having failed to get redress in the summary proceedings, the appellant then filed the suit out of which this appeal arises for quashing the resolution of the 8th February, 1942. In the plaint he asked for the following relies:-
The Additional District Judge dismissed the suit the preliminary ground that it was not maintainable as it related to the internal management of the company and that the, appellants had no right to bring it without impleading the directors who were necessary parties to it.
Aggrieved by this decision of the trials Judge, the appellants preferred an appeal to the Court of the Judicial Commissioner, Ajmer-Merwara, at Ajmer. The memorandum of appeal was Stamped with a courtfee stamp of Rs. 1 0 and it was expressly stated therein that relief No. 2 of the plaint was given up. An objection was raised regarding the amount of courtfee paid the memorandum of appeal. The Judicial Commissioner ordered that proper court-fees be paid thereon in a month. In this order no reasons were given for this decision. The additional fee demanded was not paid, and the Judicial Commissioner dismissed the appeal with costs 22nd March, 1945. An application was made for leave to appeal to the Privy Council against this order but, it was refused. In the order refusing leave it was said as follows:-	Facts
additional fee from the plaintiffs and the appeal could not be dismissed for failure to meet it. We are thus of the opinion that the order demanding additional court-fee the memorandum of appeal as it stood,' that is, minus the second prayer, was erroneous and we hold that the memorandum of appeal was properly stamped, as the subject-matter of the appeal was purely of a declaratory character. Mr. Setalvad for the respondents contended that the first relief claimed in the plaint, and which was the subject- matter of the appeal included within it consequential relief and was not purely declaratory in nature and therefore the Judicial Commissioner was right in demanding additional court-fee the value of the consequential relief. It was said that the words that respondent No. 2 "had no right to act as chairman and managing director" amounted to a claim for consequential relief. We are unable to agree. The claim contained in the first relief of the plaint is to the effect that it be declared that defendant No. 2 has no right to act as chairman an managing director because of his appointment being illegal, invalid, and ultra vires. The declaration claimed is in negative form that defendant No. 2 has no right to act as chairman and managing director. No claim for a consequential relief can be read within this prayer. The words "that defendant 2 has no right to act as chairman.......'' are mere repetition and reiteration of what is contained in the opening sentence of the paragraph. This contention of Mr. Setalvad, therefore, cannot be sustained.	RespArg

It was next contended that in view of the provisions of section 12 of the Court-Fees Act it should be held that the decision of the Judicial Commissioner' was final, and could not be challenged in appeal. Section 12 of the Court-Fees Act enacts as follows:
An order rejecting a plaint is a decree as defined in section 2; sub-section (ii), and is appealable as such. There is an apparent conflict between the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure and the provisions of section 12 which make the order relating to valuation final and efforts to reconcile the provisions of the Court-Fees Act and the Code have resulted in some divergence of judicial opinion the construction of the section. In a number of decisions the Calcutta High Court took the view that the finality declared by section 12 of the Court-Fees Act had been taken away by the relevant provisions of the Code, as the order rejecting a plaint was appealable as a decree, no matter whether the dispute related to the category under which the same falls for purposes of court-fee or only to valuation pure and simple under a particular category: Vide In re Omrao Mirza v. Mary Jones(,) and Tara Prasanna Chongdar v. Nrisingha Moorari Pal(1). This extreme view has not been maintained in later decisions and it has been held that the finality declared by section 12 is limited only to the question (1883) 12 C.L.R. 148.
of valuation pure and simple and does not relate to the category under which a certain suit falls: Tariman Khatun v. Secretary o State for India in Council(1). The Allahabad High Court in its earlier decisions took the extreme view:
later decision in Narasimhalu Chetty v. Bamayya Naidu(1), the decision of the Full Bench was explained as not in any way overruling the decision in Lakshmi Amma v. Janamajayam Nambiar(2). All recent decisions of the Bombay High Court have taken the same view: Vide Dada v. Nagesh(3); Krishnaji Bari Dhandhere v. Gopal Narain Dhandhere(4). Mr. Setalvad drew our attention to an earlier decision of the Bombay High Court in Vithal Krishna v. Balakrishna Janardan(5). In that case the court undoubtedly held that no appeal lay and the finality declared by section 12 was comprehensive enough to include all questions whether relating to category or valuation pure and simple. It was, however, held that the High Court could correct an erroneous decision in the exercise of its revisional powers. Thus the finality declared by section 12 was destroyed by the exercise of powers of appeal under the guise of exercising revisional jurisdiction. In Patna and Oudh the game view has been taken as in Lahore. Vide Chandramoni Koer v. Basdeo Narain Singh (6); Gumani v. Banwari(7). It thus appears that the consensus of judicial opinion is against the construction suggested by Mr. Setalvad. We think that the construction given to the language in section 12 in these decisions is right, and our reasons for saying so are these:	Precedent

Seth Sobhagmal in the situation that arose approached the District Judge of Ajmer with the prayer that a general meeting of the company may be held under the supervision of the court.
