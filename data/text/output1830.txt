Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated the February 4, 1957, of the Punjab High Court (Circuit Bench) at Delhi in Criminal Appeal No. 173-C of 1956. T. C. Arathur, P. C. Mathur and A. N. Goyal, for the Appellants.
It is necessary to state the following facts in order to bring out the question of law to be determined in. this case. The appellant was an upper Division Clerk in the office of the Chief Commissioner of Delhi. 'He had come to know (1) [1959] Supp. 2. S.C.R. 739.	Issue
his licence was cancelled and he was called upon to show cause why he should not be prosecuted for having made a false statement. Ram Narain made his representation to the authorities and showed cause against the action proposed to be taken against him, alleging that his monthly salary had been falsely declared in the 'relevant form for application for the firearm on the advice of the appellant. The prosecution story further is that when Ram Narain got into the trouble, as aforesaid, about the false statement in his application form, he again approached the appellant. The appellant' demanded another Rs. 180 as a reward for his getting the licence restored. Ultimately, Ram Narain agreed to pay the appellant Rs. 90 in advance and promised to pay the remaining Rs. 90 after the licence had actually been restored to him. Ram Narain for reasons of his own, appeared to have approached his superior officers and thus the matter reached the Chief Fire Officer, who appraised the police of the proposed illegal transaction between Ram Narain and the appellant. The police decided to lay a trap for catching the appellant red-handed. Accordingly, Ram Narain saw the appellant in the Chief Commissioner's office and accompanied him to the canteen run by Kishorilal, who has been examined as Defence Witness 1 This canteen is situated on the Alipore Road near the Chief Commissioner's office. There, Sarwan Singh a taxi driver, and Head Constable Gurbachan Singh in plain clothes, who were examined as prosecution witnesses, were present by arrangement. Ram Narain handed over the ninety rupees, which he had been given by the police, to the appellant. On the prearranged signal being given by Sarwan Singh, Inspector Surendra Pal Singh Prosecution Witness 16, at once entered the canteen. At that time the appellant, suspecting that he was being trapped, attempted to hand over the money received by him from Ram Narain to Kishorilal, the proprietor of the canteen The head constable Gurbacban Singh, however, seized the accused and prevented him from handing over the currency notes to Kishorilal. That is the story which was recited in the First Information Report drawn up in the. Civil Lines Police Station at 2-30 P.m. that very day, August 5, 1954. After investigation by a competent police officer tinder permission from the Magistrate, the appellant was placed on his trial before Shri Jawala. Dass, Special Judge Delhi. He framed the following charge against him.	Facts
Ram Narain, who is the chief prosecution witness in this case and who is a fireman serving in Delhi Fire Brigade. Ram Narain, aforesaid, had for a long time been anxious to obtain a licence for a double-barrelled shotgun. It is alleged that in this connection he bad sought the assistance of the appellant who had nothing to do with the issuing of licences for firearms, which is done by the office of the Deputy Commissioner, Delhi. The prosecution story, which, as indicated above, rests mainly on the statement of Ram Narain, is that he had submitted 'two applications during the year 1953 for the, purpose of obtaining the licence aforesaid, with the assistance of the appellant. These applications did not produce any results. In .1954, he made another attempt in the same direction and approached the appellant to help him. The appellant held out hopes of success in obtaining the licence if he was paid Rs. 250. Ram Narain paid only Rs. 140 and held out a promise to pay the amount after his sister's marriage. Thus, the third application for the licence was made in which Rain Narain's salary was declared to be Rs. 105 per month. This third attempt proved successful and Ram Narain was granted the necessary licence. Before the: learned single Judge of the High Court in Delhi, before whom the case came, up on appeal, it was not disputed that the appellant had used his good offices in expediting and furthering the progress of the application in the appropriate department. It appears that eventually the authorities concerned were appraised of the fact that the salary of Ram Narain was only Rs. 85 per month and that the declaration in the form that his salary was Rs. 105 per month bad been falsely made with a view to get over the difficulty that applications for licences for firearms by Government servants drawing less than Rs. 100 per month would not ordinarily be considered. When the authorities came to know- the true facts about Ram Narain's status in Government service.	PetArg
B. K. Khanna and T. M. Sen, for the Respondents. 1961. August 24. ;,The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SINHA, C. J.-This appeal was first heard by a Division Bench of three judges, composed of the Chief Justice, Imam and Shah, JJ., on the 19th of February last year. In the course of the argument, the learned counsel for the appellant invited the attention of the Court to the decision of a Division Bench of this Court in the State of Ajmer v. Shivji Lal (1).

ments in the Running Shed at Abu Road. There would, therefore, be no question of his committing misconduct in the discharge of his duty when he took money for procuring a job for Prem Singh in the Running Shed. so far, therefore, as the charge under s. 5(1)(d) is concerned, we are of opinion that there was no question of the accused misconducting himself in the discharge of his own duty in the circumstances of this case and it must fail." The relevant portion of s. 5 of the Act is in these terms :
(d) that follow as descriptive of an essential and additional ingriedent of each of the types of offence in the four sub-clauses. That that is the source of the mistake is apparent from the erroneous way in which the section has been quoted at p.744 of hte Supreme Court Report, in the aragraph preceedomg the paragarph quoted above. The ingredients of the particular offence in cl.(d) of s.5 (1) of the ACt are;(1) that he should be a public servant (2) that he should use some corrupt or illegal means or otherwise abouse his position as a public servant;(3) that he should have thereby obtained a valuable thing or pecuniery advantage; and (4) for himself or for any other person. In order to bring the charge [1959] Supp. 2 S.C.R. 739 home to an accused person under cl. (d) aforesaid of the section, it is not necessary that the public servant in question, while misconducting himself should have done so in the discharge of his duty. It would be anomalous to say that a public servant has misconducted himself in the discharge of his duty. "Duty" and ",misconduct" go ill together. If a person has misconducted himself as a public servant, it would not ordinarily be in the discharge of his duty, but the reverse of it. That `misconduct', which has been made criminal by s. 5 of the Act, does not contain the element of discharge of his duty, by public servant, is also made clear by reference to the provisions of cl. (c) of s. 5 (1). It is well settled that if a public servant dishonestly or fraudulently misappropriates property entrusted to him, he cannot be said to have been doing so in the discharge of his official duty (vide the case of Hori Ram Singh v. The Crown (1). An application for special leave to appeal from that decision was refused by the Privy Council in Hori Ram Singh v. The King-Emperor (2). This Court therefore, misread the section when it observed that the offence consists in criminal misconduct in the discharge of official duty. The error lies in importing the description of the offence into the definition portion of it. It is not necessary to constitute the offence under el. (d) of the section that the public servant must do something in connection with his own duty and thereby obtain any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage. It is equally wrong to say that if a public servant were to take money from a third person, by corrupt or illegal means or otherwise abusing his official position, in order to corrupt some other public servant, without there being any question of his misconducting himself in the dis- charge of his own duty, he has not committed an offence under s. 5(1)(d). It is also erroneous to hold that the essence of an offence under s. 5 (2), read with a. 5(1) (d), is that the public servant (1) [1939] F.C.R. 159.	Precedent
I, Jawala Dass, Special Judge, Delhi, hereby charge you (Dhaneshwar Narain) son of Babu Lakshmi Narain resident of 21, Todar Mal Lane, New Delhi as follows:
It will be observed that the heading of S. 5 is ,Criminal misconduct in the discharge of official duty'. That is a new offence which was created by the Act, apart from and in addition to offences under the Indian Penal Code, like those under ds.161 etc. The legislature advisedely widended the scope of the crime by giving by giving a very wide definition in s.5 wiht a view to punish those who holding public office and taking advantage of their official position obtain any valuable thing or pecuniary advantage. The necessary ingredient of an offence under s. 161, Indian Penal Code, is the clause as a motive or reward for doing or forbearing to do any official act or for showing or forbearing to show in the exercise of his official functions favour or disfavour to any person or for rendering or attempting to render any service or dis-service to any person with the Central or any State Government or Parliament or the Legislature of any State or wiht any public servent."But it need not be there in order to bring an offence under s.5 of the Act home to the accused . the offence under s.16, indian penal code . The words in the discharge of his duty" do not constitute an essential ingredient of the offence. The mistake in the judgemnt of this court in the aforsaid ruling in the State of Ajmer v.

These observations dispose of the present appeal and it must be held that there is no merit in the contentions raised in support of the appeal. As the only point raised in support of the appeal fails, it is accordingly dismissed. Appeal dismissed.	Conclusion

person was a school teacher and the charge against him was that he had promised to the giver of the money to secure a job for him in the Railway Running Shed at Mount Abu., It was not a part of his duty to make any such appointment and therefore, when he took the money for procuring a job for the complainant, he could not be convicted for committing misconduct within the meaning of s. 5 (2) of the Act.
