N. C. Chatterji (I. N. Shroff, with him) for the appellant.
The learned Judicial Commissioner refused to issue the writ but granted leave to appeal under article 132(1) of the Constitution in the following terms:	Issue
The leave is confined to the vires of the Regulation and the bye-laws but we allowed the appellant to attack the, validity of the District Magistrate's action as well. It is admitted that the land on which the fair is normally held belongs to the appellant. That being so, he has a fundamental right under article 19(1)(f) which can only be restricted in the manner permitted by sub-clause (5). The holding of an annual fair is an occupation or business within the meaning of article 19 (1) (g), therefore, the appellant also has a fundamental right to engage in that occupation on his land provided it does not infringe any law imposing "reasonable restrictions on that right in the interests of the general public", or any law "relating to-	PetArg
Porus A. Mehta and P. G. Gokhale for the respondents. 1954. December 3. The judgment of Mehr Chand Mahajan C.J., Mukherjea, Vivian Bose, Bhagwati and Venkatarama Ayyar JJ. was delivered by Bose J. The judgment of Das and Jagannadhadas JJ. was delivered by Jagannadhadas J. BOSE J.-The appellant is the Istimrardar of Kharwa. According to him, be has held a cattle fair on his estate every year for some twenty years. On 8-1-1951 the Chief Commissioner of Ajmer framed certain rules for the regulation of cattle and other fairs in the State of Ajmer. He purported to do this under sections 40 and 41 of the Ajmer Laws Regulation of 1877 (Reg. III of 1877). One of the rules required that persons desiring to hold fairs should obtain a permit from the District Magistrate. Accordingly the appellant applied for a permit. This was refused on the ground that no more permits were to be issued to private individuals. The appellant thereupon applied under article 226 of the Constitution to the Judicial Commissioner's Court at Ajmer for the issue of a writ directing the authorities concerned to permit the appellant to hold his fair as usual. He contended that his fundamental rights under the Constitution were infringed and also that the rules promulgated by the Chief Commissioner were ultra vires the Regulation under which he purported to act.
lation in at least two respects. The Regulation empowers the Chief Commissioner to make rules for the establishment of a system of conservancy and sanitation. He can only do this by bringing a system into existence and incorporating it in his rules so that all concerned can know what the system is and make arrangements to comply with it. What he has done is to leave it to the District Magistrate to see that persons desiring to hold a fair are in a position "to establish a proper system of conservancy, etc." But who, according to this, is to determine what a proper system is:	Precedent

The only law relevant here is sections 40 and 41 of Regulation III of 1877. Under section 40, the Chief Commissioner is empowered, among other things, to make rules about-
Section 41 provides for penalties in the following terms:
The first three sub-rules of Rule I deal with permits. They prohibit the holding of a fair except under a permit issued by the District Magistrate, and the District Magistrate is enjoined to-
The fourth sub-rule empowers the District Magistrate to "revoke any such permit without assigning any reasons or giving any previous notice".	Section
These sections were not impugned in the argument before us nor were they attacked in the petition made to the Judicial Commissioner, so we will pass on to the rules made by the Chief Commissioner.
In our opinion, the rules travel beyond the Regu-
ment of the section which authorises the making of the rules. A system of ad hoc control of responsible officers may, possibly be one method of regulating the sanitary and other arrangements at such large gatherings. But if it is intended to constitute a system of ad hoc control with reasonable safeguards, the power to make rules in that behalf must be granted to the rule-making authority by the legislative organ in appropriate language. The impugned order of the District Magistrate being bad on both the above grounds, this is enough to dispose of the appeal and it is not necessary to express any opinion as to whether the impugned order infringes also the appellant's fundamental rights under article 19. The appeal must accordingly be allowed.
Appeal allowed.	Conclusion
