The Central India Spinning Andweaving ... vs The Municipal Committee, Wardha on 18 December, 1957	Case Title
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 119 of 1953.
Appeal by special leave from the order dated September 11, 1950, of the Nagpur High Court in Miscellaneous Civil Case No. 77 of 1946.
A.V. Vishwanatha Sastri, G. J. Ghate and Naunit Lal, for the respondent.
1957. December 18. The following Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR J.-This is an appeal by Special Leave against a Judgment and order of the High Court of Judicature at Nagpur dated February 14, 1950 and the question for decision turns upon the construction of s. 66(1)(0) of the C. P. & Berar Municipalities Act (Act II of 1922) which in this judgment will be termed the Act.
Then follows the schedule.	Issue
A short recital of the facts of the case will suffice for its decision. The appellant is a company which has its spinning and weaving mills at Yeotmal. The appellant's bales of cotton are transported from Yeotmal to Nagpur by road and vehicles carrying them pass through the limits of Wardha Municipality. The goods being in transit, the vehicles carrying them do no more than use the road which traverses the municipal limits of Wardha and is a P.W.D. road. The goods are neither unloaded nor reloaded at Wardha but are merely carried across through the municipal area. The Municipal Committee purporting to act under s. 66(1)(0) of the Act and r. I of the rules made thereunder collected Rs. 240 as terminal tax on these goods on the ground that they were ex ported by the appellant from the limits of the Municipality of Wardha. The appellant thereupon claimed a refund of this sum. On refusal by the Municipality the appellant took an appeal to the Deputy Commissioner, Wardha which was sent for disposal to the Sub- Divisional Officer, who, on March 11, 1946, referred the following two questions under s. 83(2) of the Act to the High Court for its opinion:
The reference in the first instance came up for hearing before Sheode, J., who referred the matter to a Division Bench and the Division Bench in turn referred it to a Full Bench. The High Court after referring to a number of decided cases was of the opinion that the tax had been validly imposed and the appellant was therefore not entitled to a refund.	Facts
C.K. Daphtary, Solicitor-General of India and M.S. K. Sastri, for the appellants.	PetArg
The respondent's counsel sought to support his argument by referring to the following cases decided by various Indian High Courts where the words ,import' and 'export' were construed as meaning 'bring in' or 'take out of or away from' and it was also held that goods in transit are also covered by the words 'imported into'or 'exported from'. In Re Rahimu Bhanji (1) which was a case of a criminal prosecution for refusal to pay octroi on the ground that octroi was not due on goods in transit, the court gave a literal meaning to the word "import" and held that as the goods had been brought within the limits of the Municipality they were liable to octroi under the Rules which provided for a refund, which could be applied for. The definition of octroi seems to have been ignored in that case. In Narottamdas Harjivandas & Co. v. Bulsar Town Municipality (2) the tax was imposed on goods in transit and the argument raised was that the municipality had no power to impose a terminal tax upon such goods as were not meant for consumption within the limits of the Municipality. The court held:
had no reference to and was not qualified by any consideration of the place of manufacture or place of consumption. Rajadhyaksha J., said at p. 137:
The two Nagpur cases relied upon were Bhagwandas Harikishandas v. Municipal Committee, Yeotmal (1) and Kashiram Jhabarmal Firm v. Municipal Committee, Nagpur (2). In the former case the decision was again based solely on the literal dictionary meaning of the words " imported into or exported from ", and a further argument relying on the existence of the word " or " between "imported and exported " instead of "and........ as an argument against the ,imposition of the tax on goods in transit was also repelled. In the latter case where the goods were brought into the municipal limits for being despatched by rail the court again relied on the " plain meaning of the words "imported into or exported from " and also on certain government instructions which were in favour of the imposition of tax on goods in transit. There are also some unreported judgments of the Nagpur High Court taking a different view of the words" imported into or exported from"

(3)A.I.R. (1936) All. 743.
(5) I. L. R. (1940) All. 4.
In none of these cases was the argument as to the qualification stemming from the use of the words "terminal tax" considered nor was the signification of the word "terminal " as a prefix to the word tax discussed. The respondent also relied on Muller v. Baldwin (1) where it was held that " coals exported from the Port" must be taken to have been used in its ordinary meaning of " carried out of the Port " and therefore included coals taken out of the port in a steamer as " bunker coals " that is, coals taken on board for the purpose of consumption on the voyage. The argument that the term " exported " must receive a qualified interpretation and that it means taken for the. purpose of trade only was rejected. Lush J. said at p. 461 :-
Now three things clearly emerge from that (Muller's) case; (1) that the word "export " was not applied to coals in transit because the coals were taken from the port and started journey from there and would be included in the phrase "taken out" of the port and (2) that temporary taking out was not " export " as was held in Maganlal Bhagwandas v. Ahmedabad Municipality (2); (3) that the test is the intention with which the goods were brought in or taken out. It was urged that in accordance with the current authority of the different courts of India, a different interpretation should not be placed on the words of the section but this argument is of little avail in a case (1) (1874) 9 Q B- 457.
where the decision has not been acquiesced in for long or the authorities are not absolutely unanimous. Moreover it is not a case of disturbing the course of construction which has continued unchallenged for such a length of time as to acquire the sanction of continued decisions over a very long period and there is therefore no principle which will preclude this court from correcting the error. See William Hamilton and John Hamilton v. William Baker (1). The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company v. The Mayor, Alderman, and Burgesses of the Borough of Bury (2). Pate v. Pate (3).
In another case Wilson v. Robertson (4) under the statute the duty was imposed on all goods "imported into or exported from Berwick harbour" which extended down the Tweed to the sea but no part of it extended above the bridge. Goods were brought up the river in a sea-going vessel which having first used rings and posts put up by the Harbour Commissioners in order to moor while lowering the masts, passed through Berwick Bridge, and unloaded her cargo about two hundred yards above the bridge and beyond the limits of the harbour. It was held that goods were not " imported into " the harbour so as to make any dues payable in respect of them. The argument raised there was that as there was no harbour down the Tweed except Berwick and though the goods were actually unloaded above the Berwick bridge and out of the limits of the harbour it was substantially imported into the harbour. The vessel in that case was obliged to stop before passing the bridge and avail herself of the benefits of the machinery and works provided by the Commissioners and that was part of the means used towards the unloading of the vessel and it was argued that this would amount to import. Lord Cambell C. J. said:
Chief Justice Marshall dealing with the word " im- portation " said in Brown v. State of Maryland (1):
used adjectively with the word " tax", which makes it necessary to determine the meaning of the term terminal tax ". And the question then arises does it have reference to the jurisdictional limits of the Municipality or to the ultimate termination or the commencement of the journey of the goods as the case may be. In dealing with this the High Court said:
terminal ". It is obvious that it could refer either to the termini of the goods or the termini of the Municipality. It is clear to me that the word " terminal " refers not to the destination or origin of the goods but to the termini of the Municipal limits. Digby, J., pointed out that it refers to the traffic rather than the origin of the goods ". According to the Oxford Dictionary " terminal means end, boundary ; situated at or forming the end or extremity of something; situated at the end of a line of railway; forming or belonging to, a railway terminus.
In that case the court refused to regard automobile parking lots as falling within the scope of a statute which imposed a tax on general warehouse storage establishments. On this principle the word " terminal " must in the context be construed as having reference to terminus and has to be read to connote the idea of the end of something connected with motion and not that of an intermediate stage of a journey.
of India Act, 1915 as amended in 1919.Item 8 was as follows:
In the State List the item No. 52 which is as follows :
The legislative history of this tax thus shows that octroi was leviable on the entry of goods in a local area when the goods were for consumption, use or sale therein. The substituted tax was terminal tax on goods imported into or exported from a local area and by rules this tax in the case of Wardha Municipal Committee was imposed on certain class of goods imported and on others exported by railway or road. In 1935 the terminal tax was made leviable on goods carried by railway or air but the tax on entry of goods was imposable on goods for consumption, use or sale in a local area. Both these taxes have been continued by the Constitution. If the pre 1920 octroi and the post 1935 cess or tax on entry of goods is payable on -goods for consumption, use or sale, can it be said that the Constitution Act of 1915 as amended in 1919 or the Rules made thereunder intended to vary the nature of the tax by the introduction of item 8 in Sch. II ,under the Scheduled Tax Rules i.e. the tax became leviable on entry of goods or on their being taken out without their acquiring the qualification of incorporation with the mass of property of the local area. The presumption is against the imposition of new burdens. In the absence of clear intention to the contrary the incidence of the tax leviable under item 8 of Sch. II of the Schedule Tax Rules is incapable of having a different complexion from that which it had before 1920 or that which was clearly given after 1935. It was said in U. S. v. Fisher (1):
The Federal Court in Punjab Flour and General Mills Co. Ltd. v. Chief Officer, Corporation of City of Lahore (1) considered the meaning of the word (1) [1947] F.C.R. 17.
In our judgment there is no limitation to be implied in Entry No. 49, List II, in regard to the manner in which goods may be transported into a local area. It follows that so far as rail-borne goods are concerned the same goods may well be subjected to taxation under Entry No. 58 of List I as well to local taxation under Entry No. 49 of List II. The grounds of taxation under the two entries are, as indicated above, radically different, and there is no case for suggesting that taxation under the one entry limits or interferes in any way with taxation under the other." Therefore according to the Federal Court " terminal" has reference to the terminus of the railway or air i.e., the end of journey. The tax imposed in that case was held not to be a terminal tax but merely a cess on entry of goods into the local area within Entry No. 49 of List II even though it was imposed on railborne goods entering the municipal area.	Precedent
The powers of the Municipality to impose, assess and collect taxes are set out in chapter 9 of the Act and s. 66(1) enumerates the taxes which may be imposed. Clause (d) of sub-section (1) deals, with tolls; cl. (e) with octroi and cl. (o) with terminal tax. The sub-section provides:
The High Court was of the opinion that "The words ' export ' and I import ' have no special meaning. They bear the ordinary dictionary meaning, which has been the foundation for the decisions to which I have referred in the opening portion of my opinion. These words mean only 'taking out of and bringing into '. "
being liable to be refunded.' 'Import' is defined in the Rules as meaning 'conveying goods by Railway or by Ship or otherwise into Municipal limits'. It is clear therefore that the tax is leviable on all goods entering Municipal limits whether they are intended for consumption within the city or whether they are', merely in transit through the city to some other place ".
This decision rested on the definition of the words "
(1) I.L.R. (1945) Bom. 132.
import " was there given the meaning " carried into ". But the decision was based on the definitions given in the Statutory Rules to the word " import " which was " bringing into the terminal tax limits from outside those limits ". (1) A.I.R (1945) Nag. 197. (2) I.L.R. (1946) Nag.
(2) I.L.R. (1945) Bom. 132.
apply to goods in transit i.e. brought into the area for the purpose of being transported out of it. If the intention was to tax such goods then the word used should have been "
It would be quite legitimate to examine the legislative history of these " terminal taxes " which would be a useful aid to construction of clause (o) of s. 66(1). In the last century a tax known as Octroi payable on the entry of goods in a local area for consumption, use or sale therein was introduced. In 1920 an optional substitute called "terminal tax " came into existence by virtue of item 8 of Schedule 11 of the Scheduled Tax Rules framed under s. 80 A (3)(a) of the Government (1) I02 COIO 203, 78 Pac (2) 373.
The vires of the tax has not been assailed but the difference in the language of the two items in List I and II has been pressed before us for the purpose of showing that the word " terminal " implies the terminus of a journey and not the end of the jurisdictional limits of a Municipality. Terminal in item No. 58 of List I of the 1935 Constitution Act has reference to the terminus of carriage of goods. There is no reason to give to this word a different meaning in item No. 8 of Scheduled Tax Rules under the Government of India Act of 1915 or in clause (o) of s. 66(1) of the Act. The two sets of taxes in Lists I and 11 have different qualities. The "terminal tax" under item No. 58 of List I arises at the end of journey by railway wherever the end may be in relation to particular goods' and under item No. 49 of List 11 the tax or cess on entry of goods whatever the nomenclature is imposable when the goods enter a local area for consumption, use or sale therein. The two sets of taxes are so distinct that they may be imposed simultaneously, one when they reach their destination at the end of a railway journey and the other when they enter the limits of a local area for the object above mentioned. But in both cases the activity in regard to the motion of the goods ends, in the one case as the goods are carried no further by railway and in the other as their entry is for consumption, use or sale. Keeping in view the terms and language and the legislative history of the section 66(1) we are unable to enlarge the terms of the section by mere construction so as to include within its operation goods which are in transit and are being transported across the jurisdictional limits of the Municipality.	Section
The Constitution of India maintains this distinction in the Seventh Schedule and item No. 89 in List I corresponding to the above mentioned item No. 58 is "terminal taxes on goods or passengers, carried by railway, sea or air; taxes on railway fares and freights."
this judgment. Therefore terminal tax on goods imported or exported is similar in its incidence and is payable on goods on their journey ending within the municipal limits or commencing therefrom and not where the goods were merely in transit through the municipal limits and had their terminus elswhere.
We are, therefore, of the opinion that the terminal tax under s. 66(1)(o) is not leviable on goods which are in transit and are only carried across the limits of the Municipality, and would therefore allow this appeal, reverse the decision of the Nagpur High Court. The appellant will have its costs in this court and in the High Court.
Appeal allowed.	Conclusion
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 119 of 1953.
Appeal by special leave from the order dated September 11, 1950, of the Nagpur High Court in Miscellaneous Civil Case No. 77 of 1946.
C.K. Daphtary, Solicitor-General of India and M.S. K. Sastri, for the appellants.
A.V. Vishwanatha Sastri, G. J. Ghate and Naunit Lal, for the respondent.
1957. December 18. The following Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR J.-This is an appeal by Special Leave against a Judgment and order of the High Court of Judicature at Nagpur dated February 14, 1950 and the question for decision turns upon the construction of s. 66(1)(0) of the C. P. & Berar Municipalities Act (Act II of 1922) which in this judgment will be termed the Act.
A short recital of the facts of the case will suffice for its decision. The appellant is a company which has its spinning and weaving mills at Yeotmal. The appellant's bales of cotton are transported from Yeotmal to Nagpur by road and vehicles carrying them pass through the limits of Wardha Municipality. The goods being in transit, the vehicles carrying them do no more than use the road which traverses the municipal limits of Wardha and is a P.W.D. road. The goods are neither unloaded nor reloaded at Wardha but are merely carried across through the municipal area. The Municipal Committee purporting to act under s. 66(1)(0) of the Act and r. I of the rules made thereunder collected Rs. 240 as terminal tax on these goods on the ground that they were ex ported by the appellant from the limits of the Municipality of Wardha. The appellant thereupon claimed a refund of this sum. On refusal by the Municipality the appellant took an appeal to the Deputy Commissioner, Wardha which was sent for disposal to the Sub- Divisional Officer, who, on March 11, 1946, referred the following two questions under s. 83(2) of the Act to the High Court for its opinion:
The reference in the first instance came up for hearing before Sheode, J., who referred the matter to a Division Bench and the Division Bench in turn referred it to a Full Bench. The High Court after referring to a number of decided cases was of the opinion that the tax had been validly imposed and the appellant was therefore not entitled to a refund.
The powers of the Municipality to impose, assess and collect taxes are set out in chapter 9 of the Act and s. 66(1) enumerates the taxes which may be imposed. Clause (d) of sub-section (1) deals, with tolls; cl. (e) with octroi and cl. (o) with terminal tax. The sub-section provides:
Then follows the schedule.
The High Court was of the opinion that "The words ' export ' and I import ' have no special meaning. They bear the ordinary dictionary meaning, which has been the foundation for the decisions to which I have referred in the opening portion of my opinion. These words mean only 'taking out of and bringing into '. "
is indicative of the terminus ad quem or terminus a quo of the journey of the goods and excludes the goods in transit. The respondent on the other hand submits that the tax is leviable merely on the entry of the goods into the municipal limits or on their exit there. from and the word "terminal" has reference to the termini of the jurisdictional limits of the municipality and not to the journey of the goods. The efficacy of the relative contentions of the parties therefore requires the determination of the construction to be placed on the really important words of which are "terminal tax", "imported into or exported from" and " the limits of the Municipality". In construing these words of the statute if there are two possible interpretations then effect is to be given to the one that favours the citizen and not the one that imposes a burden on him. 'Import' is derived from the Latin word importare which means'to bring in' and 'export' from the Latin word exportare which means to carry out but these words are not to be interpreted only according to their literal derivations. Lexico-logically they do not have any reference to goods in'transit'a word derived from transire bearing a meaning similar to transport, i.e., to go across. The dictionary meaning of the words 'import' and 'export' is not restricted to their derivative meaning but bear other connotations also. According to Webster's International Dictionary the word "import" means to bring in from a foreign or external source; to introduce from without; especially to bring (wares or merchandise) into a place or country from a foreign country in the transactions of commerce; opposed to export. Similarly "export" according to Webster's International Dictionary means "to carry away; to remove; to carry or send abroad especially to foreign countries as merchandise or commodities in the way of commerce; the opposite of import ". The Oxford Dictionary gives a similar meaning to both these words. The word "transit" in the Oxford Dictionary means the action or fact of passing across or through; passage or journey from one place or point to another; the passage or carriage of persons or goods from one place to another ; it also means to pass across or through (something) to traverse, to cross. Even according to the ordinary meaning of the words which is relied upon by the respondent, goods which are in transit or are being transported can hardly be called goods 'imported into or exported from' because they are neither being exported nor imported but are merely goods carried across a particular stretch of territory or across a particular area with the object of being transported to their ultimate destination which in the instant case was Nagpur.
The respondent's counsel sought to support his argument by referring to the following cases decided by various Indian High Courts where the words ,import' and 'export' were construed as meaning 'bring in' or 'take out of or away from' and it was also held that goods in transit are also covered by the words 'imported into'or 'exported from'. In Re Rahimu Bhanji (1) which was a case of a criminal prosecution for refusal to pay octroi on the ground that octroi was not due on goods in transit, the court gave a literal meaning to the word "import" and held that as the goods had been brought within the limits of the Municipality they were liable to octroi under the Rules which provided for a refund, which could be applied for. The definition of octroi seems to have been ignored in that case. In Narottamdas Harjivandas & Co. v. Bulsar Town Municipality (2) the tax was imposed on goods in transit and the argument raised was that the municipality had no power to impose a terminal tax upon such goods as were not meant for consumption within the limits of the Municipality. The court held:
being liable to be refunded.' 'Import' is defined in the Rules as meaning 'conveying goods by Railway or by Ship or otherwise into Municipal limits'. It is clear therefore that the tax is leviable on all goods entering Municipal limits whether they are intended for consumption within the city or whether they are', merely in transit through the city to some other place ".
This decision rested on the definition of the words "
had no reference to and was not qualified by any consideration of the place of manufacture or place of consumption. Rajadhyaksha J., said at p. 137:
(1) I.L.R. (1945) Bom. 132.
The two Nagpur cases relied upon were Bhagwandas Harikishandas v. Municipal Committee, Yeotmal (1) and Kashiram Jhabarmal Firm v. Municipal Committee, Nagpur (2). In the former case the decision was again based solely on the literal dictionary meaning of the words " imported into or exported from ", and a further argument relying on the existence of the word " or " between "imported and exported " instead of "and........ as an argument against the ,imposition of the tax on goods in transit was also repelled. In the latter case where the goods were brought into the municipal limits for being despatched by rail the court again relied on the " plain meaning of the words "imported into or exported from " and also on certain government instructions which were in favour of the imposition of tax on goods in transit. There are also some unreported judgments of the Nagpur High Court taking a different view of the words" imported into or exported from"
import " was there given the meaning " carried into ". But the decision was based on the definitions given in the Statutory Rules to the word " import " which was " bringing into the terminal tax limits from outside those limits ". (1) A.I.R (1945) Nag. 197. (2) I.L.R. (1946) Nag.

(3)A.I.R. (1936) All. 743.
(5) I. L. R. (1940) All. 4.
In none of these cases was the argument as to the qualification stemming from the use of the words "terminal tax" considered nor was the signification of the word "terminal " as a prefix to the word tax discussed. The respondent also relied on Muller v. Baldwin (1) where it was held that " coals exported from the Port" must be taken to have been used in its ordinary meaning of " carried out of the Port " and therefore included coals taken out of the port in a steamer as " bunker coals " that is, coals taken on board for the purpose of consumption on the voyage. The argument that the term " exported " must receive a qualified interpretation and that it means taken for the. purpose of trade only was rejected. Lush J. said at p. 461 :-
Now three things clearly emerge from that (Muller's) case; (1) that the word "export " was not applied to coals in transit because the coals were taken from the port and started journey from there and would be included in the phrase "taken out" of the port and (2) that temporary taking out was not " export " as was held in Maganlal Bhagwandas v. Ahmedabad Municipality (2); (3) that the test is the intention with which the goods were brought in or taken out. It was urged that in accordance with the current authority of the different courts of India, a different interpretation should not be placed on the words of the section but this argument is of little avail in a case (1) (1874) 9 Q B- 457.
(2) I.L.R. (1945) Bom. 132.
where the decision has not been acquiesced in for long or the authorities are not absolutely unanimous. Moreover it is not a case of disturbing the course of construction which has continued unchallenged for such a length of time as to acquire the sanction of continued decisions over a very long period and there is therefore no principle which will preclude this court from correcting the error. See William Hamilton and John Hamilton v. William Baker (1). The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company v. The Mayor, Alderman, and Burgesses of the Borough of Bury (2). Pate v. Pate (3).
In another case Wilson v. Robertson (4) under the statute the duty was imposed on all goods "imported into or exported from Berwick harbour" which extended down the Tweed to the sea but no part of it extended above the bridge. Goods were brought up the river in a sea-going vessel which having first used rings and posts put up by the Harbour Commissioners in order to moor while lowering the masts, passed through Berwick Bridge, and unloaded her cargo about two hundred yards above the bridge and beyond the limits of the harbour. It was held that goods were not " imported into " the harbour so as to make any dues payable in respect of them. The argument raised there was that as there was no harbour down the Tweed except Berwick and though the goods were actually unloaded above the Berwick bridge and out of the limits of the harbour it was substantially imported into the harbour. The vessel in that case was obliged to stop before passing the bridge and avail herself of the benefits of the machinery and works provided by the Commissioners and that was part of the means used towards the unloading of the vessel and it was argued that this would amount to import. Lord Cambell C. J. said:
however, look only to what the legislature has enacted, in order to see whether this burthen is cast upon the defendants. The dues are only to be paid upon goods imported into the harbour of Berwick, the limits of which are defined by the Act, and which does not extend above the bridge. Now, has this iron been so imported ? It is admitted that, if it had been carried through the bridge to a port higher up the river, no dues would have been payable; and the plaintiff's counsel by that admits himself out of court.............. These observations support the submissions against the meaning of " export " or " import "
their derivative meaning without any reference to the ordinary connotation of these words as used in the commercial sense, the decided cases in India have ascribed too general a meaning to these words which it appears from the setting, context and history of the clause was not intended. The effect of the construction of " import " or "
Chief Justice Marshall dealing with the word " im- portation " said in Brown v. State of Maryland (1):
Similarly the word " export " has reference to taking out of goods which had become part and parcel of the mass of the property of the local area and will not (1) (1827) 12 Wheat 419, 442; 6 L. Ed 678, 686. (2) (1869) 4 EX. 260, 262.
apply to goods in transit i.e. brought into the area for the purpose of being transported out of it. If the intention was to tax such goods then the word used should have been "
used adjectively with the word " tax", which makes it necessary to determine the meaning of the term terminal tax ". And the question then arises does it have reference to the jurisdictional limits of the Municipality or to the ultimate termination or the commencement of the journey of the goods as the case may be. In dealing with this the High Court said:
terminal ". It is obvious that it could refer either to the termini of the goods or the termini of the Municipality. It is clear to me that the word " terminal " refers not to the destination or origin of the goods but to the termini of the Municipal limits. Digby, J., pointed out that it refers to the traffic rather than the origin of the goods ". According to the Oxford Dictionary " terminal means end, boundary ; situated at or forming the end or extremity of something; situated at the end of a line of railway; forming or belonging to, a railway terminus.
In that case the court refused to regard automobile parking lots as falling within the scope of a statute which imposed a tax on general warehouse storage establishments. On this principle the word " terminal " must in the context be construed as having reference to terminus and has to be read to connote the idea of the end of something connected with motion and not that of an intermediate stage of a journey.
It would be quite legitimate to examine the legislative history of these " terminal taxes " which would be a useful aid to construction of clause (o) of s. 66(1). In the last century a tax known as Octroi payable on the entry of goods in a local area for consumption, use or sale therein was introduced. In 1920 an optional substitute called "terminal tax " came into existence by virtue of item 8 of Schedule 11 of the Scheduled Tax Rules framed under s. 80 A (3)(a) of the Government (1) I02 COIO 203, 78 Pac (2) 373.
of India Act, 1915 as amended in 1919.Item 8 was as follows:
The Constitution of India maintains this distinction in the Seventh Schedule and item No. 89 in List I corresponding to the above mentioned item No. 58 is "terminal taxes on goods or passengers, carried by railway, sea or air; taxes on railway fares and freights."
In the State List the item No. 52 which is as follows :
The legislative history of this tax thus shows that octroi was leviable on the entry of goods in a local area when the goods were for consumption, use or sale therein. The substituted tax was terminal tax on goods imported into or exported from a local area and by rules this tax in the case of Wardha Municipal Committee was imposed on certain class of goods imported and on others exported by railway or road. In 1935 the terminal tax was made leviable on goods carried by railway or air but the tax on entry of goods was imposable on goods for consumption, use or sale in a local area. Both these taxes have been continued by the Constitution. If the pre 1920 octroi and the post 1935 cess or tax on entry of goods is payable on -goods for consumption, use or sale, can it be said that the Constitution Act of 1915 as amended in 1919 or the Rules made thereunder intended to vary the nature of the tax by the introduction of item 8 in Sch. II ,under the Scheduled Tax Rules i.e. the tax became leviable on entry of goods or on their being taken out without their acquiring the qualification of incorporation with the mass of property of the local area. The presumption is against the imposition of new burdens. In the absence of clear intention to the contrary the incidence of the tax leviable under item 8 of Sch. II of the Schedule Tax Rules is incapable of having a different complexion from that which it had before 1920 or that which was clearly given after 1935. It was said in U. S. v. Fisher (1):
this judgment. Therefore terminal tax on goods imported or exported is similar in its incidence and is payable on goods on their journey ending within the municipal limits or commencing therefrom and not where the goods were merely in transit through the municipal limits and had their terminus elswhere.
The vires of the tax has not been assailed but the difference in the language of the two items in List I and II has been pressed before us for the purpose of showing that the word " terminal " implies the terminus of a journey and not the end of the jurisdictional limits of a Municipality. Terminal in item No. 58 of List I of the 1935 Constitution Act has reference to the terminus of carriage of goods. There is no reason to give to this word a different meaning in item No. 8 of Scheduled Tax Rules under the Government of India Act of 1915 or in clause (o) of s. 66(1) of the Act. The two sets of taxes in Lists I and 11 have different qualities. The "terminal tax" under item No. 58 of List I arises at the end of journey by railway wherever the end may be in relation to particular goods' and under item No. 49 of List 11 the tax or cess on entry of goods whatever the nomenclature is imposable when the goods enter a local area for consumption, use or sale therein. The two sets of taxes are so distinct that they may be imposed simultaneously, one when they reach their destination at the end of a railway journey and the other when they enter the limits of a local area for the object above mentioned. But in both cases the activity in regard to the motion of the goods ends, in the one case as the goods are carried no further by railway and in the other as their entry is for consumption, use or sale. Keeping in view the terms and language and the legislative history of the section 66(1) we are unable to enlarge the terms of the section by mere construction so as to include within its operation goods which are in transit and are being transported across the jurisdictional limits of the Municipality.
The Federal Court in Punjab Flour and General Mills Co. Ltd. v. Chief Officer, Corporation of City of Lahore (1) considered the meaning of the word (1) [1947] F.C.R. 17.
In our judgment there is no limitation to be implied in Entry No. 49, List II, in regard to the manner in which goods may be transported into a local area. It follows that so far as rail-borne goods are concerned the same goods may well be subjected to taxation under Entry No. 58 of List I as well to local taxation under Entry No. 49 of List II. The grounds of taxation under the two entries are, as indicated above, radically different, and there is no case for suggesting that taxation under the one entry limits or interferes in any way with taxation under the other." Therefore according to the Federal Court " terminal" has reference to the terminus of the railway or air i.e., the end of journey. The tax imposed in that case was held not to be a terminal tax but merely a cess on entry of goods into the local area within Entry No. 49 of List II even though it was imposed on railborne goods entering the municipal area.
It is a noticeable feature of s. 66(1) that apart from the terminal tax there are 14 other heads of taxation imposable by the Municipality and in the case of each one of these 14 heads the tax is on some activity which takes place within the jurisdictional limits of the Municipality. This supports the contention of the appellant that the terminal tax leviable under cl. (o) properly construed must have reference to some activity within the municipal area i.e., the entry for the purpose of remaining within that area or commencement of journey from that area.
We are, therefore, of the opinion that the terminal tax under s. 66(1)(o) is not leviable on goods which are in transit and are only carried across the limits of the Municipality, and would therefore allow this appeal, reverse the decision of the Nagpur High Court. The appellant will have its costs in this court and in the High Court.
Appeal allowed.	Total Judgement
