Rai Bahadur Seth Teomal vs The Commissioner Of Income Tax Andthe ... on 2 March, 1959	Case Title
CIVIl APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeals Nos. 384 and 385 of 1957.
Appeal by special leave from the Order dated November 28, 1952, of the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal (Calcutta Bench) in I.T.A. No. 4067 and E.P.T. Appeal No. 391 of 1951-52.
N. C. Chatterjee, B. Sen Gupta and B. P. Maheshwari, for the appellant.
K. N. Rajagopala Sastri, R. H. Dhebar and D. Gupta, for the respondents.
Against these orders two appeals were taken to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner on April 30, 1948. In the appeal against income-tax assessment the appellant inter alia raised the following two grounds in regard to the jurisdiction of the Income-tax Officer, Calcutta:
The Tribunal thus held that as the objection related to the place of assessment the Tribunal was not competent to go into that question. Upon this the appellant applied for a reference to be made under s. 66(1) of the Act and prayed for five questions to be referred. The two questions relating to jurisdiction were:-	Issue
1959. March 2. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR, J.-These two appeals pursuant to special leave are brought against two orders of the Incometax Appellate Tribunal (Calcutta Bench) dated November 28, 1952, passed in appeal No. 1. T. A. 4067 of 1951-52 in respect of income-tax assessment for the assessment year ending 31st March, 1944, and in appeal No. E. P. T. A. 391 of 1951-52 in respect of Excess Profits tax assessment of the appellant for the chargeable accounting period ending March 31, 1943. The original assessee was R. B. Seth Teomal who was the manager of a Hindu undivided family. On Seth Teomal's death on May 30, 1944, Seth Ottanmal became the manager. He is now the appellant representing the Hindu undivided family. He will be termed as the appellant in these appeals. Seth Teomal was carrying on the businesss of a railway contractor at Lalmonirhat in the district of Rangpur which is now in Pakistan. In April 1943 a notice was served on him under s. 22(2) of the Income-tax Act (hereinafter called the Act). He filed the return on February 28, 1944. The Income-tax Officer,Rangpur, served notices on him under ss. 22(4) and 23(2) for production of books, etc. It appears that assessment proceedings continued before the Income-tax Officer Rangpur, but no final assessment was made. According to an affidavit which has now been filed in this Court the Central Board of Revenue by an order passed under sub-s. (2) of s. 5 of the Act assigned the appellant's case along with some other assessment cases to the Commissioner of Income-tax (Central), Calcutta. The order contains the following endorsements which give an indication of the reason for the case being assigned to the Commissioner of Income. tax (Central):
Thus the appellant's case which was before an incometax Officer within the area in charge of the Commissioner of Income-tax, Bengal (Mofissil) was withdrawn from him and was assigned to the Commissioner of Income-tax (Central), Calcutta. On February 11, 1948, the Income-tax Officer District N-C (I. T. cum E.P.T.) to whom it appears the appellant's assessment case was assigned issued notice again under ss. 22(4) and 23(2) of the Act. That officer after making the usual enquiries made the assessment order on March 15, 1948. The order for Excess Profits Tax assessment was made on March 30,1948.
The High Court dismissed this application on July 23, 1954. No appeal has been filed in this Court against the order of the High Court but an appeal has been filed against the order passed by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal. On behalf of the Revenue a preliminary objection was taken that as no appeal had been filed against the order of the High Court that order had become final and this Court, therefore, should not entertain the appeal against the order of the Tribunal and reliance was placed on the observations of Venkatarama (1) [1945] F.C.R. 65; 13 I.T.R. 39.	Facts
" 2. For that the appellant begs leave to repeat that transfer was not legal or proper and was not made by any proper authority to legalise such transfer ". In the Excess Profits Tax appeal also this time an objection was taken as to jurisdiction :
Counsel for the appellant has urged two grounds in support of his appeal: (1) that his place of business was Lalmonirhat and under s. 64 (1) and (2) of the Act he was entitled to be assessed by the Income-tax Officer of that area and (2) that assessment by the Income-tax Officer of Calcutta was an illegal assumption of jurisdiction and therefore he was entitled to have the order of assessment quashed. In order to decide these questions reference has to be made to the scheme. of the Act. The provisions relevant to the issue of jurisdiction are ss. 5 and 64. The former is headed " Income-tax authorities " and the latter "
It was contended on behalf of the assessee that he produced his accounts before the Income Tax Officer at Calcutta under protest. There is no mention of this protest in the assessment file and that is what was stated by the Commissioner of Income Tax in his reply which he gave on March 3, 1953, before the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal and which has been set out above. If such an objection had been raised the question would have been referred by the Income- tax Officer to the Commissioner as required under s. 64(3). That stage never arose because the objection does not seem to have been taken at the stage when it should have been taken, i.e., before the Income-tax Officer, Calcutta. But it is contended by counsel for the appellant that in the present case there is an illegal assumption of jurisdiction as the officer who made the assessment had no jurisdiction at all to make the assessment. It was also contended that if the Central Board of Revenue wanted to transfer the assessment proceedings from the Income-tax Officer, Rangpur, to the Income-tax Officer at Calcutta, it could only exercise that jurisdiction by making an order under s. 5(7A) and not under s. 5(2) of the Act. He relied on Taylor v. Taylor (1) where it was held that if a mode of exercise of power is laid down in the statute it has to be exercised in that way and no other. He also relied on Nazir Ahmad v. The King Emperor (2). He further contended that this was not a case which fell under s. 5(2) of the Act. Section 5(7A) gives to the Central Board of Revenue the power to transfer any case from one Income-tax Officer to another which can be mad6 at any stage of the proceedings and does not necessitate the reissuing of a notice under s. 22(2) if it had already been issued by the Income-tax Officer from whom the case is transferred and in the explanation- the word ' case' in relation to any person whose name is specified in the order of transfer means (1) (1875) 1 Ch. D. 426, 431 (2) (1936) L.R. 63 I.A. 372.	PetArg
Thus under s. 64(3) the question of determination as to the place of assessment only arises if an objection is taken by the assessee and the Income Tax Officer has any doubts as to the matter. But the determination is to be by the Commissioner of Income Tax or the Central Board of Revenue. The Act does not 'contemplate any other authority.	RespArg
The Appellate Tribunal held against the appellant in a short paragraph:
Aiyar, J., in Govinda Rajulu Mudaliar v. Commissioner of Income-tax (1). At p. 810 it was observed:
But counsel for the appellant relied on Dhakeswari Cotton Mills Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax (2) where the scope of appeals under Art. 136 were set out by the learned Chief Justice. In this case however it is not necessary to go into this question because in our opinion there is little substance in the appeal itself.
If the Central Board of Revenue had the power to direct the Commissioner of Incometax (Central), Calcutta, to exercise his functions in (1) [1957] S.C.R. 233, 266.
In view of this provision no objection can be taken on the ground of sub-sections (1) and (2) of s. 64. Counsel for the appellant relied on a judgment of the Bombay High Court in Dayaldas Kushiram v. Commissioner of Income- tax (Central) (1), where it was held that s. 64 was intended to ensure that as far as practicable the assessee should be assessed locally, i. e., by the Income-tax Officer of the area in which the assessee carries on business and there must, so far as the exigencies of the case allow, be some reasonable relation to the place where the assessee carries on business or resides. In that case the assessee was carrying on business in C Ward and the proper officer -under s. 64 to assess him was the Income-tax Officer of that Ward. As a result of the coming into force of s. 5(2) the Commissioner of Income-tax (Central) was created without reference to the area. The case of the assessee on whom the notice had been served but had not been assessed in due course assigned to the Commissioner of Income-tax (Central) who designated an Income-tax Officer for assessment of the assessee. The assessee thereupon made an application under s. 45 of (1)[1939] 8 I.T.R. 139.
Counsel for the appellant also relied 'on the judgment of the Allahabad High Court in Dina Nath Hem Raj v. Commissioner of Income-tax (1). In that case the assessee was carrying on business at Calcutta and he was sought to be assessed at Kanpur and an objection was taken to the Income- tax Officer, Kanpur, making the assessment. The Income-tax Officer did not proceed in accordance with s. 64(3) and therefore it was held that assessment made by him was without jurisdiction. In the present case no question has been raised as to the jurisdiction of the Income-tax Officer who made the assessment and apart from that the order was made by the Central Board of Revenue under s. 5(2) of the Act and s. 64(5) becomes operative and sub-ss. (1) and (2) of s. 64 are inoperative. See also Seth Kanhaiyalal v. Commissioner of Incometax (2).
jurisdiction and in any event it is not one for adjudication by the Court............... This confirms us in the view that the scheme of the Act does not contemplate an objection as to the place of assessment being raised on an appeal against the assessment after the assessment has been made. As we have already pointed out, the objection was not raised in the present case even before the Appellate Income-tax Officer but only before the Appellate Tribunal ". There is nothing in the Bidi Supply case (1) which in any way detracts from the efficacy of the decision of the Federal Court in Wallace Brothers' case (2). We have already said that Bidi Supply case (1) deals with the vires of s. 5(7A).	Precedent
(2) [1936] 5 I.T.R. 739.
lies under s. 30 to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and a further appeal to Income-tax Appellate Tribunal under s. 33 of the Act. And then a reference can be made by the Tribunal to the High Court under s. 66 (1) of the Act and if the Tribunal does not make such reference the High Court can under s. 66 (2) be moved and it can then direct that such reference be made.
The heading of s. 64 is " Place of assessment ". Sub-section (1) of s. 64 provides that the assessee shall be assessed by the Income-tax Officer of the area in which he carries on his business. Sub-section (2) lays down that in all other cases an assessee shall be assessed by the Income-tax Officer of the area in which he resides. Under these two sub-sections therefore the appellant, because he was carrying on business at Lalmonirhat, had to be assessed by the Income-tax Officer of that area, i.e., by the Income-tax Officer of Rangpur. Sub-section (3) of that section provides that if a question as to the place of assessment arises, it is to be determined by the Commissioner of Income-tax or by Central Board of Revenue according as the case may be. Under the first proviso to this sub-section before the question as to the place of assessment is determined the assessee has to have an opportunity of representing his views and under the second proviso the place of assessment cannot be called into question by the assessee if he has made a return in response to the notice under sub-s. (1) of s. 22 and has stated therein the principal place where he carries on his business or if he has not made such a return, the time specified in the notice has expired. The third proviso to this subsection is:
all proceedings under the Act which may be pending on the date of the transfer and includes all proceedings which may be commenced after the date of the transfer. Section 5 although headed I Income-tax authorities' also gives to the Central Board of Revenue and the Commissioners of Income-tax certain powers in regard to withdrawing of cases from one area into other and from one Income-tax Officer to another. Sub-section (2) of this section gives power to the Central Government to appoint as many Commis- sioner's of Income-tax as it thinks fit and they have to perform their functions in respect of different areas, persons and bases or classes thereof. The relevant portion of the sub-section is as follows:-
respect of several cases including the appellant's mentioned in the order dated November 29, 1946, as indeed it had under s. 5(2), then neither that order could be challenged nor the power of the Income-tax Officer, Calcutta, to make the assessment. After an order by the Central Board of Revenue under s. 5(2) of the Act the provisions of sub-ss. (1) and (2) of s. 64 have no application because of sub-s. (5a) of s. 64 which is as follows :
section (2) of section 5 is exercising the functions of a Commissioner of Income-tax".
The question then-arises whether the objection as to the place of assessment, i. e., by the Income-tax Officer of Calcutta could be challenged in appeal to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and then before the Appellate Tribunal. In our opinion it could not be. The scheme of the Act shows that no appeal in regard to the objection to the place of assessment is contemplated under the Act. Under s. 64(3) of the Act a question as to the place of assessment, when it arises, is determined by the Commissioner. Any such order cannot be made a ground of appeal to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner under s. 30 of the Act which provides for appeals against orders of assessment and other orders enumerated in s. 30 but no appeals is there provided against orders made under s. 64(3). Similarly appeals to the Appellate Tribunal which lie under s. 33 of the Act also do not provide for any appeal on the question of the place of assessment. In Wallace Brothers' case (3) at p. 79 Spens, C. J., after referring to s. 64(3) and the proviso thereto said:	Section
(2) [1956] S.C.R. 267.
(.3) [1945] F.C.R. 65: 13 I.T.R. 39.
In this view of the matter the question as to the place of assessment does not arise out of the order of the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal and therefore no question of law could be referred nor could the High Court make such order under s. 66(2). In our opinion, the High Court rightly dismissed the appellant's application for directing the case to be stated under s. 66(2) of the Act.
The appeals therefore fail and are dismissed with costs. In the circumstances of the case there will be only one set of costs.
Appeals dismissed.

CIVIl APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeals Nos. 384 and 385 of 1957.
Appeal by special leave from the Order dated November 28, 1952, of the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal (Calcutta Bench) in I.T.A. No. 4067 and E.P.T. Appeal No. 391 of 1951-52.

1959. March 2. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR, J.-These two appeals pursuant to special leave are brought against two orders of the Incometax Appellate Tribunal (Calcutta Bench) dated November 28, 1952, passed in appeal No. 1. T. A. 4067 of 1951-52 in respect of income-tax assessment for the assessment year ending 31st March, 1944, and in appeal No. E. P. T. A. 391 of 1951-52 in respect of Excess Profits tax assessment of the appellant for the chargeable accounting period ending March 31, 1943. The original assessee was R. B. Seth Teomal who was the manager of a Hindu undivided family. On Seth Teomal's death on May 30, 1944, Seth Ottanmal became the manager. He is now the appellant representing the Hindu undivided family. He will be termed as the appellant in these appeals. Seth Teomal was carrying on the businesss of a railway contractor at Lalmonirhat in the district of Rangpur which is now in Pakistan. In April 1943 a notice was served on him under s. 22(2) of the Income-tax Act (hereinafter called the Act). He filed the return on February 28, 1944. The Income-tax Officer,Rangpur, served notices on him under ss. 22(4) and 23(2) for production of books, etc. It appears that assessment proceedings continued before the Income-tax Officer Rangpur, but no final assessment was made. According to an affidavit which has now been filed in this Court the Central Board of Revenue by an order passed under sub-s. (2) of s. 5 of the Act assigned the appellant's case along with some other assessment cases to the Commissioner of Income-tax (Central), Calcutta. The order contains the following endorsements which give an indication of the reason for the case being assigned to the Commissioner of Income. tax (Central):
Thus the appellant's case which was before an incometax Officer within the area in charge of the Commissioner of Income-tax, Bengal (Mofissil) was withdrawn from him and was assigned to the Commissioner of Income-tax (Central), Calcutta. On February 11, 1948, the Income-tax Officer District N-C (I. T. cum E.P.T.) to whom it appears the appellant's assessment case was assigned issued notice again under ss. 22(4) and 23(2) of the Act. That officer after making the usual enquiries made the assessment order on March 15, 1948. The order for Excess Profits Tax assessment was made on March 30,1948.
Against these orders two appeals were taken to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner on April 30, 1948. In the appeal against income-tax assessment the appellant inter alia raised the following two grounds in regard to the jurisdiction of the Income-tax Officer, Calcutta:
" 2. For that the appellant begs leave to repeat that transfer was not legal or proper and was not made by any proper authority to legalise such transfer ". In the Excess Profits Tax appeal also this time an objection was taken as to jurisdiction :
The Appellate Tribunal held against the appellant in a short paragraph:
The Tribunal thus held that as the objection related to the place of assessment the Tribunal was not competent to go into that question. Upon this the appellant applied for a reference to be made under s. 66(1) of the Act and prayed for five questions to be referred. The two questions relating to jurisdiction were:-
The High Court dismissed this application on July 23, 1954. No appeal has been filed in this Court against the order of the High Court but an appeal has been filed against the order passed by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal. On behalf of the Revenue a preliminary objection was taken that as no appeal had been filed against the order of the High Court that order had become final and this Court, therefore, should not entertain the appeal against the order of the Tribunal and reliance was placed on the observations of Venkatarama (1) [1945] F.C.R. 65; 13 I.T.R. 39.
(2) [1936] 5 I.T.R. 739.
Aiyar, J., in Govinda Rajulu Mudaliar v. Commissioner of Income-tax (1). At p. 810 it was observed:
But counsel for the appellant relied on Dhakeswari Cotton Mills Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax (2) where the scope of appeals under Art. 136 were set out by the learned Chief Justice. In this case however it is not necessary to go into this question because in our opinion there is little substance in the appeal itself.
Counsel for the appellant has urged two grounds in support of his appeal: (1) that his place of business was Lalmonirhat and under s. 64 (1) and (2) of the Act he was entitled to be assessed by the Income-tax Officer of that area and (2) that assessment by the Income-tax Officer of Calcutta was an illegal assumption of jurisdiction and therefore he was entitled to have the order of assessment quashed. In order to decide these questions reference has to be made to the scheme. of the Act. The provisions relevant to the issue of jurisdiction are ss. 5 and 64. The former is headed " Income-tax authorities " and the latter "
lies under s. 30 to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and a further appeal to Income-tax Appellate Tribunal under s. 33 of the Act. And then a reference can be made by the Tribunal to the High Court under s. 66 (1) of the Act and if the Tribunal does not make such reference the High Court can under s. 66 (2) be moved and it can then direct that such reference be made.
The heading of s. 64 is " Place of assessment ". Sub-section (1) of s. 64 provides that the assessee shall be assessed by the Income-tax Officer of the area in which he carries on his business. Sub-section (2) lays down that in all other cases an assessee shall be assessed by the Income-tax Officer of the area in which he resides. Under these two sub-sections therefore the appellant, because he was carrying on business at Lalmonirhat, had to be assessed by the Income-tax Officer of that area, i.e., by the Income-tax Officer of Rangpur. Sub-section (3) of that section provides that if a question as to the place of assessment arises, it is to be determined by the Commissioner of Income-tax or by Central Board of Revenue according as the case may be. Under the first proviso to this sub-section before the question as to the place of assessment is determined the assessee has to have an opportunity of representing his views and under the second proviso the place of assessment cannot be called into question by the assessee if he has made a return in response to the notice under sub-s. (1) of s. 22 and has stated therein the principal place where he carries on his business or if he has not made such a return, the time specified in the notice has expired. The third proviso to this subsection is:
Thus under s. 64(3) the question of determination as to the place of assessment only arises if an objection is taken by the assessee and the Income Tax Officer has any doubts as to the matter. But the determination is to be by the Commissioner of Income Tax or the Central Board of Revenue. The Act does not 'contemplate any other authority.
It was contended on behalf of the assessee that he produced his accounts before the Income Tax Officer at Calcutta under protest. There is no mention of this protest in the assessment file and that is what was stated by the Commissioner of Income Tax in his reply which he gave on March 3, 1953, before the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal and which has been set out above. If such an objection had been raised the question would have been referred by the Income- tax Officer to the Commissioner as required under s. 64(3). That stage never arose because the objection does not seem to have been taken at the stage when it should have been taken, i.e., before the Income-tax Officer, Calcutta. But it is contended by counsel for the appellant that in the present case there is an illegal assumption of jurisdiction as the officer who made the assessment had no jurisdiction at all to make the assessment. It was also contended that if the Central Board of Revenue wanted to transfer the assessment proceedings from the Income-tax Officer, Rangpur, to the Income-tax Officer at Calcutta, it could only exercise that jurisdiction by making an order under s. 5(7A) and not under s. 5(2) of the Act. He relied on Taylor v. Taylor (1) where it was held that if a mode of exercise of power is laid down in the statute it has to be exercised in that way and no other. He also relied on Nazir Ahmad v. The King Emperor (2). He further contended that this was not a case which fell under s. 5(2) of the Act. Section 5(7A) gives to the Central Board of Revenue the power to transfer any case from one Income-tax Officer to another which can be mad6 at any stage of the proceedings and does not necessitate the reissuing of a notice under s. 22(2) if it had already been issued by the Income-tax Officer from whom the case is transferred and in the explanation- the word ' case' in relation to any person whose name is specified in the order of transfer means (1) (1875) 1 Ch. D. 426, 431 (2) (1936) L.R. 63 I.A. 372.
all proceedings under the Act which may be pending on the date of the transfer and includes all proceedings which may be commenced after the date of the transfer. Section 5 although headed I Income-tax authorities' also gives to the Central Board of Revenue and the Commissioners of Income-tax certain powers in regard to withdrawing of cases from one area into other and from one Income-tax Officer to another. Sub-section (2) of this section gives power to the Central Government to appoint as many Commis- sioner's of Income-tax as it thinks fit and they have to perform their functions in respect of different areas, persons and bases or classes thereof. The relevant portion of the sub-section is as follows:-
If the Central Board of Revenue had the power to direct the Commissioner of Incometax (Central), Calcutta, to exercise his functions in (1) [1957] S.C.R. 233, 266.
(2) [1956] S.C.R. 267.
respect of several cases including the appellant's mentioned in the order dated November 29, 1946, as indeed it had under s. 5(2), then neither that order could be challenged nor the power of the Income-tax Officer, Calcutta, to make the assessment. After an order by the Central Board of Revenue under s. 5(2) of the Act the provisions of sub-ss. (1) and (2) of s. 64 have no application because of sub-s. (5a) of s. 64 which is as follows :
section (2) of section 5 is exercising the functions of a Commissioner of Income-tax".
In view of this provision no objection can be taken on the ground of sub-sections (1) and (2) of s. 64. Counsel for the appellant relied on a judgment of the Bombay High Court in Dayaldas Kushiram v. Commissioner of Income- tax (Central) (1), where it was held that s. 64 was intended to ensure that as far as practicable the assessee should be assessed locally, i. e., by the Income-tax Officer of the area in which the assessee carries on business and there must, so far as the exigencies of the case allow, be some reasonable relation to the place where the assessee carries on business or resides. In that case the assessee was carrying on business in C Ward and the proper officer -under s. 64 to assess him was the Income-tax Officer of that Ward. As a result of the coming into force of s. 5(2) the Commissioner of Income-tax (Central) was created without reference to the area. The case of the assessee on whom the notice had been served but had not been assessed in due course assigned to the Commissioner of Income-tax (Central) who designated an Income-tax Officer for assessment of the assessee. The assessee thereupon made an application under s. 45 of (1)[1939] 8 I.T.R. 139.
the Specific Relief Act and prayed for direction to the Commissioner of Income-tax (Central) and the Incometax Officer to whom his case had been assigned to forbear from continuing the proceedings on the grounds that the Income- tax Officer had no jurisdiction having regard to s. 64 of the Act. It was held that the Income-tax Officer was not the Income-tax Officer of the area in which the assessee was carrying on business. It was also held that in spite of the insertion of s. 5(2) of the Act such assessment was without jurisdiction because there was no amendment of s. 64. As a result of this judgment Ordinance IX of 1939 was promulgated which subsequently was enacted as subs. 5 of s. 64. After the Ordinance the assessee Dayaldas Kushiram was assessed by the same Officer and after unsuccessful appeals to the Commissioner of Income-tax and the Appellate Tribunal he made an application under s. 66(1) on three questions: (1) Whether the order passed by the Commissioner of Incometax deciding the place of assessment of the assessee could be the subject matter of appeal to the Incometax Appellate Tribunal; (2) Whether the Tribunal had the power to entertain an appeal on the question as to the place of assessment of an assessee even in the absence of the order of Commissioner of Income-tax and (3) whether the question ,as to the place of assessment is a question of law arising out of the order of the Appellate Tribunal. It was held that the order of the Commissioner was made under s. 5(2) and not under s. 64(3) and as the Ordinance had retrospective effect these questions did not arise and that the assessment of the assessee was validly made by the Income-tax Officer and the Ordinance removed the invalidity of the orders made prior to the passing of the Ordinance so far as they related to the assessee. Beaumont, C. J., held that the Income-tax Act did not determine the place of assessment but the officer who had to assess and that there could be no appeal under the Act against the order of the Commissioner as to the place of assessment, but only against the order of assessment of the Income-tax Officer.
Counsel for the appellant also relied 'on the judgment of the Allahabad High Court in Dina Nath Hem Raj v. Commissioner of Income-tax (1). In that case the assessee was carrying on business at Calcutta and he was sought to be assessed at Kanpur and an objection was taken to the Income- tax Officer, Kanpur, making the assessment. The Income-tax Officer did not proceed in accordance with s. 64(3) and therefore it was held that assessment made by him was without jurisdiction. In the present case no question has been raised as to the jurisdiction of the Income-tax Officer who made the assessment and apart from that the order was made by the Central Board of Revenue under s. 5(2) of the Act and s. 64(5) becomes operative and sub-ss. (1) and (2) of s. 64 are inoperative. See also Seth Kanhaiyalal v. Commissioner of Incometax (2).
The question then-arises whether the objection as to the place of assessment, i. e., by the Income-tax Officer of Calcutta could be challenged in appeal to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and then before the Appellate Tribunal. In our opinion it could not be. The scheme of the Act shows that no appeal in regard to the objection to the place of assessment is contemplated under the Act. Under s. 64(3) of the Act a question as to the place of assessment, when it arises, is determined by the Commissioner. Any such order cannot be made a ground of appeal to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner under s. 30 of the Act which provides for appeals against orders of assessment and other orders enumerated in s. 30 but no appeals is there provided against orders made under s. 64(3). Similarly appeals to the Appellate Tribunal which lie under s. 33 of the Act also do not provide for any appeal on the question of the place of assessment. In Wallace Brothers' case (3) at p. 79 Spens, C. J., after referring to s. 64(3) and the proviso thereto said:
(.3) [1945] F.C.R. 65: 13 I.T.R. 39.
jurisdiction and in any event it is not one for adjudication by the Court............... This confirms us in the view that the scheme of the Act does not contemplate an objection as to the place of assessment being raised on an appeal against the assessment after the assessment has been made. As we have already pointed out, the objection was not raised in the present case even before the Appellate Income-tax Officer but only before the Appellate Tribunal ". There is nothing in the Bidi Supply case (1) which in any way detracts from the efficacy of the decision of the Federal Court in Wallace Brothers' case (2). We have already said that Bidi Supply case (1) deals with the vires of s. 5(7A).
In this view of the matter the question as to the place of assessment does not arise out of the order of the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal and therefore no question of law could be referred nor could the High Court make such order under s. 66(2). In our opinion, the High Court rightly dismissed the appellant's application for directing the case to be stated under s. 66(2) of the Act.
The appeals therefore fail and are dismissed with costs. In the circumstances of the case there will be only one set of costs.
Appeals dismissed.
