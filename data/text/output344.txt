Sadhu Singh Harnam Singh vs The State Of Pepsu on 8 October, 1953	Case Title
1. This appeal which comes by special leave obtained by the appellant Sadhu Singh, is from a decision of a Division Bench of the High Court of Patiala dated 2-6-1952 by which the sentence of transportation for life passed against him for the murder of one Harbachan Singh was affirmed.	Issue
2. The facts are, that on 29-10-1949 Harbachan Singh, deceased, went to village Bihla because he intended to borrow a camel from Nand Singh, P. W. 4. P. Ws. Chand Singh and Amar Singh accompanied him to Bihla and the party reached there between 7 and 8 P.M. On arrival at Nand Singh's house it was found that he had gone to the house of Sadhu Singh. Nand Singh's son was asked to go to Sadhu Singh's house and call Nand Singh from there. Nand Singh's son returned with a message from his father inviting the party to Sadhu Singh's house. Accordingly they all went there and found Nand Singh in the midst of a liquor party. The appellant's father Harnam Singh was also there. It is said that on the arrival of Harbachan Singh who was a Mahant, Sadhu Singh got up and received him respectfully and felt honoured by his visit to his house. The Mahant and his two companions, Chand Singh and Amar Singh were offered drinks. The deceased Mahant accepted the drink but the others did not.
Later on, the deceased Mahant who was addicted to taking opium gave one rupee to a young boy who was there and asked him to get him opium worth that amount. Sadhu Singh at this remarked, that it was not proper that the Mahant should send someone else to bring opium while he was a guest in his house. He therefore asked his father to give opium to the Mahant. This was done. When, however, the deceased took some opium from the small tin given to him by Harnam Singh and returned it to him, the latter thought that very little opium was left in the tin for his own use and this annoyed him and he made some remarks showing his resentment at this. The deceased Mahant did not like this and returned the opium that he had taken and got ready to leave the place along with his companions. As soon as he came out of the room he was hit by gunshot in the chest. He was mortally wounded and fell down.
Chand Singh and Amar Singh went to the police station and lodged the first information report at 12-30 A.M. on the 30th. On the basis of this report a case was registered against the accused under Section 338, I. P. C. It was then thought by the police that the accused was guilty of a rash and negligent act endangering human life and personal safety. During the pendency of this case, Harbachan Singh died as a result of the injuries caused by the accused and the charge against him was then changed into one under Section 304A, I. P. C. Later on, it appears that some further change was made in the chalan and the offence was changed into one under Section 302, I. P. C. The Additional District Magistrate who heard the case, reached the conclusion that there was a 'prima facie' case against the accused under Section 304A, I. P. C. He accordingly framed a charge against him under that section. He also held that there was no 'prima facie' case against the accused under Section 302 and in these circumstances there was no sufficient ground for committing him to the court of session. In the result, the accused was convicted under Section 304A, I. P. C. and as he had already suffered as an undertrial prisoner he was directed to be released on his executing a personal bond for the amount of Rs. 5,000 and on furnishing a surety for a like amount with the undertaking that he will keep the peace and be of good behavior for a period of one year from the date of order.
3. Against this order an application in revision was made to the Sessions Judge, Barnala, by the Public Prosecutor and another similar application was made by the heirs of Harbachan Singh. The learned Sessions Judge was not prepared to allow these applications and rejected them. Then two applications for revision were made to the High Court against both the orders of the Additional District Magistrate, viz., the order discharging Sadhu Singh of the offence of murder and also the order convicting him under Section 304A, I. P. C. The High Court in revision set aside both the orders of the Additional District Magistrate and remanded the case to him with a direction that he should frame a proper charge and commit the accused to the Sessions for trial. In accordance with this direction the Magistrate committed the accused to the Court of Session.
4. The learned Sessions Judge accepted the evidence of the three eye-witnesses, P. Ws. 3, 4 and 9, and held that Sadhu Singh, the accused, fired his gun at the deceased with the intention of causing death or such bodily injury as would suffice in the ordinary course of nature to cause death and that he was guilty of the offence under Section 302, I. P. C. He, however, held that the accused's mind was affected by drink and he more readily gave way to violent passion and that the ends of justice would be sufficiently met if he was given transportation for life. A recommendation was made to the local Government to commute the sentence into a shorter term of imprisonment. On appeal, the conviction of the appellant as well as the sentence were maintained.	Facts
9. The last witness on this point is Nand Singh, P. W. 4. On the point as to how the incident actually happened he stated as follows:	RespArg
In the first information report given by Amar Singh in the presence of Chand Singh the version as to how the deceased Mahant met his end is in these terms :
To further questions in cross-examination the witness stated as follows :
7. It is clear from this statement that as regards the nature and character of the act of Sadhu Singh there was a complete change from the version given by this witness immediately after the occurrence and the one given by him in the court of the committing magistrate and at the trial. This change in the chain of events as to how they happened goes to the root of the case. According to the earlier version, the death was accidental or in all likelihood, caused by a rash and negligent act on the part of the accused, while according to the later version, it was a clear case of intentional murder. Herein it was made out that after an altercation between Sadhu Singh and the Mahant, Sadhu Singh loaded the gun, aimed it at the Mahant and fired at him.
8. Chand Singh, P. W. 3, who accompanied Amar Singh, at the trial supported in the main the narrative of the incident given by Amar Singh. This is what he said about the actual act and conduct of the accused in firing with his gun :
This witness has not supported the version of Amar Singh that the gun was loaded at that very moment before it was fired and in the presence of the witnesses. In cross-examination this witness made the following significant statement :
He further said-
In the statement of the witness recorded under Section 164, Cr. P. C. on this important question, he said as follows :
In cross-examination the witness, however, said as follows:
In his statement before the police, Ex. D. A., the version given by this witness is as follows:
11. In --'Pritam Singh v. The State', , this Court held that it will not grant special leave to appeal under Article 136(1) of the Constitution unless it is shown that exceptional and special circumstances exist, that substantial and grave injustice has been done and the case in question presents features of sufficient gravity to warrant a review of the decision appealed against and that only those points can be urged at the final hearing of the appeal which are fit to be urged at the preliminary stage when leave is asked for. It is well established that this court does not by special leave convert itself into a court to review evidence for a third time. Where, however, the court below fails in apprehending the true effect of a material change in the versions given by the witnesses immediately after the occurrence and the narrative at the trial with respect to the nature and character of the offence, it seems to us that in such a situation it would not be right for this court to affirm such a decision when it occasions a failure of justice. While dealing with this question the High Court made the following significant observations:
12. It seems to us that the High Court was in error in thinking that there was not a single difference between the statements made by the witnesses in the first information report and the statements made at the trial, which went to the root of the case. As above pointed out, the whole version as to the nature and character of the act of the accused had been completely changed. An act which on the facts stated in the first information report and on the statements made to the police may well be regarded either accidental or rash and negligent, has been deliberately made to look like an act of deliberate murder. If such a difference does not go to the root of the case it is difficult to conceive what else can fall within that class of cases. We are therefore of the opinion that the High Court was clearly in error in holding that the accused was guilty of the offence of murder under Section 302, I. P. C. On the materials placed on the record it could not be held proved that he had any intention of firing at the Mahant. He seems to have pulled the trigger without aiming at the Mahant in a state of intoxication in order to see that by the gun fire the Mahant was prevented from leaving his place. It was a wholly rash and negligent act on his part or at the worst was an act which would amount to manslaughter. It could not be held to constitute an offence of murder. No intention of causing death or an intention of causing such bodily injury as being sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death could be ascribed to the accused or readily inferred in the circumstances of this case.	Precedent
6. The version given by Amar Singh, P. W. 9, in court during the trial and on which the conviction of the appellant is based is wholly inconsistent and contradictory to the version he narrated at the time he made the first information report within a few hours of the incident. The narrative given by him during the trial is in these terms :
It is apparent that this witness also tried to exaggerate and made a deliberate effort to improve on the earlier story so that the offence of murder against the accused might be held proved.
On all these points the testimony of the eye-witnesses is consistent and unanimous. The only difference between their statements is that they are not all agreed as to the exact stage at which the appellant went out of the chubara and the precise words that he and the deceased exchanged. In my opinion, the differences are not only not material but they can be easily explained."
13. The result therefore is that we allow this appeal, set aside the decision of the courts below and hold the appellant guilty of the offence under Section 304A, I. P. C. In our opinion, the sentence already undergone by him is sufficient to meet the ends of justice and we therefore direct that he be released forthwith. Even if the offence were to be regarded as falling under Section 304, I. P. C., we would not have awarded him a severer punishment than the imprisonment that he has already undergone.	Conclusion
1. This appeal which comes by special leave obtained by the appellant Sadhu Singh, is from a decision of a Division Bench of the High Court of Patiala dated 2-6-1952 by which the sentence of transportation for life passed against him for the murder of one Harbachan Singh was affirmed.
2. The facts are, that on 29-10-1949 Harbachan Singh, deceased, went to village Bihla because he intended to borrow a camel from Nand Singh, P. W. 4. P. Ws. Chand Singh and Amar Singh accompanied him to Bihla and the party reached there between 7 and 8 P.M. On arrival at Nand Singh's house it was found that he had gone to the house of Sadhu Singh. Nand Singh's son was asked to go to Sadhu Singh's house and call Nand Singh from there. Nand Singh's son returned with a message from his father inviting the party to Sadhu Singh's house. Accordingly they all went there and found Nand Singh in the midst of a liquor party. The appellant's father Harnam Singh was also there.

The deceased Mahant did not like this and returned the opium that he had taken and got ready to leave the place along with his companions. As soon as he came out of the room he was hit by gunshot in the chest. He was mortally wounded and fell down.
Chand Singh and Amar Singh went to the police station and lodged the first information report at 12-30 A.M. on the 30th. On the basis of this report a case was registered against the accused under Section 338, I. P. C. It was then thought by the police that the accused was guilty of a rash and negligent act endangering human life and personal safety. During the pendency of this case, Harbachan Singh died as a result of the injuries caused by the accused and the charge against him was then changed into one under Section 304A, I. P. C. Later on, it appears that some further change was made in the chalan and the offence was changed into one under Section 302, I. P. C.

He accordingly framed a charge against him under that section. He also held that there was no 'prima facie' case against the accused under Section 302 and in these circumstances there was no sufficient ground for committing him to the court of session. In the result, the accused was convicted under Section 304A, I. P.

3. Against this order an application in revision was made to the Sessions Judge, Barnala, by the Public Prosecutor and another similar application was made by the heirs of Harbachan Singh. The learned Sessions Judge was not prepared to allow these applications and rejected them. Then two applications for revision were made to the High Court against both the orders of the Additional District Magistrate, viz., the order discharging Sadhu Singh of the offence of murder and also the order convicting him under Section 304A, I. P. C. The High Court in revision set aside both the orders of the Additional District Magistrate and remanded the case to him with a direction that he should frame a proper charge and commit the accused to the Sessions for trial. In accordance with this direction the Magistrate committed the accused to the Court of Session.
4. The learned Sessions Judge accepted the evidence of the three eye-witnesses, P. Ws. 3, 4 and 9, and held that Sadhu Singh, the accused, fired his gun at the deceased with the intention of causing death or such bodily injury as would suffice in the ordinary course of nature to cause death and that he was guilty of the offence under Section 302, I. P. C. He, however, held that the accused's mind was affected by drink and he more readily gave way to violent passion and that the ends of justice would be sufficiently met if he was given transportation for life. A recommendation was made to the local Government to commute the sentence into a shorter term of imprisonment. On appeal, the conviction of the appellant as well as the sentence were maintained.
5. As already stated, the conviction of the appellant for the offences under Section 302, I. P. C., mainly rests on the version of the incident as given by the three eye-witnesses, P. Ws. 3, 4 and 9. P. Ws. 3 and 4 are the two persons who had accompanied the deceased Mahant and also accompanied him to Sadhu Singh's house, and later on followed him when he got ready to leave the house. Amar Singh and Chand Singh are not in any way connected with or related to Sadhu Singh. They had only gone there in the company of the Mahant and came out with him. Both of them went to the police station and arrived there at 12-30 A.M. on the 30th October, the incident having taken place on the 29th October at about 8 P.M. The Mahant having met his end in the manner stated above, evidently these two persons immediately after the incident could have no possible reason to shield the culprit in any manner whatsoever or to give a coloured version of the incident in order to minimise his offence.
In the first information report given by Amar Singh in the presence of Chand Singh the version as to how the deceased Mahant met his end is in these terms :
Amar Singh's and Chand Singh's version of the incident was that the death of the Mahant was accidental. It was not said in this report that Sadhu Singh was present at the time when Harnam Singh protested that there was no opium left in the tin for him to eat and when the Mahant returned the opium tin to him. On the other hand, it was clearly stated that this happened between Harbachan Singh Mahant and Harnam Singh, while Sadhu Singh was strolling outside the chubara carrying his gun with him in a state of intoxication. It is not even suggested in this report that Sadhu Singh heard this talk or became aware of the altercation between his father and the Mahant and showed resentment at the Mahant leaving his place in that fashion. Amar Singh did not in this statement say that he had seen the accused aiming at the Mahant and firing at him. All that he said was that all of a sudden report of a gun fire was heard and the Mahant was found to have been shot.
6. The version given by Amar Singh, P. W. 9, in court during the trial and on which the conviction of the appellant is based is wholly inconsistent and contradictory to the version he narrated at the time he made the first information report within a few hours of the incident. The narrative given by him during the trial is in these terms :
As the witness deposed that when he went to the police station his statement was not recorded, in cross-examination he was asked the following question :
To further questions in cross-examination the witness stated as follows :
7. It is clear from this statement that as regards the nature and character of the act of Sadhu Singh there was a complete change from the version given by this witness immediately after the occurrence and the one given by him in the court of the committing magistrate and at the trial. This change in the chain of events as to how they happened goes to the root of the case. According to the earlier version, the death was accidental or in all likelihood, caused by a rash and negligent act on the part of the accused, while according to the later version, it was a clear case of intentional murder. Herein it was made out that after an altercation between Sadhu Singh and the Mahant, Sadhu Singh loaded the gun, aimed it at the Mahant and fired at him.
As we have already said, Amar Singh was not connected in any way with Sadhu Singh. He was one of the persons who formed the party of the deceased Mahant and no satisfactory explanation whatsoever has been furnished on the record why he of all persons would have given a garbled or coloured version of the incident in order to protect or shield Sadhu Singh from the natural consequences of his act. The only explanation the witness attempted to give during the trial was that the statement recorded in the first information report was not recorded at the time when he gave the report but was taken subsequently. This explanation is, on the face of it, untrue and has been proved to be so by the statement of his companion Chand Singh, P. W. 3, and the Sub-Inspector of Police, who positively stated that the first information report was signed by Amar Singh at 12-30 A.M. on the 30th morning. The cross-examination of the witness shows the extent of his prevarications on very material aspects of the incident, and the manner in which it happened.
8. Chand Singh, P. W. 3, who accompanied Amar Singh, at the trial supported in the main the narrative of the incident given by Amar Singh. This is what he said about the actual act and conduct of the accused in firing with his gun :
This witness has not supported the version of Amar Singh that the gun was loaded at that very moment before it was fired and in the presence of the witnesses. In cross-examination this witness made the following significant statement :
He further said-
In the statement of the witness recorded under Section 164, Cr. P. C. on this important question, he said as follows :
It is apparent that from the stage of the first information report to the final stage of the trial the witness has been giving different accounts of the actual happening. At the earlier stage it was not said that Sadhu Singh was present at the talk between his father and the Mahant which created some resentment between them, or that Sadhu Singh aimed the gun at the Mahant after loading it in the presence of the witness, or that he told him that he would not let him go as in the past he had not allowed anybody to leave his house in this fashion. There is a clear attempt on the part of the witness to make it appear that the firing which was either accidental or an act of bravado on the part of the accused in order to stop the Mahant from leaving his house, was an act of intentional killing.
9. The last witness on this point is Nand Singh, P. W. 4. On the point as to how the incident actually happened he stated as follows:
In cross-examination the witness, however, said as follows:
In his statement before the police, Ex. D. A., the version given by this witness is as follows:
It is apparent that this witness also tried to exaggerate and made a deliberate effort to improve on the earlier story so that the offence of murder against the accused might be held proved.
10. On a careful reading of the evidence of the eye-witnesses and the different statements that have been made by them it is quite clear that the incident happened in a very short time and suddenly. There was no previous enmity between the deceased and the accused. On the other hand, the accused was very respectful to the Mahant and was over-anxious to show all hospitality to him. It seems that he was anxious that the Mahant should not go away from his house without taking meals and spending the night with him, and seeing that the Mahant was going away, in all probability he let go his gun without aiming it at the Mahant in order to prevent him from leaving his place by terrifying him to some extent. It is not possible to believe the embellished version of the witnesses that Sadhu Singh was present at the altercation between his father and the Mahant or that he loaded the gun after he himself had intervened in the altercation, or that there was the conversation alleged by the witness between him and the Mahant. It also appears that the story that the accused took aim before firing at the Mahant or that he said that he had never allowed in the past anybody to go like that from his house is a subsequent introduction in the case to add gravity to the offence committed by the accused.
11. In --'Pritam Singh v. The State', , this Court held that it will not grant special leave to appeal under Article 136(1) of the Constitution unless it is shown that exceptional and special circumstances exist, that substantial and grave injustice has been done and the case in question presents features of sufficient gravity to warrant a review of the decision appealed against and that only those points can be urged at the final hearing of the appeal which are fit to be urged at the preliminary stage when leave is asked for. It is well established that this court does not by special leave convert itself into a court to review evidence for a third time. Where, however, the court below fails in apprehending the true effect of a material change in the versions given by the witnesses immediately after the occurrence and the narrative at the trial with respect to the nature and character of the offence, it seems to us that in such a situation it would not be right for this court to affirm such a decision when it occasions a failure of justice. While dealing with this question the High Court made the following significant observations:
On all these points the testimony of the eye-witnesses is consistent and unanimous. The only difference between their statements is that they are not all agreed as to the exact stage at which the appellant went out of the chubara and the precise words that he and the deceased exchanged. In my opinion, the differences are not only not material but they can be easily explained."
12. It seems to us that the High Court was in error in thinking that there was not a single difference between the statements made by the witnesses in the first information report and the statements made at the trial, which went to the root of the case. As above pointed out, the whole version as to the nature and character of the act of the accused had been completely changed. An act which on the facts stated in the first information report and on the statements made to the police may well be regarded either accidental or rash and negligent, has been deliberately made to look like an act of deliberate murder. If such a difference does not go to the root of the case it is difficult to conceive what else can fall within that class of cases. We are therefore of the opinion that the High Court was clearly in error in holding that the accused was guilty of the offence of murder under Section 302, I. P. C. On the materials placed on the record it could not be held proved that he had any intention of firing at the Mahant. He seems to have pulled the trigger without aiming at the Mahant in a state of intoxication in order to see that by the gun fire the Mahant was prevented from leaving his place. It was a wholly rash and negligent act on his part or at the worst was an act which would amount to manslaughter. It could not be held to constitute an offence of murder. No intention of causing death or an intention of causing such bodily injury as being sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death could be ascribed to the accused or readily inferred in the circumstances of this case.
13. The result therefore is that we allow this appeal, set aside the decision of the courts below and hold the appellant guilty of the offence under Section 304A, I. P. C. In our opinion, the sentence already undergone by him is sufficient to meet the ends of justice and we therefore direct that he be released forthwith. Even if the offence were to be regarded as falling under Section 304, I. P. C., we would not have awarded him a severer punishment than the imprisonment that he has already undergone.
