ORIGINAL JURISDICTION: Petitions Nos. 4,36 and 37 of 1958. Petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution of India for enforcement of Fundamental Rights.	Issue
1961. March 14. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR, J.-These are three petitions under Art. 32 of the Constitution challenging the imposition of sales tax on betel leaves by the Sales Tax Officer, Akola. The question raised in all the three petitions is the same and can conveniently be disposed of by one judgment. The petitioners in the three petitions are dealers in betel leaves at Akola, now in the State of Maharashtra and at the relevant time in the State of Madhya Pradesh. The Assistant Sales Tax Officer at Akola assessed the petitioners under the provisions of the C. P. & Berar Sales Tax Act, 1947 (Act XXI of 1947), hereinafter termed the "Act" to the payment of gales tax as follows:	Facts
R. Ganapathy Iyer and K. L. Hathi, for the petitioners. C. K. Paphtary, Solicitor General of India, B. R. L. Iyengar an(! P. M. Sen, for the respondents.	RespArg
ingly."
Thus under the Act all articles mentioned in the Schedule were exempt from Sales Tax and articles not so specified were taxable. In the Schedule applicable there were originally two items which are relevant for the purposes of the case. They were items Nos. 6 and 36:
In that case the word "vegetables" was construed and in our opinion correctly construed in relation to the very provisions of the Act which are now in controversy before us. In cases under the U. P. Sales Tax Act betel leaves have been held not to be within the expression "green vegetables"; Brahma Nand v. The State, of Uttar Pradesh(3); Firm Shri Krishna Chaudhry V. Commissioner of Sales Tax (4). In Bhairondon Tolaram v. The State of Rajasthan (5) they were held not to be plants and in Kokil Ram & Sons v. The State of Bihar (6), it was held that vegetables meant plants cultivated for food and Paw are not foodstuffs. in Dharamdas Paul v. Commissioner of Commercial (1) (1952) 1 Bom. L.R. 385. 389.	Precedent
(3) [1956]7 S.T.C 2o6.
(5) [1957] 8 S.T.C. 798.
(2) [1956]7 S.T.C. 99, 102.
(4) [1956] 7 S.T.C. 742.
In our view, betel leaves are not exempt from taxation. Those petitions therefore fail and are dismissed with costs. One hearing fee.
Petitions dismissed.	Conclusion

(6) [1949]1 S.T.C. 217 Taxes also they were held not to be vegetables which specifically meant Sabzi, Tarkari and Sak. Therefore &part from the fact that the legislature by using two distinct and different items i.e. item 6 "vegetables" and item No. 36 "betel leaves" has indicated its intention, decided cases also show that the word "vegetables" in taxing statutes is to be understood as in common parlance i.e. denoting class of vegetables which are grown in a kitchen garden or in a farm and are used for the table.
In our view, betel leaves are not exempt from taxation. Those petitions therefore fail and are dismissed with costs. One hearing fee.
Petitions dismissed.	Total Judgement
