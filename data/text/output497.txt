S. P. Verma for the appellant.	PetArg
C. P. Lal for the respondent.	RespArg
By a curious misreading of the evidence this Nanhu Singh was mixed up with Bechan Singh. What the High Court really meant to do was to convict Bechan Singh and acquit Nanhu Singh. Instead of that they acquitted Bechan Singh and convicted Nanhu Singh. As soon as the learned High Court Judges realised their mistake they communicated with the State Government and an order was thereupon passed by that Government remitting the sentence mistakenly Passed on Nanhu and directing that he be released.
This occasioned an application under article 134(1) (c) of the Constitution by Nanhu Singh and the two appellants Nar Singh and Roshan Singh for a certificate. The High Court rightly considered that the certificate should issue in the case of Nanhu Singh because, despite the remission of his sentence by the State Government and his release, his conviction on, among other things, a charge of murder still stood, and the High Court, understandably, thought that the stigma of that might affect him adversely in the future. As regards the other two there was nothing in their cases to warrant the issue of a certificate but the learned High Court Judges thought (wrongly in our opinion) that they were bound to do so because article 134(1) (c) speaks of a " case " and they considered that the only CC case " before them was the appeal as a whole. That, in our opinion, is wrong.
In the present case, the learned High Court Judges thought they had no option. They misdirected themselves about the law and as a consequence did not exercise the discretion which is vested in them. They are quite clear as to what they would have done if, in their judgment, the law had left them scope for the exercise of any discretion, for they say-	Precedent
These are the well known lines on which questions of discretion are dealt with in the superior Courts and they apply with as much force to certificates under article 134(1) (c) as elsewhere.
We hold therefore that the certificate was wrongly granted to the appellants and will treat their case as one under article 136(1) for special leave.
We see no reason to interfere with the sentences. A number of persons joined in an attack at two in the morning on helpless persons who were asleep in bed. At least one of the assailants was armed either with a gun or a pistol. He shot one man dead and attempted to murder another, and the band looted their property. The sentences of two years, four years and transportation are therefore not severe and call for no review.
The appeal fails and is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.

1954. May 5. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BOSE J.-Twenty-four persons, among them the two appellants, were tried for offences under sections 148, 307/149 and 302/149, Indian Penal Code. Sixteen were acquitted and the remainmg eight were convicted. On appeal to the High Court five more were acquitted and the only ones whose convictions were upheld were the two appellants, Nar Singh and Roshan Singh, and one Nanhu Singh.
By a curious misreading of the evidence this Nanhu Singh was mixed up with Bechan Singh. What the High Court really meant to do was to convict Bechan Singh and acquit Nanhu Singh. Instead of that they acquitted Bechan Singh and convicted Nanhu Singh. As soon as the learned High Court Judges realised their mistake they communicated with the State Government and an order was thereupon passed by that Government remitting the sentence mistakenly Passed on Nanhu and directing that he be released.
This occasioned an application under article 134(1) (c) of the Constitution by Nanhu Singh and the two appellants Nar Singh and Roshan Singh for a certificate. The High Court rightly considered that the certificate should issue in the case of Nanhu Singh because, despite the remission of his sentence by the State Government and his release, his conviction on, among other things, a charge of murder still stood, and the High Court, understandably, thought that the stigma of that might affect him adversely in the future. As regards the other two there was nothing in their cases to warrant the issue of a certificate but the learned High Court Judges thought (wrongly in our opinion) that they were bound to do so because article 134(1) (c) speaks of a " case " and they considered that the only CC case " before them was the appeal as a whole. That, in our opinion, is wrong.
These are the well known lines on which questions of discretion are dealt with in the superior Courts and they apply with as much force to certificates under article 134(1) (c) as elsewhere.
In the present case, the learned High Court Judges thought they had no option. They misdirected themselves about the law and as a consequence did not exercise the discretion which is vested in them. They are quite clear as to what they would have done if, in their judgment, the law had left them scope for the exercise of any discretion, for they say-
We hold therefore that the certificate was wrongly granted to the appellants and will treat their case as one under article 136(1) for special leave.
Regarded from that angle, this is not a proper case for special leave. The High Court gives a clear finding that there were more than five persons and believes the eye- witnesses who identify the two appellants. The mere fact that only two out of the band of attackers were satisfactorily identified does not weaken the force of the finding that more than five were involved. The use of section 149, Indian Penal Code, was therefore justified and the convictions are proper.
We see no reason to interfere with the sentences. A number of persons joined in an attack at two in the morning on helpless persons who were asleep in bed. At least one of the assailants was armed either with a gun or a pistol. He shot one man dead and attempted to murder another, and the band looted their property. The sentences of two years, four years and transportation are therefore not severe and call for no review.
The appeal fails and is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
