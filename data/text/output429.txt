Tolaram Relumal And Another vs The State Of Bombay on 13 May, 1954	Case Title
CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 18 of 1953.
Appeal under article 134(1)(c) of the Constitution of India from the Judgment and Order dated the 18th February, 1953, of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in Criminal Appeal No. 592 of 1952 arising out of the Judgment and Order dated the 21st May, 1952, of the Court of the Presidency Magistrate, 19th Court, Bombay, in Case No. 147/P/ 1951.
On return from the Full Bench, the Division Bench considered the other contentions raised on behalf of the appellants and held that there were no merits in any one of those points and in the result the appeal was dismissed. It was certified that the case involved a substantial question of law and was a fit one for appeal to this Court. This appeal is before us on that certificate, The principal question to decide in the appeal is whether the answer given by the Full Bench to the question referred to it is right, and whether receipt of a sum of money by a person who enters into an executory contract to grant a lease of a building under construction falls within the mischief of section 18(1) of the Act Section 18(1) provides:	Issue

It may further be pointed out that, in fact, in this case the lease never came into existence. Moreover, in view of the provisions contained in the Bombay Land Requisition Act XXXIII of 1948, as amended, the appellants could not let out the building even after its completion unless on a proper notice being given the Controller of Accommodation did not exercise his powers under that Act. It so happened that as soon as the building was completed the Controller of Accom- modation requisitioned it, and thus no occasion arose for giving effect to the executory contract.	PetArg
100. The fourth accused, Roshanlal Kanjilal, was acquitted. Mathra Das preferred no appeal against his conviction and sentence. The appellants preferred an appeal to the High Court against their conviction. This was heard by Gajendragadkar and Chainani JJ. on the 8th of October, 1952. It was contended, inter alia, that even if it were held that the appellants had -accepted the sum of Rs. 2,400 they could not be said to have committed an offence under section 18(1) of the Act inasmuch as the amount could not in law be held to be a premium in respect of the grant of -a lease. On this point the learned Judged said as follows :-
A contrary view had been expressed in Criminal Revision No. 1178 of 1949, by another Bench of the High Court on the construction of section 18(1). The matter was therefore referred to the Full Bench. The question framed for the consideration of the Full Bench was in these terms:-
The question that needs our determination in such a situation is Whether section 18(1) makes punishable receipt of money at a moment of time when the lease had not come into existence, and when there was a possibility that the contemplated lease might never come into existence. It may be here observed that the provisions of section 18(1) are penal in nature and it is a well settled rule of construction of penal statutes that if two possible and reasonable constructions can be put upon a penal provision, the Court must lean towards that construction which exempts the subject from penalty rather than the one which imposes penalty. It if; not competent to the Court to stretch the meaning of an expression used by the Legislature in order to carry out the intention of the Legislature. As pointed out by Lord Macmillan in London and North Eastern Railway Co. v. Berriman(1), " where penalties for infringement are imposed it is not legitimate to stretch the language of a rule, however beneficent its intention, beyond the fair and ordinary meaning of its language."
The High Court took the view that without stretching the language of section 18(1) beyond its fair and ordinary meaning, the very comprehensive expression " in respect of "	Precedent
1954. May 13. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MEHR CHAND MAHAJAN C.J.-The appellants were charged under section 18(1) of the Bombay Rent I Restriction Act, 1947, for receiving from Shankar Das Gupta through Mathra Das, accused No. 3, on 23rd November, 1950, a sum of Rs. 2,400 as premium or pugree in respect of the grant of lease of Block No. 15 in a building under construction. The magistrate found 'the appellants guilty of the charge and sentenced each of them to two months' R.I. and a fine of Rs. 1,200. Mathra Das was convicted and sentenced to one day's S.I. and a fine of Rs.
in the manner indicated by the section Under the section the money must be received by the landlord in respect of the grant of a lease. The section refers to the " grant, renewal or continuance of a lease." Prima facie, it would not cover an executory agreement to grant a lease. The words " renewal or continuance of a lease " clearly suggest that there must be a renewal or continuance of a subsisting lease. In the context, grant of tenancy means the grant of new or initial tenancy; renewal of tenancy means the grant of tenancy after its termination; and continuance seems to contemplate continuance of a tenancy which is existing. Whether or not an executory agreement for grant of a lease comes within the ambit of the section by reason of the use of the words " in respect of " would be examined hereinafter. Before doing so it may be stated that an instrument is usually construed as a lease if it contains words of present demise. It is construed as an executory agreement, notwithstanding that it contains words of present demise, where certain things have to be done by the lessor before the lease is granted, such as the completion or repair or improvement of the premises, or by the lessee, such as the obtaining of sureties. (Vide Halsbury's Laws of England, Second Edition, Vol. 20, pp. 37-39). On the facts of this case therefore the Full Bench very rightly held that the oral, agreement made between the parties did not constitute a lease but it amounted to an agreement to grant a lease in future.
The section does not make the intention punishable; it makes an act punishable which act is related to the existence of a lease. It does not make receipt of money on an executory contract punishable; on the other hand it only makes receipt of money on the grant, renewal or continuance of the lease of any premises punishable and unless the lease come into existence no offence can be said to have been committed by the person receiving the money. It is difficult to hold that any relationship of 'landlord and tenant comes into existence on the execution of at agreement executory in nature or that the expression " premium " can be appositely used in connection with the receipt of money on the occasion of the executor of such an agreement, It may well be that if a leas( actually comes into existence then any receipt of money which has a nexus with that lease may fall within the mischief of section 18(1), but it is unnecessary to ex press any final opinion on the question as in the present case admittedly no lease ever came into existence and the relationship of landlord and tenant was never created between the parties. The landlord never became entitled to receive the rent from the tenant and the tenant never became liable to pay the rent. There was no transfer of interest in the premises from the landlord to the tenant. On its plain, natural, grammatic meaning, the language of the section does not warrant the construction placed upon it by the Full Bench merely by laying emphasis on the words " in respect of." In our opinion the language of the section ;'in respect of the grant, renewal or continuance of a lease "
also suggests the same construction. Landlord " as defined in section 5 of the Act means any person who is for the time being receiving, or entitled to receive, rent in respect of any premises whether on his own account or on account, or on behalf, or for the benefit, of any other person, or as a trustee, guardian or receiver for any other person or who would so receive the rent or be entitled to receive the rent if the premises were let to a tenant............ It is obvious that on the basis of an executory agreement the appellants would not be entitled to receive any rent. They would only be entitled to receive rent after the lease is executed and actual demise of the premises or their transfer is made in favour of the complainant. The definition of the expression tenant" also suggests the same construction. Mr. Mehta for the State, besides supporting the emphasis placed by the High Court on the words " in respect of,"
It was suggested that but for this exception the executory agreement would be included within the mischief of section 18(1) and that unless such agreements were within the mischief of the section there would have been no point in exempting them from its provisions. In our view, this contention is not sound. In the first place, the exception was added to the section by Act 42 of 1951, subsequent to the agreement in question, and for the purposes of this case section 18(1) should ordinarily be read as it stood in the Act, at the time the offence is alleged to have been commit- ted. Be that as it may, it appears that sub-section (3) was added to the section by reason of the fact that some Courts construed section 18(1) in the manner in which it has been construed by the Full Bench in this case, and the Legislature by enacting clause (3) made it clear that agreements of the nature indicated in the subjection were never intended to be included therein. In our opinion, the language of that section is not of much assistance in construing the main provisions of section 18(1).	Section
The result therefore is that in our view the receipt of money by the appellants from the complainant at the time of the oral executory agreement of lease was not made punishable under section 18(1) of the Act and is outside its mischief, and the Presidency Magistrate was in error in convicting the appellants and the High Court was also in error in upholding their conviction. We accordingly allow this appeal, set aside the conviction of the appellants and order that they be acquitted.
Appeal allowed.	Conclusion
