Re. (3): Learned counsel for the petitioner advanced a forcible argument questioning the validity of condition 2(i)(a) of the notification on the ground that it infringed Art. 14 of the Constitution. Elaborating his argument, the learned counsel stated that the said condition classified members of the Indian Stock Exchange Limited into two groups, one active members and the other who were not active members, and that that classification was arbitrary and had no reasonable relation to the object sought to be achieved by the notification. He further pointed out that the defining of active members as those who had themselves transacted business regularly on the floor of the Indian Stock Exchange Limited either on their own account or on account of their clients for 12 months immediately preceding August 6, 1957, was not only arbitrary and vague but also, if analysed, would lead to anomalies destructive of any standard of reasonableness. It is alleged in the affidavit filed by the petitioner that from the inception of the Indian Stock Exchange Limited, 199 members of the said Stock Exchange were actually trading on the floor of the said Exchange from time to time but for some reason or the other were not trading during the period of 12 months immediately preceding August 6, 1957; that there were 34 members of the said Stock Exchange who were regularly transacting business on the floor of the said Stock Exchange prior to August 6, 1956, and for some time after August 6, 1956, but not during the entire period of 12 months from August 6, 1956 to August 6, 1957; and that there were 24 members of the said Stock Exchange who started transacting business regularly on the floor of the said Stock Exchange some time after August 6, 1956 and continued to transact business right upto and after August 6, 1957. It was asked what was the reasonable basis for confining the definition of active members to those who were carrying on business during the period of 12 months from August 6, 1956 to August 6, 1957, while excluding the aforesaid three categories who were equally active members and indeed more active than those included in the definition. It was further asked what was the justification for excluding a member who was an active member for years before the crucial year and irregularly conducted business on the floor of the Stock Exchange during the crucial year while including a member who might have been a newcomer or who might have been earlier a nominal member but began to do business regularly only during the said year. Emphasis was also laid upon the alleged elastic and indefinite content of the word " regular " and it was suggested that the said word could not possibly afford a precise standard. These are all weighty con- siderations and we must confess that there is force in them. But there is the other side of the picture. It is well- settled that a classification must have reasonable relation to the object sought to be achieved. The standard of reasonableness is inextricably conditioned by the extent and nature of the evil and the urgency for eradicating the same. The object of the notification is twofold. The main object is to carry out the purpose of the Act, namely, to prevent undesirable transactions in securities by regulating the business in them. The subsidiary object is to assuage the hardship that recognition of only one stock exchange would cause to the members of the other association. To achieve this twin object the classification is made between active members and inactive members. While on the one hand the Government found it necessary to exclude the nominal members who would add their deadweight to the recognised association and bring down its efficiency and affect its disciplined conduct of business, on the other hand it gave opportunity to persons who were actively interested in the business to become regular members of the Stock Exchange, Bombay. There is every justification for excluding members who had not been taking active interest in the business, for, as we have already pointed out, the efficient carrying out of the business of the Stock Exchange depends upon the moral stature, high caliber, and genuine and active interest evinced by the members. The active members justified themselves to the preferential treatment by their sustained interest in the business whereas the members who were not active showed their continued indifference to that line of business. But the crux of the question is, what is the justification for fixing twelve months immediately preceding August 6, 1957, as the standard for active membership ? The Under Secretary to the Govern- ment of India, Ministry of Finance, filed an affidavit describing the circumstances whereunder this classification was made. It discloses that the notification was issued after taking into consideration the representations made on behalf of both the Stock Exchanges and also the facts pertaining to the course of business conducted by the Indian Stock Exchange Limited. It also gives the vicissitudes through which the said Stock Exchange passed from the date of its formation and the circumstances under which the membership of that Exchange was divided into full members and associate members. It points out that the Indian Stock Exchange Limited became moribund in a few years and to revive its activities it allowed the members of the East India Chamber of Commerce, by relaxing its entrance fee and security deposit requirements in 1950-51 and created a new class of Associate Members, which facilitated the enrollment of hundreds of Associate Members on payment of a nominal entrance fee of Rs. 100. The Government on a consideration of the necessary data and presumably having regard to the record of the activities of the various members fixed the activities in the crucial year 1956-57 as the standard of activity for membership.	Facts
4(1) no doubt shall be such as may be imposed by the Government, having regard to the aforesaid three considerations, but they need not necessarily be confined only to the said considerations. The Government may impose any conditions, no doubt germane to the recognition of a stock exchange, after consultation with its governing board, and having regard to the said considerations. It cannot be said that condition 2(i)(a) imposed on the Stock Exchange is not a condition germane to its recognition. The record discloses that the Central Government in recognising the Stock Exchange sought to avoid the consequential hardship on the members of the rival stock exchange and therefore imposed the said condition on the Stock Exchange, Bombay, as a condition for its recognition. The condition is germane to recognition of the Stock Exchange and is, therefore, a condition within the meaning of " any other conditions " in cl. (b) of sub-s. (1) of s. 4 of the Act.	RespArg
Rule 54 is to the following effect:
(a) that the rules and bye-laws of a stock exchange applying for registration are in conformity with such conditions as may be prescribed with a view to ensure fair dealing and to protect investors;
It may grant recognition to the stock exchange subject to the conditions imposed upon it as aforesaid and in such form as may be prescribed.	Precedent
Rule 11 is as follows..
Appendix B gives the nomination forms Nos. 1 and 2 to be filled by a member or a legal representative, as the case may be, under r. 11 (a) and (b). Now it would be convenient to read rr. 20 and 21. They are as follows:
To put it in other words, under the Rules candidates for admission fall under three groups, viz., (1) candidates falling under r. 11, (a) and (b); (2) candidates applying for membership vesting in the Exchange; and (3) other candidates. All the three categories of candidates must be recommended by two members. But the candidates belonging to the first category shall in addition be nominated in the manner provided by the Rules. We, therefore, hold that the Stock Exchange Rules do not operate as a bar against the petitioner becoming a member of the Stock Exchange subject to the rules governing such application. The petitioner has the right to do business in shares: in spite of the notifications he can still do business in spot delivery contracts. He can apply to become a member of the Stock Exchange subject to the conditions laid down by the Rules. The Act the validity of which he has not chosen to question, enables the State to give or refuse recognition to any Stock Exchange and it has chosen to give recognition to the Stock Exchange, Bombay, subject to the conditions prescribed. The restrictions, in our view, are not unreasonable, having regard to the importance of the business of a stock exchange in the country's national economy and having regard to the magnitude of the mischief sought to be remedied in the interest of the general public. At another place we have already dealt with the necessity for stringent rules governing this type of business For the reasons Mentioned we reject the first contention.
Re. (2): The second contention also has no merits. The criticism is that condition 2(i) (a) annexed to the notification cannot be supported on the basis of any of the provisions of s. 4 of the Act. Condition 2 (i) reads as follows:
Section 4: " (1) If the Central Government is satisfied, after making such inquiry as may be necessary in this behalf and after obtaining such further information, if any, as it may require,-
(c) that it would be in the interest of the trade and also in the public interest to grant recognition to the stock exchange;
(2) The conditions which the Central Government may prescribe under clause (a) of sub-section (1) for the grant of recognition to the stock exchanges may include, among other matters, conditions relating. to,--	Section
(i) the qualifications for membership of stock exchanges;
(ii) the manner in which contracts shall be entered into and enforced as between members;
Petition dismissed.	Conclusion

1960. August 17. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SUBBA RAO J.-This is a petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution for the issue of a writ of mandamus or a writ in the nature of mandamus or any other appropriate direction, order or writ to direct the respondent, the Union of India, to withdraw or cancel the notification dated August 31, 1957, recognising " the Stock Exchange, Bombay "
Rule 54 is to the following effect:
Rule 11 is as follows..
Appendix B gives the nomination forms Nos. 1 and 2 to be filled by a member or a legal representative, as the case may be, under r. 11 (a) and (b). Now it would be convenient to read rr. 20 and 21. They are as follows:

At another place we have already dealt with the necessity for stringent rules governing this type of business For the reasons Mentioned we reject the first contention.
Re. (2): The second contention also has no merits. The criticism is that condition 2(i) (a) annexed to the notification cannot be supported on the basis of any of the provisions of s. 4 of the Act. Condition 2 (i) reads as follows:
Explanation:" Active Members " for purpose of this condition means members who have themselves transacted business regularly on the floor of the Indian Stock Exchange Limited either on their own account or on account of their clients. To appreciate the argument it is also necessary to read the material provisions of s. 4 of the Act.
Section 4: " (1) If the Central Government is satisfied, after making such inquiry as may be necessary in this behalf and after obtaining such further information, if any, as it may require,-
(a) that the rules and bye-laws of a stock exchange applying for registration are in conformity with such conditions as may be prescribed with a view to ensure fair dealing and to protect investors;
(b) that the stock exchange is willing to comply with any other conditions (including conditions as to the number of members) which the Central Government after consultation with the governing body of the stock exchange and having regard to the area served by the stock exchange and its standing and the nature of the securities dealt with by it, may impose for the purpose of carrying, out the objects of this Act; and
(c) that it would be in the interest of the trade and also in the public interest to grant recognition to the stock exchange;
It may grant recognition to the stock exchange subject to the conditions imposed upon it as aforesaid and in such form as may be prescribed.
(2) The conditions which the Central Government may prescribe under clause (a) of sub-section (1) for the grant of recognition to the stock exchanges may include, among other matters, conditions relating. to,--
(i) the qualifications for membership of stock exchanges;
(ii) the manner in which contracts shall be entered into and enforced as between members;
(iii) the representation of the Central Government on each of the stock exchanges by such number of persons not exceeding three as the Central Government may nominate in this behalf; and
(iv) the maintenance of accounts of members and their audit by chartered accountants whenever such audit is required by the Central Government. "
4(1) no doubt shall be such as may be imposed by the Government, having regard to the aforesaid three considerations, but they need not necessarily be confined only to the said considerations. The Government may impose any conditions, no doubt germane to the recognition of a stock exchange, after consultation with its governing board, and having regard to the said considerations. It cannot be said that condition 2(i)(a) imposed on the Stock Exchange is not a condition germane to its recognition. The record discloses that the Central Government in recognising the Stock Exchange sought to avoid the consequential hardship on the members of the rival stock exchange and therefore imposed the said condition on the Stock Exchange, Bombay, as a condition for its recognition. The condition is germane to recognition of the Stock Exchange and is, therefore, a condition within the meaning of " any other conditions " in cl. (b) of sub-s. (1) of s. 4 of the Act.

It was asked what was the reasonable basis for confining the definition of active members to those who were carrying on business during the period of 12 months from August 6, 1956 to August 6, 1957, while excluding the aforesaid three categories who were equally active members and indeed more active than those included in the definition.

Emphasis was also laid upon the alleged elastic and indefinite content of the word " regular " and it was suggested that the said word could not possibly afford a precise standard. These are all weighty con- siderations and we must confess that there is force in them. But there is the other side of the picture. It is well- settled that a classification must have reasonable relation to the object sought to be achieved. The standard of reasonableness is inextricably conditioned by the extent and nature of the evil and the urgency for eradicating the same. The object of the notification is twofold. The main object is to carry out the purpose of the Act, namely, to prevent undesirable transactions in securities by regulating the business in them.

There is every justification for excluding members who had not been taking active interest in the business, for, as we have already pointed out, the efficient carrying out of the business of the Stock Exchange depends upon the moral stature, high caliber, and genuine and active interest evinced by the members. The active members justified themselves to the preferential treatment by their sustained interest in the business whereas the members who were not active showed their continued indifference to that line of business. But the crux of the question is, what is the justification for fixing twelve months immediately preceding August 6, 1957, as the standard for active membership ? The Under Secretary to the Govern- ment of India, Ministry of Finance, filed an affidavit describing the circumstances whereunder this classification was made. It discloses that the notification was issued after taking into consideration the representations made on behalf of both the Stock Exchanges and also the facts pertaining to the course of business conducted by the Indian Stock Exchange Limited. It also gives the vicissitudes through which the said Stock Exchange passed from the date of its formation and the circumstances under which the membership of that Exchange was divided into full members and associate members. It points out that the Indian Stock Exchange Limited became moribund in a few years and to revive its activities it allowed the members of the East India Chamber of Commerce, by relaxing its entrance fee and security deposit requirements in 1950-51 and created a new class of Associate Members, which facilitated the enrollment of hundreds of Associate Members on payment of a nominal entrance fee of Rs. 100. The Government on a consideration of the necessary data and presumably having regard to the record of the activities of the various members fixed the activities in the crucial year 1956-57 as the standard of activity for membership.
There is a presumption in favour of the State that there is a reasonable basis for the classification. Except the mere allegations in the affidavit which are not admitted, the petitioner has not placed before us any materials to ascertain that any other members, who were regularly doing business on the floor of the Indian Stock Exchange Limited before August 6,1956, temporarily suspended their business for one reason or other over which they had no control. No statement from the accounts has been produced to enable us to evaluate the activities of the members before the crucial date so as to enable us to form a view that really active members were excluded by the fixing of this period. Nor are we in a position to verify whether any of the members excluded were regularly doing business during a part of the year in continuation of their business in the earlier period. We cannot also say that the words "carrying on business regularly " are so vague that the parties did not understand their connotation, for it is admitted that some of the regular members applied for membership of the Stock Exchange, Bombay and most of them were admitted. There is also the fact that though three years have elapsed since the date of the notification no other member of the Indian Stock Exchange Limited thought fit to question the notification on the ground that the period fixed was unreasonable and that really active members were excluded from membership of the Stock Exchange, Bombay. So far as the petitioner is concerned, he was admittedly not an active member, though lie now pretends that he was doing business through other members. There is also no material placed before us to support the said assertion. If the classification, between active members and others who were not, is justifiable-we hold it is-the Government has to draw a line somewhere and to fix a period of activity reasonable in its opinion as a standard to satisfy the test of " active member ". The burden which lies upon the petitioner who impeaches the validity of the classification to show that it violates the guarantee of equal protection has not been discharged. On the material placed before us we cannot say that the period fixed by the Government as the standard for ascertaining the active membership is arbitrary or unreasonable. We must make it clear that this finding must be confined only to the validity of the impugned notification dated August 31, 1956. The petition accordingly fails and is dismissed with costs.
Petition dismissed.	Total Judgement
