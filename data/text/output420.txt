CIVIL APPEALATE, JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No.155 of 1953. Appeal by special leave from the Judgment and Order dated the 15th July, 1953, of the Election Tribunal, Nagpur, in Election Petition No. 3 of 1952.B. Sen and T. P. Naik for the appellant.
Thirteen candidates filed nomination papers, among them the petitioner. Of these, six contested the seat reserved for the Scheduled Castes. -One of these was Gangaram Thaware who has since died.
These proposals were sent to Moolji Sicka & Company for confirmation.	Issue
Veda Vyas (S. K. Kapur with him) for respondent No. 1. 1954. February 15. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Bose J.-This is an appeal against a decision of the Nagpur Election "Trbunal. The contest before the tribunal was about two seats in the Bhandara Parliamentary Constituency. The elections were held on five days 'in December, 1951, and January, 1952.
The Scheduled Caste in question is the Mahar caste. Objection was taken to Thaware's nomination for the reserved seat on the ground that he was not a Mahar. It is admitted that he was born a Mahar, but later in life he joined the Mabanubhava Panth. This, according to the appellant, is a sect which does not believe in caste, and alternatively that it forms a separate caste in itself The contention was that when Gangaram Thaware joined the Panth he ceased to be a member of the Mahar caste' The objection succeeded and his nomination was rejected.
The nomination of another Scheduled Caste candidate was also rejected and five others were withdrawn before the election, among them was the present petitioner. That left six candidates of whom three were eligible for the reserved seat.
Then between 15th November, 1951, and 14th. February, 1952, further orders for goods valued at Rs. 39,695-8-9 were placed And accepted and they were not paid for till after 14th February, 1952.
It was argued that there is nothing to show that. the goods were, not supplied before 15th November, 1951, and before 14th February, 1952. It was said on behalf of 'the appellant that these are the only dates which are crucial, so if Moolji Sicka.& Company hid. fully executed their part of the contracts before the two crucial dates the disqualification would not apply. That raises these questions: (1) Does a person who has fully executed his part of a contract continue to have an interest in it till the goods are paid for ?; and (2) were these contracts fully executed so far as Moolji Sicka & Company's part was concerned? The parties are not agreed about this, so it will now be necessary to examine their letters in detail to determine the terms of the various contracts. The correspondence discloses that the Canteen Stores and Moolji Sicka & Company dealt with each other from time to time under various arrangements which they called " systems. The earliest letter we have about the transactions between these parties is one dated 30th March, 1951. It shows that the "system" which they called the " Direct Supply System "	Facts
Now section 7(d) of the Representation of the People Act does not require that the contracts at which it strikes should be enforceable against the Government; all it requires. is that the contracts should be for the supply of goods to the Government. The contracts in question are just that and so are hit by the section.	RespArg
The two who were elected were Tularam Sakhare, for the Scheduled Caste seat, and chaturbhuj, Jasani, nor the general seat. Jasani's election was challenged on the ground that he was subject to the disqualifications set out in section 7 (d) of the Representation of the People Act (Act XLIII of 1951) as he was interested in a contract for the supply of goods to the Central Government. The Election Tribunal held that the rejection of Gangaram Thaware's nomination was improper as he continued to be a member of the Mahar caste despite his conversion to the tenets of the Mahanubhava. Panth. It also held that Chaturbhuj Jasani had a contract with the Central Government, so he was disqualified. Accordingly it set aside the whole election.
Chaturbhuj Jasani was, and still is, a partner in the firm of Moolji Sicka & Company, and it is said that at all material times the firm had- a contract for the supply of bidis to the Government for the troops.

(3)That the Pathankot and Srinagar Depots were to be supplied under another new system called the Outright Purchase System ";
(4)That during the "transition period" the "Direct Supply System" was to continue in operation " as at present " even with Moolji Sicka and Company.
(3) They said-
Regarding the guarantee they said they could not agree to six months but would agree to three provided the guarantee was limited to goods found to be defective because of faults in manufacture. They concluded-
Moolji Sicka & Company's reply is dated 9th August, 1951. They say-
The contention was that as these contracts were not expressed to be made by the President they are void. Cages were cited tons under the Government of India Acts of 1919 and 1935. Certain sections in these Acts were said to be similar to article 299. We do not think that they are, but in any case the rulings ,under section 30 (2) of the Government of India Act, 1915, as amended by the Government of India Act of 1919 disclose a difference of opinion. Thus, Krihsnaji Nilkant v. Secrtary of State(2) ruled that contracts with the Secretary of State must be by a deed executed on behalf of the Secretary of State for India and in his name. They cannot be made by correspondence or orally. Secretary of State v. Bhagwandas(3) and Devi Prasad Sri Krihhna Prasad Ltd. v. Secretary of State(1) held they could be made by correspondence. Secretary of State V. O.T. Sarin & Company(1) took an intermediate vie,* and held that though contracts in the prescribed form could not be enforced by either side, (1) 21 T.L.R. 319. (4) A.I.R. 1941 All. 377. (2) A.I.R. 1937 Bom. 449,451. (5) I.L.R. 11 Lah. 375. (3) A.I.R. 1938 Bom. 168.
a claim for compensation under section 70 of the Indian Contract Act would lie. Province of Bengal v. S. L. Puri(1) took a strict view and held that even letters headed "Government of India" did not comply with, the rule in section 175 (3) of the Government of India Act, 1935. The Federal Court was called upon to construe section 40 (1) of the Ninth Schedule of the Government of India Act, 1935. It held that the directions in it were only directory and not mandatory, and the same view was taken of article 166 (1) of the present Constitution by this court in Dattatreya Moreshwar Pangarkar v. State of Bombay(2). None of these provisions is quite the same as article 299. For example, -in article 166, as also in section 40(1) of the Government of India Act of 1935, there is a clause which says that "orders" and "instruments" and "other proceedings"
the initiated and to break off all former ties of caste and religion. Russell in Volume IV of his Tribes and Castes of the Central Provinces says that the Manbhaos (Mahanubhau) is a religious sect,or order which has " now" (1911) become a caste. The Central Provinces Ethnographic Survey, Volume IX, says the same thing at page 107 and at page 110 and adds that members of the sect often act as priests or gurus to the Mahars.
In our opinion, broadly speaking, the principles laid down by the Privy Council in the case of a Hindu convert to Christianity apply here: not, of course, the details of the decision but the broad underlying principle. In Abraham v. Abraham(1), their Lordships say:-
renounced, because here the right we are considering is the right of the old body, the right conferred on it as a special privilege to send a member of its own fold to Parliament. But with that modification the observations which follow. apply in their broad outline.	Precedent
We will deal with Chaturbhuj Jasani's election first. Section 7(d) is in these terms :
Moolji Sicka & Company is a firm of bidi manufacturers. The Central Government was interested in stocking and purchasing bidis for sale to its troops through its canteens. Accordingly, it placed two of the brands of bidis manufactured by this firm on its approved list and entered into an arrangement with the firm under which the firm was to sell, and the Government was to buy from the firm, from time to time, these two brands of bidis. It was argued that this amounted to a contract for the supply of goods within the meaning of the section. It was said that the contract was embodied in four letters.
We do not intend to analyse these letters in detail. here. It is enough to say that in our opinion no binding engagement can be spelt out of them except to this extent :
Consignment System ";
The purpose of the Act is to maintain the purity of the legislatures and to avoid a conflict between duty and interest. It is obvious that the temptation to place interest before duty is just as great when there is likely to be some difficulty in recovering the money from Government (for example, if Government were to choose not to ratify the contracts) as when there is none. In our opinion, the Election Tribunal was-right in disqualifying Chatturbhuj Jasani.	Section
It will be seen that the proposal about the " Consignment System " which the Canteen Stores made was that they would pay Moolji Sicka & Company only when they sold the stocks with which Moolji Sicka & Company were to supply them for stocking their depots at Calcutta, Bombay and Delhi. Moolji Sicka & Company were not satisfied with this and said that the Canteen Stores must either return or pay for all stocks supplied, within three months from the date of supply. The Canteen Stores replied on 19th July, 1951, as follows:
They also said, "We now await your cheque for Rs. 7,500. Moolji Sicka & Company replied on 26th July, 1951, and commenced by saying-
They conclude by saying that they hope Moolji Sicka & Company will agree to the six months.
conversion he continued to be a Mahar and so his nomination form was wrongly rejected. That affects the whole election. The other points argued before the Election Tribunal were not pressed before us. We therefore uphold the decision of the Tribunal and dismiss the appeal with costs.
Appeal dismissed.
Agent for the appellant: I. N. Shroff.
Agent for the respondent: Ganpat Rai.	Conclusion
CIVIL APPEALATE, JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No.155 of 1953. Appeal by special leave from the Judgment and Order dated the 15th July, 1953, of the Election Tribunal, Nagpur, in Election Petition No. 3 of 1952.B. Sen and T. P. Naik for the appellant.
Veda Vyas (S. K. Kapur with him) for respondent No. 1. 1954. February 15. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Bose J.-This is an appeal against a decision of the Nagpur Election "Trbunal. The contest before the tribunal was about two seats in the Bhandara Parliamentary Constituency. The elections were held on five days 'in December, 1951, and January, 1952.
Thirteen candidates filed nomination papers, among them the petitioner. Of these, six contested the seat reserved for the Scheduled Castes. -One of these was Gangaram Thaware who has since died.
The Scheduled Caste in question is the Mahar caste. Objection was taken to Thaware's nomination for the reserved seat on the ground that he was not a Mahar. It is admitted that he was born a Mahar, but later in life he joined the Mabanubhava Panth. This, according to the appellant, is a sect which does not believe in caste, and alternatively that it forms a separate caste in itself The contention was that when Gangaram Thaware joined the Panth he ceased to be a member of the Mahar caste' The objection succeeded and his nomination was rejected.
The nomination of another Scheduled Caste candidate was also rejected and five others were withdrawn before the election, among them was the present petitioner. That left six candidates of whom three were eligible for the reserved seat.
The two who were elected were Tularam Sakhare, for the Scheduled Caste seat, and chaturbhuj, Jasani, nor the general seat. Jasani's election was challenged on the ground that he was subject to the disqualifications set out in section 7 (d) of the Representation of the People Act (Act XLIII of 1951) as he was interested in a contract for the supply of goods to the Central Government.

Panth. It also held that Chaturbhuj Jasani had a contract with the Central Government, so he was disqualified. Accordingly it set aside the whole election.
We will deal with Chaturbhuj Jasani's election first. Section 7(d) is in these terms :
Chaturbhuj Jasani was, and still is, a partner in the firm of Moolji Sicka & Company, and it is said that at all material times the firm had- a contract for the supply of bidis to the Government for the troops.
Moolji Sicka & Company is a firm of bidi manufacturers. The Central Government was interested in stocking and purchasing bidis for sale to its troops through its canteens. Accordingly, it placed two of the brands of bidis manufactured by this firm on its approved list and entered into an arrangement with the firm under which the firm was to sell, and the Government was to buy from the firm, from time to time, these two brands of bidis.

It also shows that orders were placed and accepted for goods priced at Rs. 84,659-14-3 before 15th November, 1951, and that payment was not made till after that date. Therefore, on 15th November, 1951, goods worth Rs. 84,659-14-3 had still to be paid for.
Then between 15th November, 1951, and 14th. February, 1952, further orders for goods valued at Rs. 39,695-8-9 were placed And accepted and they were not paid for till after 14th February, 1952.
It was argued that there is nothing to show that. the goods were, not supplied before 15th November, 1951, and before 14th February, 1952. It was said on behalf of 'the appellant that these are the only dates which are crucial, so if Moolji Sicka.& Company hid. fully executed their part of the contracts before the two crucial dates the disqualification would not apply. That raises these questions: (1) Does a person who has fully executed his part of a contract continue to have an interest in it till the goods are paid for ?; and (2) were these contracts fully executed so far as Moolji Sicka & Company's part was concerned? The parties are not agreed about this, so it will now be necessary to examine their letters in detail to determine the terms of the various contracts. The correspondence discloses that the Canteen Stores and Moolji Sicka & Company dealt with each other from time to time under various arrangements which they called " systems. The earliest letter we have about the transactions between these parties is one dated 30th March, 1951. It shows that the "system" which they called the " Direct Supply System "
In view of this, two representatives of Moolji Sicka & Company, met the Chairman of the Board of Administration, who was in charge of the Canteen Stores Department, on 10th July, 1951. They reached certain tentative conclusions which were reduced to writing by the Canteen Stores on 11th July, 1951. Their letter of that date shows that the Canteen Stores proposed to abolish the Direct Supply System in the near future but so far as Moolji Sicka & Company were. concerned they said that the system could be abolished. at once (" forthwith " is the word used) provided Moolji Sicka & Company would agree to supply bidis for the Bombay, Calcutta and Delhi Depots of the Canteen Stores under a new system which they called the " Consignment System ". Under this the Canteen Stores were to pay as they sold. But the new system was intended only for the Bombay, Calcutta and Delhi Depots of the Canteen Stores. The letter goes on to say that for the Pathankot and Srinagar Depots the supplies would have to be made on the " Outright Purchase Basis ". These proposals were embodied under the heading " Future Business RelationsThen there was a provision for what was called theTransition Period ". That said that Untilstocks could be placed in our depots, it was agreed that you would supply your bidis direct against our orders and on such supplies you would allow us rebate as at present.
These proposals were sent to Moolji Sicka & Company for confirmation.
It will be seen that the' letter makes four proposals:
Consignment System ";
(3)That the Pathankot and Srinagar Depots were to be supplied under another new system called the Outright Purchase System ";
(4)That during the "transition period" the "Direct Supply System" was to continue in operation " as at present " even with Moolji Sicka and Company.
Moolji Sicka & Company replied on 16th July, 1951, saying that they were prepared to accept these terms provided the Canteen Stores confirmed certain modificatioins which Moolji Sicka & Company proposed. They were as follows:
(3) They said-
The Rs. 7,500 was what the Canteen Stores claimed from Moolji Sicka & Company as compensation for breach of the agreement under which Moolji Sicka & Company had agreed not to sell to the Canteen Contractors without paying the Canteen Stores a commission. Neither side was able to produce exact figures but this was the estimate made by the Canteen Stores of the loss suffered by them by reason of that breach.
It will be seen that the proposal about the " Consignment System " which the Canteen Stores made was that they would pay Moolji Sicka & Company only when they sold the stocks with which Moolji Sicka & Company were to supply them for stocking their depots at Calcutta, Bombay and Delhi. Moolji Sicka & Company were not satisfied with this and said that the Canteen Stores must either return or pay for all stocks supplied, within three months from the date of supply. The Canteen Stores replied on 19th July, 1951, as follows:
The letter concludes-
They also said, "We now await your cheque for Rs. 7,500. Moolji Sicka & Company replied on 26th July, 1951, and commenced by saying-
Regarding the guarantee they said they could not agree to six months but would agree to three provided the guarantee was limited to goods found to be defective because of faults in manufacture. They concluded-
They conclude by saying that they hope Moolji Sicka & Company will agree to the six months.
Now it will be seen that all this correspondence related to the proposals about the " Consignment System " which were first mooted on 11th July, 1951. Moolji Sicka & Company complained on 24th April, 1951, that the Canteen Stores were not keeping large enough stocks of their bidis and they asked the Canteen Stores to stop the Direct Supply System and purchase stocks direct. The Canteen Stores were naturally reluctant to keep large stocks on hand because bidis 'deteriorate and become unsaleable in course of time. Therefore they proposed the " pay as we sell " system, that is, they would keep stocks of bidis and pay for whatever they sold. But the problem of unsold stocks deteriorating still remained. Who was to be responsible? The obvious answer was that the manufacturers should take back the unsold stocks before they were too far gone and in their place send fresh consignments for sale on the " pay as we sell " basis. We say "obvious" because the manufacturers could use the stale tobacco by re-curing and blending it, or could use it for other purposes provided it was not too far gone. The proposal therefore was that the, Canteen Stores were to keep stocks of Moolji Sicka & Company's bidis in their depots and canteens, pay for what they sold and return all unsold stocks within six months. Moolji Sicka & Company were then to replace them with fresh stocks which would be paid for when sold. This was agreed to in the main but the point at which they were at issue was the six months. Mooli Sicka & -Company proposed three months while the Canteen Stores wanted six months. We think 'the argument used in the letter of 31st July, 1951, that " the result will be obvious. Your sales will be lower " can only have reference to an arrangement of this kind, otherwise no question of the sales being lower could arise. In the case of an outright sale, the sale would be complete when the order was executed, and except for bidis found to be defective due to manufacture Moolji Sicka & Company would have no further concern with them. The sentences the goods may be taken back by you and replaced and " should we find them not moving " can only refer to these proposals about the "Consignment System " In any case, it certainly includes this system.
Moolji Sicka & Company's reply is dated 9th August, 1951. They say-
in Cox v. Truscott(1) is nearer the language of our Act. He hesitatingly proceeded on the debtor and creditor basis. We need not go further than this because, as we have said, if these decisions cannot be distinguished, then we must with respect differ. We hold therefore that these contracts which Moolji Sicka & Company had entered into with the Government subsisted on 15th November, 1951, and on 14th February, 1952, and that as Chatturbhuj Jasani, the appellant, was a partner in the firm he also had both a share and an interest in them on the crucial dates. That brings us to article 299 (1) of the Constitution. It states:-
The contention was that as these contracts were not expressed to be made by the President they are void. Cages were cited tons under the Government of India Acts of 1919 and 1935. Certain sections in these Acts were said to be similar to article 299. We do not think that they are, but in any case the rulings ,under section 30 (2) of the Government of India Act, 1915, as amended by the Government of India Act of 1919 disclose a difference of opinion. Thus, Krihsnaji Nilkant v. Secrtary of State(2) ruled that contracts with the Secretary of State must be by a deed executed on behalf of the Secretary of State for India and in his name. They cannot be made by correspondence or orally. Secretary of State v. Bhagwandas(3) and Devi Prasad Sri Krihhna Prasad Ltd. v. Secretary of State(1) held they could be made by correspondence. Secretary of State V. O.T. Sarin & Company(1) took an intermediate vie,* and held that though contracts in the prescribed form could not be enforced by either side, (1) 21 T.L.R. 319. (4) A.I.R. 1941 All. 377. (2) A.I.R. 1937 Bom. 449,451. (5) I.L.R. 11 Lah. 375. (3) A.I.R. 1938 Bom. 168.
a claim for compensation under section 70 of the Indian Contract Act would lie. Province of Bengal v. S. L. Puri(1) took a strict view and held that even letters headed "Government of India" did not comply with, the rule in section 175 (3) of the Government of India Act, 1935. The Federal Court was called upon to construe section 40 (1) of the Ninth Schedule of the Government of India Act, 1935. It held that the directions in it were only directory and not mandatory, and the same view was taken of article 166 (1) of the present Constitution by this court in Dattatreya Moreshwar Pangarkar v. State of Bombay(2). None of these provisions is quite the same as article 299. For example, -in article 166, as also in section 40(1) of the Government of India Act of 1935, there is a clause which says that "orders" and "instruments" and "other proceedings"
In the present case, there can be no doubt that the Chairman of the Board of Administration acted on behalf of the Union Government and his authority to contract in that capacity was not questioned. There can equally be no doubt that both sides acted in the belief and on the assumption, which was also the fact, that the goods were intended for Government purposes, namely, amenities for the troops. The only flaw is that the contracts were not in proper form and so, because of this purely technical defect, the principal could not have been sued. But that is just the kind of case that section 230(3) of the Indian Contract Act is designed to meet. It would, in our opinion, be disastrous,to hold that the hundreds of Government officers who have daily to enter into a variety of contracts, often of a petty nature, and sometimes in an emergency, cannot contract orally or through correspondence and that every petty contract must be effect- ed by a ponderous legal document couched in a particular form. it may be that Government will not be bound by the contract in that case, but that -is a very different thing from saying that the contracts as such are void and of no effect. It only means "that the principal cannot be sued-; but we take it there would be nothing to prevent ratification, especially if that was for the benefit of Government. There is authority for the view that when a Government officer acts in excess of authority Government is bound if it ratifies the excess: see The Collector of Masulipatam v. Cavaly Venkata Narrainapah(1). We accordingly hold that the contracts in question here are not void simply because the Union Government could not have been,sued on them by reason of article 299(1).
Now section 7(d) of the Representation of the People Act does not require that the contracts at which it strikes should be enforceable against the Government; all it requires. is that the contracts should be for the supply of goods to the Government. The contracts in question are just that and so are hit by the section.
The purpose of the Act is to maintain the purity of the legislatures and to avoid a conflict between duty and interest. It is obvious that the temptation to place interest before duty is just as great when there is likely to be some difficulty in recovering the money from Government (for example, if Government were to choose not to ratify the contracts) as when there is none. In our opinion, the Election Tribunal was-right in disqualifying Chatturbhuj Jasani.
We now turn to Gangaram Thaware. He stood as a Scheduled Caste candidate and his nomination was rejected on the ground that he did not belong to the Scheduled Caste in question, namely the Mahars.
The only question here is whether he ceased to be a Mahar when he joined the Mahanubhava Panth. This gave rise to much controversy and we have been presented with many conflicting opinions. Thus, the Imperial Gazetteer of India, Voluime XXI, page 3012 states that the founder of the sect repudiated the caste system as also a multiplicity of God7f3 and insisted on the monotheistic principle. At the same time it ,says that he taught his disciples to eat with none but (1) 8 M.I.A. 529 at 554.
the initiated and to break off all former ties of caste and religion. Russell in Volume IV of his Tribes and Castes of the Central Provinces says that the Manbhaos (Mahanubhau) is a religious sect,or order which has " now" (1911) become a caste. The Central Provinces Ethnographic Survey, Volume IX, says the same thing at page 107 and at page 110 and adds that members of the sect often act as priests or gurus to the Mahars.
As against this, the Election Tribunal has quoted a number of opinions which tend the other way. Thus, V. B. Kolte says at page 247 of his Shri Chandradhar Charitra that no serious attempt has been made by them to abolish caste, and Ketkar says at page 76, Volume XVIII of the 1926 edition of his Maharashtriya Dhnyankosh that there are two divisions among the Mahanubhavas, one of Sanyasig who renounce the world and the other a secular one. The latter observe the caste system and follow the rituals of their own caste and carry on social contacts with their caste people and marry among them. Similar views are expressed by Bal Krishna Mohanubhav Shastri. But we are not really concerned 'with their theology. What we have to determine are the social and political consequences of such conversions and that, we feel, must be decided in a common sense practical way rather than on theoretical and theocratic grounds. Conversion brings many complexities in its train, for it imports a complex composite composed of 'many ingredients. Religious beliefs, spiritual experience and emotion and intellectual conviction mingle with more material considerations such as severance of family and social ties and the casting off or retention of old customs and observances. The exact proportions of the mixture vary from person to person. At one extreme there is bigoted fanaticism bitterly hostile towards the old order and at the other an easy going laxness and tolerance which makes the conversion only nominal. There is no clear out dividing line and it is not a matter which can be viewed from only one angle.
Looked at from the secular point of view, there are three factors which have to be considered: (1) the reactions of the old body, (2) the intentions of the individual himself and (3) the rules of the new order. If the old order is tolerant of the new faith and sees no reason to outcaste or ex-communicate the convert and the individual himself desires and intends to retain his old social and political ties, the conversion is only nominal for all practical purposes and when we have to consider the legal and political rights of the old body the views of the new faith hardly matter. The new body is free to ostracise and outcaste the convert from its fold if he does not adhere to its tenets, but it can hardly claim the right to interfere in matters, which concern the political rights of the old body when neither the dld body nor the convert is seeking either legal or political favours from the new as opposed to purely spiritual advantage. On the other hand, if the convert has shown by his conduct and dealings that his break from the old order is so complete and final that he no longer regards himself as a member of the old body and there is no reconversion and readmittance to the old fold, it would be wrong to hold that he can nevertheless claim temporal privileges and political advantages which are special to the old order.
In our opinion, broadly speaking, the principles laid down by the Privy Council in the case of a Hindu convert to Christianity apply here: not, of course, the details of the decision but the broad underlying principle. In Abraham v. Abraham(1), their Lordships say:-
The only modification here is that it is not only his choice which must be taken into account but also the views of the body whose religious tenets he has (1) 9 M.I.A. 199 at 242, 243, and 244.
renounced, because here the right we are considering is the right of the old body, the right conferred on it as a special privilege to send a member of its own fold to Parliament. But with that modification the observations which follow. apply in their broad outline.
Now what are the facts here ? Whatever the views of the founder of this sect may have been about caste, it is evident that there has been no rigid adherence to them among his followers in later years. They have either changed their views or have not been able to keep a tight enough control over converts who join them and yet choose to retain their old caste customs and ties. We need not determine whether the Mahanubhava tenets encourage a repudiation of caste only as a desirable ideal or make it a fundamental of the faith because it is evident that present-day Mahanubhavas admit to their fold persons who elect to retain their old caste customs. That makes it easy for the old caste to regard the converts as one of themselves despite the conversion which for all practical purposes is only ideological and involves no change of status.
Now no witness has spoken of any outcasting, neither outcasting in general nor in this special case. No single instance has been produced in which any person who has joined this sect from the Mahar community has ever been outcasted from the Mahars for that reason; and as the sect is said to be over 1000 years old, therehas been time enough for such instances to accumulate. Further, no instance has been produced of a Mahanubhava marrying outside his or her old caste whereas there are instances of Mahanubhavas who have married non-Mahanubhavas belonging to their own caste. Nene (P. W. 1), Sadasheo (P. W. 3), Sitaram (P. W. 4) and Haridas (P. W. 5) say that a Mahar 'convert does not lose his caste on conversion. He is admitted to all caste functions and can marry in the community. Of these, Sadasheo (P. W. 3) and Haridas (P. W. 5) are Mahars. There is no evidence to rebut this. The witnesses on the other side take refuge in theory and, when confronted with actual facts, evade the issue by saying that Mahanubhavas who do these things are not real Mahanubhavas. Harendra (R. W. 1) is a Mahanubhava Guru and so ought to know, but he affects an otherworldly indifference-to mundane affairs and says that as he does not lead a worldly life he does not know whether converts retain their caste distinctions and whether there are inter-dinings and inter-marriages in the Mahanubhava fold itself among those who belonged to different castes before conversion.
Shankar (R. W. 2) says that a convert loses his caste on conversion but gives no instance of ostracism from the old fold. In any case, his evidence is confined to the sanyasi order among the Mahanubhavas because he says that every person who becomes a convert to this sect must renounce the world and cannot marry. When pinned down in cross-exami- nation he had to admit that he did know two or three Mahanubhavas who were leading a worldly life but he meets that by saying that they are not real Mahanubhavas. Chudaman (R. W. 3) evades the issue in the same way. He is a Mahanubhava Pujari and so is another person who ought to have special knowledge. Despite that he says he cannot give a single instance of a person belonging to one caste, initiated into the Mahanubhava sect, marrying a person of another caste initiated into the same Panth. When further pressed he said the question did not arise as a man lost his caste on conversion. On this evidence, and after considering the historical material placed before us, we conclude that conversion to this sect imports little beyond an intellectual acceptance of certain ideological tenets and does not alter the convert's caste status, at any rate,, so far as the householder section of the Panth is concerned. So much for the caste consciousness on both sides. Now considering Gangaram Thaware the individual we find that he was twice married and on both occasions to Mahar girls who were not Mahanubhavas at the time of their respective marriages. His first wife was never converted. His second wife was converted after her marriage. The witnesses say' he was still regarded as a Mahar after his conversion and always looked upon himself as a Mahar and identified himself with the caste. No one on the other side denies this. As we have shown, they took shelter behind generalities and evaded the issue by saying that in that case he cannot be a real Mahanubhava. If he was not, then he must have continued a Mahar even on their view.
The evidence also discloses that Gangaram Thaware led Mahar agitations and processions as a member and leader of the Mahar caste. In 1936 he contested the election for the Provincial Assembly as a Mahar candidate. No one appears to have questioned his competency. And lastly, he declared himself to be a Mahar in the verification to his nomination form in the present election as also in an affidavit filed before the Returning Officer who rejected his nomination. The 'Returning Officer described that as a "cleverly, worded document. " We have read it and find nothing tricky or crooked in it., Therefore, applying the test in Abraham v. Abraham(1), we hold that despite his (1) 9 M.I.A. 199. 199.
conversion he continued to be a Mahar and so his nomination form was wrongly rejected. That affects the whole election. The other points argued before the Election Tribunal were not pressed before us. We therefore uphold the decision of the Tribunal and dismiss the appeal with costs.
Appeal dismissed.
