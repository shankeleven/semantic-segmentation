CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 195 of 1955. Appeal from the judgment and order dated the 30th day of December 1953 of the Nagpur High Court in Miscellaneous Civil Case No. 35 of 1952.
and (3) that the business must be carried on by all or any of those persons acting for all. According to this definition "persons" who have entered into partnership with one another are collectively called a "firm" and the name under which their business is carried on is called the "firm name". The first question that arises is as to whether a firm as such can enter into an agreement with another firm or individual. The answer to the question would depend on whether a firm can be called a "person".	Issue
The learned Advocate for the appellant then urges that at any rate the partnership was not illegal, for there was no legal impediment in the way of all the members of all the three constituent firms and the karta of the Hindu undivided family and the individual entering into an agreement and that, therefore, a valid partnership was constituted by the deed of partnership under consideration. Assuming that this contention is possible in view of the language which (1) [1954] S.C.R. 171; 1953 I.T.R. 405.	PetArg

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS C.J.-This is an appeal from the judgment and order passed by a Bench of the Nagpur High Court on the 30th December, 1953 in Miscellaneous Civil Case No. 35 of 1952, whereby the Bench answered in the negative the question that had been referred to them by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Bombay under section 66(1) of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1922 (hereinafter referred to as the Act). In connection with the assessment for the assessment year 1949/1950 of Dulichand Laxminarayan, an unregistered firm, an application was made under section 26-A of the Act before the Income Tax Officer, Raigarh for its registration as a firm constituted under a Deed of Partnership dated the 17th February 1947. In the opening paragraph of that deed the names and descriptions of the parties thereto were set out in the following words:--
the High Court answered the referred question in the negative. In view, however, of the importance of the question involved in the reference the High Court, under section 66-A(2) of the Act, gave a certificate of fitness for appeal to this Court. Hence the present appeal. Section 26-A of the Act under which the application for registration was made provides as follows:-

This section clearly requires the presence of three elements, namely (1) that there must be an agreement entered into by two or more persons; (2) that the agreement must be to share the profits of a business;
As pointed out in Lindley on Partnership, llth Edition, at page 153, merchants and lawyers have different notions respecting the nature of a firm. Commercial men and accountants are apt to look upon a firm in the light in which lawyers look upon a corporation, i.e., as a body distinct from the members composing it. In other words merchants are used to regard a firm, for purposes of business, as having a separate and independent existence apart from its partners. In some systems of law this separate per-
view finds support from and is implicit in the observations made by this Court in the Commissioner of Income-Tax, West Bengal v. A. W. Figgies & Co. and others(1).	Precedent
The relevant portion of rule 2 of the Rules made under section 59 of 'the Act runs thus: -
There is no definition of the word "person" in the Partnership Act. The General Clauses Act, 1897, however, by section 3 (42) provides that "person shall include any company or association or body of individuals whether incorporated or not". The firm is not a company but is certainly an association or body of individuals. The argument is that applying that definition to the word "persons" occurring in section 4, one can at once say that an unincorporated association or body of persons, like a firm, can enter into a partnership just as by the application of that definition to section 4 of the Indian Partnership Act a company can become a partner in a firm. The definitions given in section 3 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, however, apply when there is nothing repugnant in the subject or context. It is difficult to say that there is anything repugnant in the context of section 4 itself which will exclude the application of that definition to the word "Persons" occurring in section 4. Is there, however, anything repugnant in the subject of partnership law, which will exclude the application of that definition to section 4?
sonality of a firm apart from its members has received full and formal recognition, as, for instance, in Scotland. That is, however, not the English Common Law conception of a firm. English Lawyers do not recognize a firm as an entity, distinct from the members composing it. Our partnership law is based on English Law and we have also adopted the notions of English lawyers as regards a partnership firm. Some of the mercantile usages relating to a firm have, however, found their way into the law of partnership. Thus in keeping accounts, merchants habitually show a firm as a debtor to each partner for what he brings into the common stock and each partner is shown as a debtor to the firm for all that he takes out of that stock. But under the English Common Law, a firm, not being a legal entity, could not sue or be sued in the firm name or sue or be sued by its own partner, for one cannot sue oneself. Later on this rigid law of procedure, however, gave way to considerations of commercial convenience and permitted a firm to sue or be sued in the firm name, as if it were a corporate body (see Code of Civil Procedure, Order XXX corresponding to rules of the English Supreme Court Order XLVIII-A). The law of procedure has gone to the length of allowing a firm to sue or be sued by another firm having some common partners or even to sue or be sued by one or more of its own partners (see Order XXX, rule 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure), as if the firm is an entity distinct from its partners. Again in taking partnership accounts and in administering partnership assets, the law has, to some extent, adopted the mercantile view and the liabilities of the firm are regarded as the liabilities of the partners only in case they cannot be met and discharged by the firm out of its assets. The creditors of the firm are, in the first place, paid out of the partnership assets and if there is any surplus then the share of each partner in such surplus is applied in payment of his separate debts, if any, or paid to him. Conversely, separate property of a partner is applied first in the payment of his separate debts and the surplus, if any is utilised in meeting the debts of the firm (see section 49 of the Indian Partnership Act, 1932). In the Indian Income Tax Act itself a firm is, by section 3, which is the charging section, made a unit of assessment.
It is clear from the foregoing discussion that the law, English as well as Indian, has, for some specific purposes, some of which are referred to above, relaxed its rigid notions and extended a limited per,personality of a firm. Nvertheless, the general concept of partnership, firmly established in both systems of Law, still is that a firm is not an entity or "person" in law but is merely an association of individuals and a firm name is only a collective name of those individuals who constitute the firm. In other words, a firm name is merely an expression, only a compendious mode of designating the persons who have agreed to carry on business in partnership. According to the -principles of English jurisprudence, which we have adopted for the purposes of determining legal rights "there is no such thing as a firm known to the law" as was said by James, L. J. in Ex parte Corbett, In re Shand(1) In these circumstances to import the definition of the word "person" occurring in section 3(42) of the General Clauses Act, 1897 into section 4 of the Indian Partnership Act will, according to lawyers, English or Indian,, be totally repugnant to the subject of partnership law as they know and understand it to be. It is in this view of the matter that it has been consistently held in this country that a firm as such is not entitled to enter into partnership with another firm or individuals. It is not necessary to refer in detail to those decisions many of which will be found cited in Jabalpur Ice Manufacturing Association v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Madhya Pradesh(2) to which a reference has already been made. We need only refer to the case of Bhagwanji Morarji Goculdas v. Alembic Chemical Works Co. Ltd and others(3), where it has been laid down by the Privy Council that Indian Law has not given legal personality to a firm apart from the partners. This (1) [1880] L.R. 14 Ch. 122, 126. (2) [1955] 27 I.T.R. 88.
In Jai Dayal Madan Gopal(2), Sulaiman C. J. followed the Calcutta decisions and was not prepared to dissent from the view that the word "person" in section 239 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 should not be interpreted so as to include a firm. The learned Chief Justice, however, expressed the view that it was difficult to say that there was anything in section 239 itself which made the application to that section of the definition of "person" as given in General Clauses Act in any way repugnant. The learned Chief Justice, however, does not appear to have con- sidered whether there was anything repugnant in the subject of partnership law, as it prevails in this country, which operates to exclude the application of that deanition to the word "person" occurring in section 239 of the Indian Contract Act. In our opinion, the word "Persons" in section 4 of the Indian Partnership Act, which has replaced section 239 of the Indian Contract Act, contemplates only natural or artificial, i.e., legal persons and for the reasons stated above, a firm is not a "person" and as such is not entitled to enter into a partnership with another firm or Hindu undivided family or individual. In this view of the matter there can arise no question of registration of a partnership purporting to be one between three firms, a Hindu undivided family business and an individual as a firm under section 26-A of the Act.

has been used in this deed for describing the parties, the position of the appellant will not improve, for in order to be entitled to the benefit of registration under the Act, it will have to be shown that the shares of all individual partners are specified in the deed and that all the partners have personally signed the application for registration as required by section 26-A of the Act read with Rule 2. The deed specifies that each of the five constituent parties is entitled to an equal, i.e., 1/5 share but it does not specify the individual shares of each of the partners of each of the three smaller constituent firms. Further all the members of those three firms have not signed the application for registration personally. It is said that each of the three persons who executed the deed for the three smaller firms must be regarded as having the authority of their co-partners in their respective firms to sign the application for registration just as they had their authority to execute the deed itself for them. Even if they had such authority-as to which there is no evidence at all on the record-the section and rule 2 require that each partner (not being minors) must sign personally. That admittedly has not been done, and., therefore, the application was not in proper form. In our judgment the answer given by the High Court to the question is correct. This appeal must, therefore, be dismissed with costs.	Conclusion

the High Court answered the referred question in the negative. In view, however, of the importance of the question involved in the reference the High Court, under section 66-A(2) of the Act, gave a certificate of fitness for appeal to this Court.

and "firm name" in the words following:-
Persons who have entered into partnership with one another are called individually "partners" and collectively "a firm", and the name under which their business is carried on is called the "firm name".
This section clearly requires the presence of three elements, namely (1) that there must be an agreement entered into by two or more persons; (2) that the agreement must be to share the profits of a business;
and (3) that the business must be carried on by all or any of those persons acting for all. According to this definition "persons" who have entered into partnership with one another are collectively called a "firm" and the name under which their business is carried on is called the "firm name". The first question that arises is as to whether a firm as such can enter into an agreement with another firm or individual. The answer to the question would depend on whether a firm can be called a "person".
There is no definition of the word "person" in the Partnership Act. The General Clauses Act, 1897, however, by section 3 (42) provides that "person shall include any company or association or body of individuals whether incorporated or not". The firm is not a company but is certainly an association or body of individuals. The argument is that applying that definition to the word "persons" occurring in section 4, one can at once say that an unincorporated association or body of persons, like a firm, can enter into a partnership just as by the application of that definition to section 4 of the Indian Partnership Act a company can become a partner in a firm. The definitions given in section 3 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, however, apply when there is nothing repugnant in the subject or context. It is difficult to say that there is anything repugnant in the context of section 4 itself which will exclude the application of that definition to the word "Persons" occurring in section 4. Is there, however, anything repugnant in the subject of partnership law, which will exclude the application of that definition to section 4?
