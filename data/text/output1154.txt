A. N. Lakshmana Shenoy vs The Income Tax Officer, Ernakulam ... on 28 April, 1958	Case Title
CIVIL APPELLATE, JURISDICTION: Civil Appeals Nos. 143 to 145 of 1954, 27 to 30 and 161 to 164 of 1956.
R. Ganapathy Iyer and R. H. Dhebar, for the respondent in C. As. Nos. 143-145 of 1954.
A. V. Viswanatha Sastri and G. Gopalakishnan, for the respondents in C. As. Nos. 27-30 of 1956.
These are eight appeals and the relevant facts are these. Civil Appeals 27 to 30 of 1956 arise out of four writ petitions numbered 52 and 53 of 1953, and 105 and 106 of 1954, which were dealt with together in the Mysore High Court by a common judgment dated December 14, 1954. Civil Appeals 161 to 164 also arise out of four writ petitions (no. 122 of 1954 and nos. 35 to 37 of 1955) filed in the same High Court. The orders passed in those writ petitions were that they were governed by the aforesaid decision dated
In all these cases the petitioners, who are respondents before us, were assessed to income-tax under the Mysore Income-tax Act, 1923 (hereinafter called the Mysore Act) for different years previous to the integration of Mysore with India, and the assessment proceedings were completed and closed under the Mysore Act by demand notices issued by the Income-tax Officers concerned. But subsequent to the integration of Mysore, notices under s. 34 of the Mysore Act were issued against the petitioners, and they challenged the jurisdiction of the Income-tax Officers to issue such notices. Section 34 of the Mysore Act states-	Issue
A. V. Viswanatha Sastri, K. R. Choudhury and G. Gopalakri- shnan, for the respondents in C. As. Nos. 161-164 of 1956. 1958. April 28. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by S.K. DAS J.-This judgment relates to and governs eleven appeals which for convenience have been classified into two groups. The first group may be called the group of Travancore-Cochin appeals, and within this group fall Civil Appeals Nos. 143 to 145 of 1954. The, second group may be called the group of Mysore appeals and within this group are eight appeals, namely, Civil Appeals Nos. 27 to 30 of 1956 and 161 to 164 of 1956. By reason of the circumstance that certain common questions of law and fact arise in all these eleven appeals, they have been heard one after the other; but it will be convenient and will avoid confusion if we state the facts relating to the Travancore-Cochin group first and then deal with the questions arising therefrom. We shall then state the additional facts of the Mysore group of appeals, and answer the questions arising therefrom, in so far only as they have not been answered already in relation to the Travancore-Cochin group. It may be here added that in the Travancore-Cochin appeals (Civil Appeals 143 to 145 of 1954) the appellant is the assessee, A. N. Lakshmana Shenoy, of Messrs. New Guna Shenoy Company, Ernakulam, and the two respondents are the Income-tax Officers of Ernakulam in Cochin and of Kottayam in Travancore. In the other group of appeals, namely, the Mysore appeals, the appellants are the Income-tax Officers of certain income-tax circles in Bangalore and the respondents are assessees who carry on business within the jurisdictional area of the said Income- tax Officers. In the Travancore Cochin appeals, the High Court of Travancore-Cochin came to a decision against the assessee, while in the Mysore appeals the High Court of Mysore came to an opposite conclusion on identical questions of law; that is why in the first group of appeals the assessee is the appellant and in the second group the appellants are the Income-tax Officers.
So far we have traced the constitutional history of the integration of Travancore-Cochin, its accession to the Dominion of India and finally its acceptance of the Constitution of India whereby it became a Part B State within the Constitution of India. We now go back to the story of the assessments made on the assessee. The income of the assessee for the two accounting years, 1122 and 1123 M.E. (corresponding to the years ending on August 16, 1947, and August 16, 1948, respectively) was assessed in the two assessment years, 1123 and 1124 M.E. in accordance with the Cochin Act by the Income-tax Officer at Ernakulam by his orders dated July 28, 1949, and January 31, 1950, respectively. These assessments, the assessee alleged, became final and he paid the taxes accordingly. Similarly, the income of the assessee in Travancore for the accounting years 1122 and 1123 M.E. was assessed under the Travancore Act for the assessment years 1123 and 1124 by the Income-tax Officer, Kottayam, by his orders dated April 11, 1949, and July 30, 1949, and these assessments also, according to the assessee, became final and he paid the taxes accordingly. The income of the assessee for the accounting year 1124 M.E.was assessed under the Indian Incometax Act ' 1922, in the assessment year 1951-52 by the Income-tax Officer, Ernakulam, by his order dated January 21, 1952. The account books of the assessee were rejected as unreliable and the Income-tax Officer, Ernakulam, made a " best of judgment "	Facts

Travancore-Cochin appeals: We proceed now to deal with the Travancore-Cochin appeals. The assessee, A. N. Lakshmana Shenoy, is a hardware merchant who carried on his trade and business for several years in the then States of Travancore and Cochin, with his headquarters at Ernakulam in Cochin. He was assessed to income-tax in both the States under the income-tax law in force there, namely, the Cochin Income-tax Act of 1117 M. E. (hereinafter referred to as the Cochin Act) and the Travancore Income-tax Act of 1121 M. E. (hereinafter referred to as the Travancore Act). He was so assessed by the Incometax Officer at Ernakulam for the Cochin State and the Income-tax Officer at Kottayam for the Travancore State. It is a matter of history that Cochin and Travancore were formerly independent States, and till the lapse of paramountcy, the Crown as represented by and operating through the political authorities provided the nexus between those States and the Central Indian Government. The Indian Independence Act, 1947, released the States from their obligation to the Crown; but in August, 1947, the Rulers of the two States acceded to the Dominion of India. This was followed by a process of two-fold integration-the consolidation of the States into sizeable administrative units and their democratisation. On May 27, 1949, the Rulers entered into a covenant which was concurred in by the Government of India. By that covenant the Rulers agreed that as from the first day of July, 1949, the States of Travancore and Cochin should be united in and form one State with a common executive, legislature and judiciary by the name of the United State of Travancore and Cochin. The covenant further provided that " there shall be a Rajpramukh for the United State and the Ruler of Travancore shall be the first Rajpramukh; the executive authority of the United State shall be exercised by the Rajpramukh and there shall be a council of ministers to aid and advise him ". Article IX of the covenant said that " the Rajpramukh shall within a fortnight of the appointed day execute on behalf of the United State an Instrument of Accession in accordance with the provisions of s. 6 of the Government of India Act, 1935, and in place of the earlier Instruments of Accession of the covenanting States; and he shall by such Instrument, accept as matters with respect to which the Dominion Legislature may make laws for the United State all the matters mentioned in List I and List III of the Seventh Schedule to the said Act, except the entries in List I relating to any tax or duty ". There was a proviso to the Article which said that nothing in the Article shall be deemed to prevent the Rajpramukh from accepting any or all of the entries in the said List I relating to any tax or duty as matters with respect to which the Dominion Legislature may make laws for the United State. On July 14, 1949, a supplementary Instrument was executed by the Rajpramukh by which he accepted, on behalf of the United State, all matters enumerated in List I and List III of the Seventh Schedule to the Government of India Act, 1935, as matters in respect of which the Dominion Legislature might make laws for the United State, subject, however, to "the proviso that nothing contained in the said lists or in any other provision of the Government of India Act, 1935, shall be deemed to empower the Dominion Legislature to impose any tax or duty in the territories of the United State. The result was that in spite of the integration and accession of the United State to the Dominion of India, the Cochin Act continued to be in force in the territory formerly known as Cochin and the Travancore Act in the territory known as Travancore. On November 24, 1949, there was a proclamation by the Rajpramukh which stated that in the best interests of the United State of Travancore and Cochin it was desirable that the constitutional relationship established between the United State and the Dominion of India shall not only be continued, but the relation as between that State and the contemplated Union of India shall be further strengthened ; it was then stated that the Constitution of India as drafted by the Constituent Assembly of India which included duly appointed representatives of the United State provided a suitable basis for strengthening the relation between the two States. The proclamation then went on to say- ''And whereas by virtue of the power vested in it under the Covenant establishing this State, the Legislative Assembly of the State has resolved that the Constitution framed by the Constituent Assembly of India be adopted by this State. I now hereby declare and direct-
As in the High Court so also before us, the only document on which the Income-tax Officers relied for this part of their case is Ext. VIII. This document, according to the Income- tax Officers, furnished the definite information in consequence of which they made the necessary discovery. Learned counsel for the assessee has taken us through Ext. VIII, Ext. A (statement of the case submitted by the assessee to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner) and the order of the Appellate Commissioner, dated December 14, 1953, and he has contended that (1) Ext. VIII does not relate to the years in question and cannot, therefore, constitute definite information for those years; (2) it gives certain highly speculative grounds for discrediting the account books of the assessee, which grounds have not been accepted by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner; and (3) in any view, it contained no information on which the Income-tax Officers could be said to have made any discovery. As to (1) above, the High Court rightly pointed out that Ext. VIII contained information of a kind which disclosed a definite and systematic pattern of transactions for avoidance of tax not only in respect of the year covered by the order but spread over years anterior to it. Secondly, Ext. VIII disclosed, according to the Income-tax Officers concerned, a systematic suppression of cash Bales., a regular trade in purchase and sale of controlled commodities at profiteering rates, passing bogus bills for purchases, understating stocks, segregating stocks for clandestine sales, and selling goods to the branches at artificial book losses. There can be no doubt that all this information, if honestly believed, would reasonably support the opinion of the Income-tax Officers that there is a discovery of " escaped " income etc., within the meaning of s. 44 of the Cochin Act and s. 47 of the Travancore Act. But learned counsel for the assessee argues that while it may be right to say that Ext. VIII prima facie contains the kind of information which will satisfy the conditions of s. 44 of the Cochin Act and s. 47 of the Travancore Act, we must take note of the fact that according to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, as shown by his order dated December 14, 1953, the so-called information contained in Ext. VIII was really non-existent, and the information being non- existent, there was no foundation for the action taken by the Income-tax Officers. We are unable to accept this argument as correct. Apart from the consideration that the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner was not available when the Income-tax Officers issued their notices, we think that the argument overstates the effect of the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner. It is true that the Appellate Assistant Commissioner considered in detail the various criticisms of the Income-tax Officer with regard to the account books along with the explanations offered on behalf of the assessee; but he expressed his final conclusion in the following words:	PetArg
limited by those sections. In the present case the liability of the respondents both for income-tax and for super-tax wag determined by the Income-tax Officer on January 17, 1927. In the order made by him on that date he assessed the respondents to income-tax at the maximum rate, but as the respondents were at that time a registered firm he held, as he was bound to hold, that no super-tax was to be levied. On some date before the end of March, 1927, he served on the respondents a notice of demand for the tax that he had determined was properly leviable. The assess- ment having been made under s. 23, sub-s. (4), no appeal lay in respect of it. The assessment of the respondents was therefore final both in respect of income-tax and super-tax. Their liability in respect of both taxes had been finally determined, and none the less because the question of their liability to supertax had been determined in their favour. It was, indeed, contended before their Lordships that the assessment could not be regarded as having been determined inasmuch as the Commissioner might at any time, and apparently after any lapse of time, however long, cancel the registration of the respondents as a registered firm and so subject the respondents to liability to pay super-tax. Their Lordships would, in any case, hesitate long before acceding to a contention that would lead to so extravagant results. In their opinion, however, the contention cannot prevail. The Commissioner's powers under s. 33 can only be exercised subject to the provisions of the Act, of which the provisions in ss. 34 and 35 are in this respect of the greatest importance."	RespArg
Appeals from the judgment and order dated September 14, 1953, of the former Travancore-Cochin High Court in Original Petitions Nos. 53, 56 and 57 of 1952. Appeals from the judgment and order dated December 14, 1954, of the Mysore High Court in C. P. Nos.
That the Constitution of India shortly to be adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India shall be the Constitution for the United State of Travancore and Cochin as for the other parts of India and shall be enforced as such in accordance with the tenor of its provisions.
That the provisions of the said Constitution shall as from the date of its commencement, supersede and abrogate all other constitutional provisions inconsistent therewith which are at present in force in this State."
and, when an agreement is so entered into, the provisions of this Chapter shall in relation to such State have effect subject to the terms of such agreement." The argument on behalf of the assessee is that the recommendations of the Indian States Finances Enquiry Committee which were accepted by the Rajpramukh of Travancore-Cochin in the agreement entered into by the Rajpramukh with the President of India on February 25, 1950, were designed to secure " legal continuity of pending proceedings " and " finality and validity of completed proceedings " under the preexisting State legislation ; therefore, s. 13(1) of the Finance Act, 1950, should be so construed as to be in consonance with the aforesaid agreement, and, in the alternative, if s. 13(1) is construed to be at variance with the aforesaid financial agreement, it should be held to be void by reason of the; provisions; of Arts. 278 and 295 of the Constitution.
It cannot, therefore, be Raid that the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner washed out the entire information contained in Ext. VIII so as to strike at the very root of the jurisdiction of the Income-tax Officers concerned to issue the notices in question. It is to be remembered that there is a distinction between receipt of definite information as a consequence of which a discovery is made and a notice is issued, and the final determination as to the liability or extent of liability for escaped assessment etc. We accept as correct the view expressed in Firm Jitanram Nirmalram v. Commissioner of Income-tax (1), that the phrase " definite information " cannot be construed in a universal sense and its meaning must depend on and vary with the circumstances of each case. There is no doubt, however, that the information must be definite, that is, more than mere guess, gossip or rumour. There must also be a causal connexion between the information and the discovery; but " discovery " in (1) A.I.R. 1952 Pat. 163.
to this decision in support of its view on the construction of s. 13 (1). We are unable to accept these contentions as correct; nor do we think that the decision cited supports the view expressed by the Mysore High Court. The facts in Khemchands case (1) were briefly these. The firm of Khemchand applied to the Incometax Officer to have the firm registered, the consequence of such registration being that the profits of the firm would not be assessable to super- tax. On January 17, 1927, the Income-tax Officer assessed the firm to income-tax for the year 1926-27 under s. 23, sub-s. (4) of the Act; but no super tax was imposed as the firm having applied for registration was registered. Notice of demand for the amount assessed was made in 1927. Subsequently, the Commissioner ordered the cancellation of registration, and directed the Income-tax Officer to take necessary action thereupon. On May 4, 1929, the Income-tax Officer imposed super-tax and issued a notice of demand in May, 1929. The question in the appeal was whether the Income-tax authorities had any jurisdiction to assess Khemchand's firm to super tax for the year 1926-27. Their Lordships pointed out that the powers of the Commissioner tinder s. 33 could only be exercised subject to the provisions of the Act, of which the provisions in ss. 34 and 35 were important. They held that it was debatable whether the circumstances of the case were such as to bring it within s. 34 and so far as s. 35 was concerned, the Income-tax Officer was hopelessly barred by time. In that context, their Lordships said:
These observations lend no support to the view that the word" assessment" must always bear a particular meaning in the Income-tax Act. On the contrary, at p. 247 of the report, their Lordships said:
privilege and escape payment of the full tax leviable under the provisions of the relevant Act. On this point we approve of the decision in Firm L. Hazari Mal v. Income-tax Officer, Ambala (1), where Bhandari C. J., said-
(c)Such State Courts (except Courts of final appeal from orders of the State High Courts) as may in fact correspond to particular grades and classes of "British Indian" Courts (Civil and Criminal) may have to be statutorily " recognised " as " corresponding judicial authorities " for purpose of dealing with cases arising in the States under the " federal " laws of the Union of India; and the Supreme Court in India will have to be made the Court of final appeal from decisions of the State High Courts to the same extent as in the case of Provincial High Courts.
We see no good grounds why full effect should not be given to it; it is one of the limitations, as stated in cl. (a), subject to which the State law is to be repealed. The matter is made still more clear by what is stated in the paragraph that immediately follows, viz. paragraph 10 of the annexure to the report of the Committee. That paragraph states-
In dealing with the Travancore-Cochin appeals, we have fully dealt with the two grounds on which the respondent assessees in the Mysore appeals challenged the jurisdiction of the Income-tax Officers concerned to issue the notices under. s. 34 of The Mysore Act. Two additional points urged in support of ground no. (1) maybe stated here. It has been urged that the proviso to s. 34 of the Mysore Act brings out the distinction between I assessment ' and ' re-assessment '; and secondly, it is contended that the jurisdiction under s. 34 is limited to ascertainment of extra income not assessed and the section does not confer jurisdiction to make a new assessment, for taxing whole of that assessment, under the Act. Learned counsel for the assessees has invited our attention to In re Kashi Nath Bagla (1); Madhavjee Damodar Thackersay and Another v. Commissioner of Income Tax, BOMBAY(2) and Anglo-French Textile Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Madras, No. 4 (3). The real question for decision in these appeals is the true scope and effect of s. 13 (1) of the Finance Act, and on that question the additional points' mentioned (1) A. 1. R. 1932 All. 1.

The Committee submitted a report in due course and made certain recommendations. On the basis of those recommendations certain agreements were entered into between the President of India and the Rajpramukhs, including the Rajpramukh of Travancore-Cochin and the Rajpramukh of Mysore. We shall refer in somewhat greater detail to these agreements, particularly the agreements entered into by the Rajpramukhs of Travancore-Cochin and Mysore. The contention on behalf of the assessee is that these agreements with Part B States with regard to certain financial matters received constitutional sanctity in Art. 278 of the Constitution (now repealed by the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956). Article 278, so far as it is relevant for our purpose, was in these terms " 278 (1). Notwithstanding anything in the Constitution, the Government of India may, subject to the provisions of clause (2), enter into an agreement with the Government of a State specified in Part B of the First Schedule with respect to-
(a)the levy and collection of any tax or duty leviable by the Government of India in such State and for the distribution of the proceeds thereof otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter ;

We proceed now to a consideration in detail of the arguments urged before us on behalf of the assessee in the Travancore- Cochin appeals. In logical sequence the point as to the absence of foundation for the -action taken by the two Income-tax Officers of Ernakulam and Kottayam in the matter of the issue, of" notices. for reassessment, comes first and we propose now to deal with it. It is necessary at this stage to set out the two sections under which the Income-tax Officers proposed to take action against the assessee. The two sections are s. 44 of the Cochin Act and s. 47 of the Travancore Act. Section, 44 of the Cochin Act, so far as it is relevant for our purpose, is in these terms-
Section 47 (1) of the Travancore Act is identical ill terms and need not therefore be, quoted. It is worthy, of note that the terms of the. aforesaid two sections are similar to s. 34 of, the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, as it,.stood after the amending Act of 1939 and, before the amendments of 1948. The two requisites conditions for the application of the section are contained in the first part, and they are: firstly, there must be definite information which has come into possession of the Income-tax Officer and, secondly, in consequence of that information, the Income-fax Officer discovers that,, income, profits or gains chargeable to income-tax have escaped assessment in any year etc. It is only when these two conditions are fulfilled that the Income-tax Officer can take necessary action under s. 44. The question before us is whether these two conditions were fulfilled in the cases out of which the TravancoreCochin appeals have arisen.
the context of the section does not mean a conclusion of certainty at the stage of notice. What is necessary at that stage is that the Income-tax Officer should have formed an honest belief upon materials which reasonably support such belief. This, in our opinion, is the correct view, and judged from that standpoint, Ext. VIII fulfilled the requirements of s. 44 of the Cochin Act and s. 47 of the Travancore Act.
We now turn to the construction of s. 13 (1) of the Finance Act, 1950. The argument on this point has meandered over a wide area; but it is really dependent on the meaning to be given to the expression for the purposes Of the levy, assessment and collection of income-tax and super-tax "
If the word ' assessment ' is taken in its comprehensive sense, as we think it should be taken in the context of s. 13(1) of the Finance Act, 1950, it would include I re- assessment' made under the provisions of the Act. Such 're- assessment' will without doubt come within the expression 'levy, assessment and collection of income-tax'. In his speech in Commissioners For General Purposes of Income-Tax For City of London v. Gibbs and Others (1), Lord Simon has pointed out that the word 'assessment' is used in the English Incometax Code in more than one sense; and sometimes within the bounds of the same section, two separate meanings of the word may be found. One meaning is the fixing of the sum taken to represent the actual profit and the other the actual sum in tax which the taxpayer is liable to pay. It has been contended before us that the Finance Act and the Income-tax Act should be read together as forming one Code, and so read the words I assessment' and I re-assessment 'acquire definite and distinct connotations. We are unable to agree, for the reasons which we have already given, that even if we read the Finance Act along with the Income-tax Act the word ' assessment' can be given a restricted meaning. To repeat those reasons: the income-tax code itself uses the word assessment in different senses, and in the context and collocation of the words of the Finance Act, the word 'assessment' is capable of bearing a comprehensive meaning only. We can find no good. reasons for holding that in the matter of levy, assessment and collection of income- tax, the Finance Act, 1950, contemplated that some persons should enjoy a,, (1)[1942] A.C. 402, 406.
The modifications which follow have no bearing on the question at issue and need not be set out. Now, let us examine the relevant recommendations of the Committee, which are accepted by the Parties and form part of the agreement. These recommendations are summarised in para. 9 of the annexure to Part I of the Committee's report, and are set out below-
really no doubt left in the matter. The Committee did not restrict the limitations they were suggesting, to a proceeding which was actually pending on the date of repeal of the State law; it gave a wider meaning to pending proceedings-that is, "proceedings pending under and arising out of the preexisting State Acts". It is to be remembered that where an assessment starts with a notice under s. 34 of the Indian Income-tax Act (or corresponding section of the Cochin or Travancore Act), all the relevant provisions of that Act apply as effectively as where the assessment starts with a notice under s. 22 (2)-or corresponding section of the Cochin or Travancore Act-in the ordinary course. It is also not disputed that the assessment made under s. 34 in any year subsequent to the relevant assessment year must be made as if it were made in the relevant assessment year, and the assessment must be based on the provisions of the Act as it stood in the year in which the income ought to have been assessed. Having regard to these considerations, we find no difficulty in holding that a re-assessment proceeding under s. 44, Cochin Act, or s. 47, Travancore Act, is a proceeding which comes under cl. (e) of the recommendations of the Committee, and must be disposed of under the preexisting State law. Section 13 (1) of the Finance Act, 1950, gives effect to that recommendation. There is, therefore, nothing in the recommendations which would restrict the meaning of the expression " levy, assessment and collection of income- tax " in s. 13 (1) of the Finance Act; nor do they bring s. 13 (1) into conflict with Arts. 278 and 295 of the Constitution.
It corresponds to s. 34 of the Indian Income-tax Act as it stood prior to the amending Act of 1939 and the general scheme of the Mysore Act was the same as that of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, as it stood before 1939. The two grounds on which the jurisdiction of the Income-tax Officers was challenged were-
(1) Under the Finance Act, 1950, the Mysore Act stood repealed on and from April 1, 1950, and s. 13 (1) of the Finance Act kept alive the Mysore Act for the purpose of levy; assessment and collection of incometax etc. for the period mentioned therein, but did not save s. 34 of the Mysore Act for the purpose of reassessment of income-tax; therefore, the notices issued under s. 34 of the Mysore Act were without jurisdiction and authority.
above throw very little light. There is, indeed, a dis- tinction between an original or normal assessment under s. 23 and a re-assessment under s. 34; but we' have shown that the word " assessment " has been used in more than one sense in Income-tax law, and( so far as s. 13 (1) of the Finance Act, 1950, is concerned, there is no doubt that the expression I levy, assessment and collection of income-tax' has been used in a comprehensive sense so as to include the whole procedure for imposing liability upon the taxpayer. Result :	Section
certain important issues of a legal nature will arise in connection with the actual taking over of " federal "
finality and validity " of completed proceedings under the pre-existing State legislation-, we think the whole body of State legislation relating to " federal " subjects should be repealed and the corresponding body of Central legislation extended proprio vigore to the States, with effect from the prescribed date or as and when the administration of particular " federal " subject is assumed by the Centre.
(b)For the above purpose, as well as for future "federal" administration in States, it may be necessary specifically to extend not merely the legislative, but also the executive and administrative competence of the Centre, its officers and " authorities ", and the judicial authority of its Courts, to the territories of the States.
(d) Those sections of the various Indian Acts and Ordinances which set out their territorial " extent of application " will require amending so as to include State territories with effect from the prescribed date.
(e)It will be necessary to provide that all matters and proceedings pending under, or arising out of, the preexisting State Acts shall be disposed of under those Acts, by so far as may be, the " corresPonding authorities ", (nominated by the Chief Executive Authority) under the corresponding Indian Acts."
We accordingly hold that there is no substance in any of the three points urged on behalf of the assessee in the Travancore-Cochin appeals.

A. V. Viswanatha Sastri, K. R. Choudhury and G. Gopalakri- shnan, for the respondents in C. As. Nos. 161-164 of 1956. 1958. April 28. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by S.K. DAS J.-This judgment relates to and governs eleven appeals which for convenience have been classified into two groups. The first group may be called the group of Travancore-Cochin appeals, and within this group fall Civil Appeals Nos. 143 to 145 of 1954. The, second group may be called the group of Mysore appeals and within this group are eight appeals, namely, Civil Appeals Nos. 27 to 30 of 1956 and 161 to 164 of 1956. By reason of the circumstance that certain common questions of law and fact arise in all these eleven appeals, they have been heard one after the other; but it will be convenient and will avoid confusion if we state the facts relating to the Travancore-Cochin group first and then deal with the questions arising therefrom. We shall then state the additional facts of the Mysore group of appeals, and answer the questions arising therefrom, in so far only as they have not been answered already in relation to the Travancore-Cochin group. It may be here added that in the Travancore-Cochin appeals (Civil Appeals 143 to 145 of 1954) the appellant is the assessee, A. N. Lakshmana Shenoy, of Messrs. New Guna Shenoy Company, Ernakulam, and the two respondents are the Income-tax Officers of Ernakulam in Cochin and of Kottayam in Travancore. In the other group of appeals, namely, the Mysore appeals, the appellants are the Income-tax Officers of certain income-tax circles in Bangalore and the respondents are assessees who carry on business within the jurisdictional area of the said Income- tax Officers. In the Travancore Cochin appeals, the High Court of Travancore-Cochin came to a decision against the assessee, while in the Mysore appeals the High Court of Mysore came to an opposite conclusion on identical questions of law; that is why in the first group of appeals the assessee is the appellant and in the second group the appellants are the Income-tax Officers.
Travancore-Cochin appeals: We proceed now to deal with the Travancore-Cochin appeals. The assessee, A. N. Lakshmana Shenoy, is a hardware merchant who carried on his trade and business for several years in the then States of Travancore and Cochin, with his headquarters at Ernakulam in Cochin. He was assessed to income-tax in both the States under the income-tax law in force there, namely, the Cochin Income-tax Act of 1117 M. E. (hereinafter referred to as the Cochin Act) and the Travancore Income-tax Act of 1121 M. E. (hereinafter referred to as the Travancore Act). He was so assessed by the Incometax Officer at Ernakulam for the Cochin State and the Income-tax Officer at Kottayam for the Travancore State. It is a matter of history that Cochin and Travancore were formerly independent States, and till the lapse of paramountcy, the Crown as represented by and operating through the political authorities provided the nexus between those States and the Central Indian Government. The Indian Independence Act, 1947, released the States from their obligation to the Crown; but in August, 1947, the Rulers of the two States acceded to the Dominion of India. This was followed by a process of two-fold integration-the consolidation of the States into sizeable administrative units and their democratisation. On May 27, 1949, the Rulers entered into a covenant which was concurred in by the Government of India. By that covenant the Rulers agreed that as from the first day of July, 1949, the States of Travancore and Cochin should be united in and form one State with a common executive, legislature and judiciary by the name of the United State of Travancore and Cochin. The covenant further provided that " there shall be a Rajpramukh for the United State and the Ruler of Travancore shall be the first Rajpramukh; the executive authority of the United State shall be exercised by the Rajpramukh and there shall be a council of ministers to aid and advise him ". Article IX of the covenant said that " the Rajpramukh shall within a fortnight of the appointed day execute on behalf of the United State an Instrument of Accession in accordance with the provisions of s. 6 of the Government of India Act, 1935, and in place of the earlier Instruments of Accession of the covenanting States; and he shall by such Instrument, accept as matters with respect to which the Dominion Legislature may make laws for the United State all the matters mentioned in List I and List III of the Seventh Schedule to the said Act, except the entries in List I relating to any tax or duty ". There was a proviso to the Article which said that nothing in the Article shall be deemed to prevent the Rajpramukh from accepting any or all of the entries in the said List I relating to any tax or duty as matters with respect to which the Dominion Legislature may make laws for the United State. On July 14, 1949, a supplementary Instrument was executed by the Rajpramukh by which he accepted, on behalf of the United State, all matters enumerated in List I and List III of the Seventh Schedule to the Government of India Act, 1935, as matters in respect of which the Dominion Legislature might make laws for the United State, subject, however, to "the proviso that nothing contained in the said lists or in any other provision of the Government of India Act, 1935, shall be deemed to empower the Dominion Legislature to impose any tax or duty in the territories of the United State. The result was that in spite of the integration and accession of the United State to the Dominion of India, the Cochin Act continued to be in force in the territory formerly known as Cochin and the Travancore Act in the territory known as Travancore. On November 24, 1949, there was a proclamation by the Rajpramukh which stated that in the best interests of the United State of Travancore and Cochin it was desirable that the constitutional relationship established between the United State and the Dominion of India shall not only be continued, but the relation as between that State and the contemplated Union of India shall be further strengthened ; it was then stated that the Constitution of India as drafted by the Constituent Assembly of India which included duly appointed representatives of the United State provided a suitable basis for strengthening the relation between the two States. The proclamation then went on to say- ''And whereas by virtue of the power vested in it under the Covenant establishing this State, the Legislative Assembly of the State has resolved that the Constitution framed by the Constituent Assembly of India be adopted by this State. I now hereby declare and direct-
That the Constitution of India shortly to be adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India shall be the Constitution for the United State of Travancore and Cochin as for the other parts of India and shall be enforced as such in accordance with the tenor of its provisions.
That the provisions of the said Constitution shall as from the date of its commencement, supersede and abrogate all other constitutional provisions inconsistent therewith which are at present in force in this State."
The Constitution of India came into force on January 26, 1950, and on that date Travancore-Cochin became one of the Part B States within the Constitution of India. Under that Constitution the subject of "taxes on income other than agricultural income" was included in the Union Legislative List and Parliament alone' had exclusive power to; make laws in respect thereof All laws in force in the territory of Travancore-Cochin became subject to the Constitution of lndia when it came into force; but Art. 277 of the Constitution enaccted-
So far we have traced the constitutional history of the integration of Travancore-Cochin, its accession to the Dominion of India and finally its acceptance of the Constitution of India whereby it became a Part B State within the Constitution of India. We now go back to the story of the assessments made on the assessee. The income of the assessee for the two accounting years, 1122 and 1123 M.E. (corresponding to the years ending on August 16, 1947, and August 16, 1948, respectively) was assessed in the two assessment years, 1123 and 1124 M.E. in accordance with the Cochin Act by the Income-tax Officer at Ernakulam by his orders dated July 28, 1949, and January 31, 1950, respectively. These assessments, the assessee alleged, became final and he paid the taxes accordingly. Similarly, the income of the assessee in Travancore for the accounting years 1122 and 1123 M.E. was assessed under the Travancore Act for the assessment years 1123 and 1124 by the Income-tax Officer, Kottayam, by his orders dated April 11, 1949, and July 30, 1949, and these assessments also, according to the assessee, became final and he paid the taxes accordingly. The income of the assessee for the accounting year 1124 M.E.was assessed under the Indian Incometax Act ' 1922, in the assessment year 1951-52 by the Income-tax Officer, Ernakulam, by his order dated January 21, 1952. The account books of the assessee were rejected as unreliable and the Income-tax Officer, Ernakulam, made a " best of judgment "
escaped income "
The Committee submitted a report in due course and made certain recommendations. On the basis of those recommendations certain agreements were entered into between the President of India and the Rajpramukhs, including the Rajpramukh of Travancore-Cochin and the Rajpramukh of Mysore. We shall refer in somewhat greater detail to these agreements, particularly the agreements entered into by the Rajpramukhs of Travancore-Cochin and Mysore. The contention on behalf of the assessee is that these agreements with Part B States with regard to certain financial matters received constitutional sanctity in Art. 278 of the Constitution (now repealed by the Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956). Article 278, so far as it is relevant for our purpose, was in these terms " 278 (1). Notwithstanding anything in the Constitution, the Government of India may, subject to the provisions of clause (2), enter into an agreement with the Government of a State specified in Part B of the First Schedule with respect to-
(a)the levy and collection of any tax or duty leviable by the Government of India in such State and for the distribution of the proceeds thereof otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter ;
(b)............
(c)............
and, when an agreement is so entered into, the provisions of this Chapter shall in relation to such State have effect subject to the terms of such agreement." The argument on behalf of the assessee is that the recommendations of the Indian States Finances Enquiry Committee which were accepted by the Rajpramukh of Travancore-Cochin in the agreement entered into by the Rajpramukh with the President of India on February 25, 1950, were designed to secure " legal continuity of pending proceedings " and " finality and validity of completed proceedings " under the preexisting State legislation ; therefore, s. 13(1) of the Finance Act, 1950, should be so construed as to be in consonance with the aforesaid agreement, and, in the alternative, if s. 13(1) is construed to be at variance with the aforesaid financial agreement, it should be held to be void by reason of the; provisions; of Arts. 278 and 295 of the Constitution.
We proceed now to a consideration in detail of the arguments urged before us on behalf of the assessee in the Travancore- Cochin appeals. In logical sequence the point as to the absence of foundation for the -action taken by the two Income-tax Officers of Ernakulam and Kottayam in the matter of the issue, of" notices. for reassessment, comes first and we propose now to deal with it. It is necessary at this stage to set out the two sections under which the Income-tax Officers proposed to take action against the assessee. The two sections are s. 44 of the Cochin Act and s. 47 of the Travancore Act. Section, 44 of the Cochin Act, so far as it is relevant for our purpose, is in these terms-
Section 47 (1) of the Travancore Act is identical ill terms and need not therefore be, quoted. It is worthy, of note that the terms of the. aforesaid two sections are similar to s. 34 of, the Indian Income tax Act, 1922, as it,.stood after the amending Act of 1939 and, before the amendments of 1948. The two requisites conditions for the application of the section are contained in the first part, and they are: firstly, there must be definite information which has come into possession of the Income-tax Officer and, secondly, in consequence of that information, the Income-fax Officer discovers that,, income, profits or gains chargeable to income-tax have escaped assessment in any year etc. It is only when these two conditions are fulfilled that the Income-tax Officer can take necessary action under s. 44. The question before us is whether these two conditions were fulfilled in the cases out of which the TravancoreCochin appeals have arisen.
As in the High Court so also before us, the only document on which the Income-tax Officers relied for this part of their case is Ext. VIII. This document, according to the Income- tax Officers, furnished the definite information in consequence of which they made the necessary discovery. Learned counsel for the assessee has taken us through Ext. VIII, Ext. A (statement of the case submitted by the assessee to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner) and the order of the Appellate Commissioner, dated December 14, 1953, and he has contended that (1) Ext. VIII does not relate to the years in question and cannot, therefore, constitute definite information for those years; (2) it gives certain highly speculative grounds for discrediting the account books of the assessee, which grounds have not been accepted by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner; and (3) in any view, it contained no information on which the Income-tax Officers could be said to have made any discovery. As to (1) above, the High Court rightly pointed out that Ext. VIII contained information of a kind which disclosed a definite and systematic pattern of transactions for avoidance of tax not only in respect of the year covered by the order but spread over years anterior to it. Secondly, Ext. VIII disclosed, according to the Income-tax Officers concerned, a systematic suppression of cash Bales., a regular trade in purchase and sale of controlled commodities at profiteering rates, passing bogus bills for purchases, understating stocks, segregating stocks for clandestine sales, and selling goods to the branches at artificial book losses. There can be no doubt that all this information, if honestly believed, would reasonably support the opinion of the Income-tax Officers that there is a discovery of " escaped " income etc., within the meaning of s. 44 of the Cochin Act and s. 47 of the Travancore Act. But learned counsel for the assessee argues that while it may be right to say that Ext. VIII prima facie contains the kind of information which will satisfy the conditions of s. 44 of the Cochin Act and s. 47 of the Travancore Act, we must take note of the fact that according to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, as shown by his order dated December 14, 1953, the so-called information contained in Ext. VIII was really non-existent, and the information being non- existent, there was no foundation for the action taken by the Income-tax Officers. We are unable to accept this argument as correct. Apart from the consideration that the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner was not available when the Income-tax Officers issued their notices, we think that the argument overstates the effect of the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner. It is true that the Appellate Assistant Commissioner considered in detail the various criticisms of the Income-tax Officer with regard to the account books along with the explanations offered on behalf of the assessee; but he expressed his final conclusion in the following words:
It cannot, therefore, be Raid that the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner washed out the entire information contained in Ext. VIII so as to strike at the very root of the jurisdiction of the Income-tax Officers concerned to issue the notices in question. It is to be remembered that there is a distinction between receipt of definite information as a consequence of which a discovery is made and a notice is issued, and the final determination as to the liability or extent of liability for escaped assessment etc. We accept as correct the view expressed in Firm Jitanram Nirmalram v. Commissioner of Income-tax (1), that the phrase " definite information " cannot be construed in a universal sense and its meaning must depend on and vary with the circumstances of each case. There is no doubt, however, that the information must be definite, that is, more than mere guess, gossip or rumour. There must also be a causal connexion between the information and the discovery; but " discovery " in (1) A.I.R. 1952 Pat. 163.
the context of the section does not mean a conclusion of certainty at the stage of notice. What is necessary at that stage is that the Income-tax Officer should have formed an honest belief upon materials which reasonably support such belief. This, in our opinion, is the correct view, and judged from that standpoint, Ext. VIII fulfilled the requirements of s. 44 of the Cochin Act and s. 47 of the Travancore Act.
We now turn to the construction of s. 13 (1) of the Finance Act, 1950. The argument on this point has meandered over a wide area; but it is really dependent on the meaning to be given to the expression for the purposes Of the levy, assessment and collection of income-tax and super-tax "
to this decision in support of its view on the construction of s. 13 (1). We are unable to accept these contentions as correct; nor do we think that the decision cited supports the view expressed by the Mysore High Court. The facts in Khemchands case (1) were briefly these. The firm of Khemchand applied to the Incometax Officer to have the firm registered, the consequence of such registration being that the profits of the firm would not be assessable to super- tax. On January 17, 1927, the Income-tax Officer assessed the firm to income-tax for the year 1926-27 under s. 23, sub-s. (4) of the Act; but no super tax was imposed as the firm having applied for registration was registered. Notice of demand for the amount assessed was made in 1927. Subsequently, the Commissioner ordered the cancellation of registration, and directed the Income-tax Officer to take necessary action thereupon. On May 4, 1929, the Income-tax Officer imposed super-tax and issued a notice of demand in May, 1929. The question in the appeal was whether the Income-tax authorities had any jurisdiction to assess Khemchand's firm to super tax for the year 1926-27. Their Lordships pointed out that the powers of the Commissioner tinder s. 33 could only be exercised subject to the provisions of the Act, of which the provisions in ss. 34 and 35 were important. They held that it was debatable whether the circumstances of the case were such as to bring it within s. 34 and so far as s. 35 was concerned, the Income-tax Officer was hopelessly barred by time. In that context, their Lordships said:
limited by those sections. In the present case the liability of the respondents both for income-tax and for super-tax wag determined by the Income-tax Officer on January 17, 1927. In the order made by him on that date he assessed the respondents to income-tax at the maximum rate, but as the respondents were at that time a registered firm he held, as he was bound to hold, that no super-tax was to be levied. On some date before the end of March, 1927, he served on the respondents a notice of demand for the tax that he had determined was properly leviable. The assess- ment having been made under s. 23, sub-s. (4), no appeal lay in respect of it. The assessment of the respondents was therefore final both in respect of income-tax and super-tax. Their liability in respect of both taxes had been finally determined, and none the less because the question of their liability to supertax had been determined in their favour. It was, indeed, contended before their Lordships that the assessment could not be regarded as having been determined inasmuch as the Commissioner might at any time, and apparently after any lapse of time, however long, cancel the registration of the respondents as a registered firm and so subject the respondents to liability to pay super-tax. Their Lordships would, in any case, hesitate long before acceding to a contention that would lead to so extravagant results. In their opinion, however, the contention cannot prevail. The Commissioner's powers under s. 33 can only be exercised subject to the provisions of the Act, of which the provisions in ss. 34 and 35 are in this respect of the greatest importance."
These observations lend no support to the view that the word" assessment" must always bear a particular meaning in the Income-tax Act. On the contrary, at p. 247 of the report, their Lordships said:
If the word ' assessment ' is taken in its comprehensive sense, as we think it should be taken in the context of s. 13(1) of the Finance Act, 1950, it would include I re- assessment' made under the provisions of the Act. Such 're- assessment' will without doubt come within the expression 'levy, assessment and collection of income-tax'. In his speech in Commissioners For General Purposes of Income-Tax For City of London v. Gibbs and Others (1), Lord Simon has pointed out that the word 'assessment' is used in the English Incometax Code in more than one sense; and sometimes within the bounds of the same section, two separate meanings of the word may be found. One meaning is the fixing of the sum taken to represent the actual profit and the other the actual sum in tax which the taxpayer is liable to pay. It has been contended before us that the Finance Act and the Income-tax Act should be read together as forming one Code, and so read the words I assessment' and I re-assessment 'acquire definite and distinct connotations. We are unable to agree, for the reasons which we have already given, that even if we read the Finance Act along with the Income-tax Act the word ' assessment' can be given a restricted meaning. To repeat those reasons: the income-tax code itself uses the word assessment in different senses, and in the context and collocation of the words of the Finance Act, the word 'assessment' is capable of bearing a comprehensive meaning only. We can find no good. reasons for holding that in the matter of levy, assessment and collection of income- tax, the Finance Act, 1950, contemplated that some persons should enjoy a,, (1)[1942] A.C. 402, 406.
privilege and escape payment of the full tax leviable under the provisions of the relevant Act. On this point we approve of the decision in Firm L. Hazari Mal v. Income-tax Officer, Ambala (1), where Bhandari C. J., said-
The modifications which follow have no bearing on the question at issue and need not be set out. Now, let us examine the relevant recommendations of the Committee, which are accepted by the Parties and form part of the agreement. These recommendations are summarised in para. 9 of the annexure to Part I of the Committee's report, and are set out below-
certain important issues of a legal nature will arise in connection with the actual taking over of " federal "
finality and validity " of completed proceedings under the pre-existing State legislation-, we think the whole body of State legislation relating to " federal " subjects should be repealed and the corresponding body of Central legislation extended proprio vigore to the States, with effect from the prescribed date or as and when the administration of particular " federal " subject is assumed by the Centre.
(b)For the above purpose, as well as for future "federal" administration in States, it may be necessary specifically to extend not merely the legislative, but also the executive and administrative competence of the Centre, its officers and " authorities ", and the judicial authority of its Courts, to the territories of the States.
(c)Such State Courts (except Courts of final appeal from orders of the State High Courts) as may in fact correspond to particular grades and classes of "British Indian" Courts (Civil and Criminal) may have to be statutorily " recognised " as " corresponding judicial authorities " for purpose of dealing with cases arising in the States under the " federal " laws of the Union of India; and the Supreme Court in India will have to be made the Court of final appeal from decisions of the State High Courts to the same extent as in the case of Provincial High Courts.
(d) Those sections of the various Indian Acts and Ordinances which set out their territorial " extent of application " will require amending so as to include State territories with effect from the prescribed date.
(e)It will be necessary to provide that all matters and proceedings pending under, or arising out of, the preexisting State Acts shall be disposed of under those Acts, by so far as may be, the " corresPonding authorities ", (nominated by the Chief Executive Authority) under the corresponding Indian Acts."
In view of the fact that the members of the Committee themselves felt that the legal issues involved in the actual taking over of " federal " subjects in the States by the Centre constituted a difficult subject on which they were not qualified to offer competent advice and their further statement that they were merely endeavouring to indicate the main features of what they considered to be required in order to establish " continuity of proceedings ", it has been argued before us on behalf of the Income-tax authorities that it would be wrong to treat the recomendations as binding statutory rules, even though the financial agreement between the high contracting Parties states generally that the recommendations are accepted; it is contended that the Committee in express terms states that the recommendations merely endeavour to indicate the main features of what the Committee thought was required, and they should not be placed on a pedestal higher than what the Committee itself did. We think that there is much force in this contention; but in the view which we have taken of these recommendations, we do not think that it is necessary to decide finally what constitutional sanctity they have acquired by reason of their acceptance in the financial agreement and the provisions of Art. 278 of the Constitution. Assuming but without deciding that they have binding force, what is their true meaning and effect? The argument on behalf of the assessee is that cl. (a) of the recommendations is the operative clause, and inasmuch as it talks of " continuity of pending proceedings " and "
We see no good grounds why full effect should not be given to it; it is one of the limitations, as stated in cl. (a), subject to which the State law is to be repealed. The matter is made still more clear by what is stated in the paragraph that immediately follows, viz. paragraph 10 of the annexure to the report of the Committee. That paragraph states-
really no doubt left in the matter. The Committee did not restrict the limitations they were suggesting, to a proceeding which was actually pending on the date of repeal of the State law; it gave a wider meaning to pending proceedings-that is, "proceedings pending under and arising out of the preexisting State Acts". It is to be remembered that where an assessment starts with a notice under s. 34 of the Indian Income-tax Act (or corresponding section of the Cochin or Travancore Act), all the relevant provisions of that Act apply as effectively as where the assessment starts with a notice under s. 22 (2)-or corresponding section of the Cochin or Travancore Act-in the ordinary course. It is also not disputed that the assessment made under s. 34 in any year subsequent to the relevant assessment year must be made as if it were made in the relevant assessment year, and the assessment must be based on the provisions of the Act as it stood in the year in which the income ought to have been assessed. Having regard to these considerations, we find no difficulty in holding that a re-assessment proceeding under s. 44, Cochin Act, or s. 47, Travancore Act, is a proceeding which comes under cl. (e) of the recommendations of the Committee, and must be disposed of under the preexisting State law. Section 13 (1) of the Finance Act, 1950, gives effect to that recommendation. There is, therefore, nothing in the recommendations which would restrict the meaning of the expression " levy, assessment and collection of income- tax " in s. 13 (1) of the Finance Act; nor do they bring s. 13 (1) into conflict with Arts. 278 and 295 of the Constitution.
We accordingly hold that there is no substance in any of the three points urged on behalf of the assessee in the Travancore-Cochin appeals.
Mysore Appeals.
These are eight appeals and the relevant facts are these. Civil Appeals 27 to 30 of 1956 arise out of four writ petitions numbered 52 and 53 of 1953, and 105 and 106 of 1954, which were dealt with together in the Mysore High Court by a common judgment dated December 14, 1954. Civil Appeals 161 to 164 also arise out of four writ petitions (no. 122 of 1954 and nos. 35 to 37 of 1955) filed in the same High Court. The orders passed in those writ petitions were that they were governed by the aforesaid decision dated
-December 14, 1954. ln the result, all the writ petitions were allowed with costs.
In all these cases the petitioners, who are respondents before us, were assessed to income-tax under the Mysore Income-tax Act, 1923 (hereinafter called the Mysore Act) for different years previous to the integration of Mysore with India, and the assessment proceedings were completed and closed under the Mysore Act by demand notices issued by the Income-tax Officers concerned. But subsequent to the integration of Mysore, notices under s. 34 of the Mysore Act were issued against the petitioners, and they challenged the jurisdiction of the Income-tax Officers to issue such notices. Section 34 of the Mysore Act states-
It corresponds to s. 34 of the Indian Income-tax Act as it stood prior to the amending Act of 1939 and the general scheme of the Mysore Act was the same as that of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, as it stood before 1939. The two grounds on which the jurisdiction of the Income-tax Officers was challenged were-
(1) Under the Finance Act, 1950, the Mysore Act stood repealed on and from April 1, 1950, and s. 13 (1) of the Finance Act kept alive the Mysore Act for the purpose of levy; assessment and collection of incometax etc. for the period mentioned therein, but did not save s. 34 of the Mysore Act for the purpose of reassessment of income-tax; therefore, the notices issued under s. 34 of the Mysore Act were without jurisdiction and authority.
(2) Even otherwise, the financial agreement between the President of India and the Rajpramukh of Mysore on February 28, 1950, which received constitutional sanctity in Art. 278 of the Constitution rendered the initiation of such re- assessment proceedings against the respondents unconstitutional and void.
The learned Chief Justice of the Mysore High Court upheld ground no. (1) and considered it unnecessary to pronounce on the second ground. Mallapa J., in a separate but concurring judgment expressed the view that having regard to the wording of s. 13 (1) of Finance Act, 1950, and the financial agreement of February 28, 1950, he had no doubt that s. 13 (1) did not provide for re-assessment under s. 34 of the Mysore Act. The process of integration of Mysore with India was similar to. that of Travancore-Cochin. The State of ,.Mysore acceded to the Dominion of India by an Instrument of Accession executed on August 9, 1947, and accepted by the Governor-General on August 16, 1947. A supplementary Instrument of Accession was executed on June 1, 1949. By a Proclamation dated November 25, 1949, the Constitution of India to be adopted by the Constituent Assembly of India was accepted for Mysore, and on January 26,1950, Mysore became a Part B State within the Constitution of India. A similar financial agreement was entered into by the Rajpramukh with the President of India on February 28, 1950. On April 1, 1950, the Finance Act, 1950, applied the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, to Mysore, subject to the provisions of s. 13 thereof.
In dealing with the Travancore-Cochin appeals, we have fully dealt with the two grounds on which the respondent assessees in the Mysore appeals challenged the jurisdiction of the Income-tax Officers concerned to issue the notices under. s. 34 of The Mysore Act. Two additional points urged in support of ground no. (1) maybe stated here. It has been urged that the proviso to s. 34 of the Mysore Act brings out the distinction between I assessment ' and ' re-assessment '; and secondly, it is contended that the jurisdiction under s. 34 is limited to ascertainment of extra income not assessed and the section does not confer jurisdiction to make a new assessment, for taxing whole of that assessment, under the Act. Learned counsel for the assessees has invited our attention to In re Kashi Nath Bagla (1); Madhavjee Damodar Thackersay and Another v. Commissioner of Income Tax, BOMBAY(2) and Anglo-French Textile Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Madras, No. 4 (3). The real question for decision in these appeals is the true scope and effect of s. 13 (1) of the Finance Act, and on that question the additional points' mentioned (1) A. 1. R. 1932 All. 1. (2) [1935] 3 I.T. R. 457. (3) [1950] 18 1. T. R. 106.
above throw very little light. There is, indeed, a dis- tinction between an original or normal assessment under s. 23 and a re-assessment under s. 34; but we' have shown that the word " assessment " has been used in more than one sense in Income-tax law, and( so far as s. 13 (1) of the Finance Act, 1950, is concerned, there is no doubt that the expression I levy, assessment and collection of income-tax' has been used in a comprehensive sense so as to include the whole procedure for imposing liability upon the taxpayer. Result :
Appeals Nos. 143 to 145 dismissed.
Appeals No. 27 to 30 and 161 to 164 allowed.	Total Judgement
