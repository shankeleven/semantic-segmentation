Virendra Singh And Others vs The State Of Uttar Pradesh on 29 April, 1954	Case Title
ORIGINAL JURISDICTION: Petition No.37 of 1953. Under article 32 of the Constitution of India, praying that the Order of the Governor of Uttar Pradesh dated the 29th August, 1952, revoking the grants made by the Rulers of Charkhari and Sarila in favour of the petitioners be declared void.
K. S. Krishna Swamy Iyengar, and S. P. Sinha (Bishan Singh and S. S. Shukla, with them) for the petitioners. Gopalji Mehrotra and C. P. Lal for the respondent. C. K. Daphtary, Solicitor-General for India (G. N. Joshi, Porus -A. Mehta and P. G. Gokhale, with him) for the Intervener.
1954. April 29. The Order of the Court was pronounced by BosE J.-This is a petition under article 32 of the the Constitution. It raises an important question about the post-Constitutional rights to property situate in Indian States that were not part of British India before the Constitution but which acceded to the Dominion of India shortly before the Constitution and became an integral part of the Indian Republic after it.
Broadly speaking, the effect of the accession was to retain to the Rulers their full autonomy and sovereignty except on three subjects: Defence, External Affairs and Communications. These were transferred to the Central Government of the new Dominion.
Article IV (2) The said amount is intended to cover all the expenses of the Ruler and his family............ and shall neither be increased nor reduced for any reason what- soever. "	Issue
The alienations now in question were made in January, 1948. On 5th January, 1948, the Ruler of Sarila granted the village Rigwara to the petitioners and on 28th January, 1948, the Ruler of Charkhari granted the villages Patha, Kua and Aichana, also to the petitioners.
Orders were accordingly issued to the Revenue Officers concerned to "abstain from interfering in such grants." This decision was communicated to the Rulers of Charkhari and Sarila on 13th March, 1949. They were told that their grants would be respected.
The integration did not work satisfactorily, so, on 26th December, 1949, the same thirty five Rulers entered into another agreement abrogating their covenant and dissolving the newly created State as from 1ST January, 1950. By the same instrument each Ruler ceded to the Government of the Indian Dominion as from the same date "full and exclusive authority, jurisdiction and powers for, and in relation to, the governance of that State." Article II provided that "As from the aforesaid day, the United State of Vindhya Pradesh shall cease to exist, and all the property, assets and liabilities of that State, as well as its rights, duties and obligations, shall be those of the Government of India." This Instrument was called the Vindhya Pradesh Merger Agreement. The Government of the Indian Dominion was also a party and its Secretary in the Ministry of States appended his signature to the document. Each Ruler was guaranteed a privy parse and all the personal privileges, dignities and titles enjoyed by him at the date of the Agreement. Imme- diately after the clause guaranteeing the privy purse comes the following-
The Dominion Government took over the administration of the States which formed Vindhya Pradesh on 1st January, 1950, and decided to form them into a Chief Commissioner's Province. It did this by a Notification of the Governor- General dated 22nd January, 1950, and brought the new Province into being on 23rd January, 1950. But the four villages we are concerned with (called enclaves) were taken out of this Province on 25th January, 1950, and absorbed into the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh) by an Order of the Governor-General entitled the Provinces and States (Absorption of Enclaves) Order, 1950. This Order was made under sections 290, 290-A and 290-B of the Government of India Act, 1935. The portions of that Order relevant for the present purpose are these:
The Constitution came into force on 26th January, decided to reopen the question of revocation which the Vindhya Pradesh Government had settled on 7th December, 1948, and on 29th August, 1952, more than two and a half years after the Constitution and four and a half years after the grants, the Uttar Pradesh Government,in consultation with the Government of India, revoked the grants with which we are concerned. The Governor of Uttar Pradesh issued the following order on 29th August, 1952 :	Facts
And clause 8 provided that-
One other clause is important, clause 6, which provided that-
Courts of justice in West Rand Central Gold Mining Company v. Rex(1) and set out reasons for the above conclusion. The learned counsel for the petitioners also relies on another limitation which the English Courts have placed on an act of State. He says that even if the right to con- fiscate be conceded it must be taken to have been waived if either the Crown or its officers purport to act under colour of a legal title and not arbitrarily. He contended that arbitrariness was of the essence in a', act of State. He relied on Secretary of State in Council of India v. Kamachee Boye Sehaba(2),Forester v. Secretary of State for India in Council (3) and Johnstone v. Pedlar(4). He pointed out that the affidavit of the respondent shows that Government decided to confirm all grants except those which were mala fide. Therefore, this was no arbitrary act of annexation but an attempt to exercise what was thought to be a legal right.	PetArg
The operative order of revocation was made by the Governor of Uttar Pradesh, and under the Constitution it is clear that no State Government has the right to do anything in the nature of an act of State, but in view of the fact that the revocation was made in consultation with the Government of India, we were I asked to treat the Uttar Pradesh Governor as a delegate of the sovereign authority whose act has been approved and ratified by that authority, along the lines of Buron v. Denman(1), The Secretary of State in Council of India v. Kamachee Boye Sahaba(2) and Johnstone v. Pedlar(3), and to decide on that basis whether the Union Government had the right and power to revoke these grants as an act of State.
Jurists hold divergent views on this matter. Atone extreme is the view of the Privy Council in a series of cases. Their effect was summarised in Vajesingji Joravarsingji v. Secretary of State for India in Council(1) and again in Secretary of State v. Sardar Rustam Khan(5) in the following words:
According to the Privy Council in Secretary of State for India in Council v. Bai Rajbai (1) and also in Vajesingji Joravarsingji v. Secretary of State for India in Council (9), the burden of proving that the new sovereign has recognised the old rights lies on the party asserting it. The learned Solicitor-General relies on these cases. At the other extreme is the view of Chief Justice John Marshall of the United States Supreme Court. He said in the United States v. Percheman (3) in the year 1833:
This view was followed by Cardozo J. in 1937 in Shapleigh v. Mier (1). He said :-
We gather from Hyde's International Law, Volume I, second edition, page 433, that the came principle was laid down by the Permanent Court of International Justice. The learned author quotes the Court as saying in its Sixth Advisory Opinion of September 10, 1923, on certain questions relating to settlers of German origin in the territory ceded by Germany to Poland-
The learned counsel for the petitioners relies on this class of case and derives this much support for it from the Privy Council in Mayor of Lyons v. East India Company (2) where Lord Brougham said: - -
(1) 299 U.S. 468 at 470. (2) I M.I.A, 175 at 270, 271, It is right however to point out that Hyde places limitations on the doctrine at page 432 and that the learned authors of Corpus Juris: International Law, Volume 33, page 415, place the limitation that in the absence of express understanding a conqueror assumes no obligations of the conquered state. This distinction was also drawn by Lord Alverstone C.J. in West Rand Central Gold Mining Company v. Rex (1) where, commenting on the American cases, he said that there is a difference between the private rights of individuals in private property and contractual rights which are sought to be enforced against the new sovereign. He said :-
Lord Alverstone also pointed out that in the American cases, on which the international jurists have based their views, the treaties of cession as well as the subsequent legislation of the United States protected the rights of owners of private property as they existed at the time of cession and so the only question for decision in each of those cases was whether any private rights of property actually existed at the relevant date. Now that is also the English law, for the Privy Council and the House of Lords have also held that the new sovereign can choose to waive his rights and recognise titles and rights as they existed at the date of cession.
(1) [T905] 2 K.B. 391 at 411.
This recognition can be given either by legislation or by proclamation and it can even be inferred from the mode of dealing with the property after the cession: Forester v. Secretary of State for India in Council ( ) (legislation); Secretary of State v. Bai Rajbai (2) (agreement, legislation and mode of dealing); Mayor of Lyons v. East India Company (3) (waiver) and at page 285 (relinquishment) ; also Vajesinghji Joravarsinghji v. Secretary of State for India(1) and Secretary of State v. Sardar Rustam Khan (5).
In dealing with the views of international jurists, Lord Halsbury insisted that they were only enunciations of what in their opinion the law ought to be and had no binding force. He said in the House of Lords in Cook v. Sorigg (6):
His view was endorsed by the Privy Council in Secretary of State v. Sardar Rustam Khan(5) and again in the House of Lords in Johnstone v. Pedlar(7). Lord Alverstone C. J. analysed in detail how far international law can be accepted and applied in municipal (1) 1872-73 I.A. Supplt. Io at 17.

We do not intend to discuss any of this because, in our opinion, none of these decisions has any bearing on the problem which confronts us, namely, the impact of the Constitution on the peoples and territories which joined the Indian Union and brought the Constitution into being. The flow of events up to the date of final accession, 1st January, 1950, are only of historical interest in the present matter. The Rulers of Charkhari and Sarila retained, at the moment of final cession, whatever measure of sovereignty they had when paramountly lapsed, less the portion given to the Indian Dominion by their Instruments of Accession in 1947; they lost none of it during the interlude when they toyed with the experiment of integration. There was then redistribution of some of its aspects but the whole of whatever they possessed before the integration returned to each when the United State of Vindhya Pradesh was brought to an end and ceased to exist. Thereafter each acceded to the Dominion of India in his own right.
The final Instrument of Accession complies with sub- section (1) above. The necessary Order was made and the Chief Commissioner's Province of Vindhya Pradesh, which at that date included the property in dispute, came into being on 23rd January. 1950. Now it is beyond dispute that there neither can, nor could, be confiscation of property, as an act of State in the Chief Commissioner's Province of Delhi. It is difficult to see how there could be in an area which was being administered by the Dominion Government in all respects as a Chief Commissioner's Province even if the person in possession was not, at the time, a national of the country, an assumption which is by no means indisputable; indeed that is the effect of the decision of the Privy Council in Mayor of Lyons v. East India Company(1). There would appear to have been a clear election by the sovereign authority expressed in its own legislation to waive its rights of confiscation even if they were there (a point we do not decide); and the same consequences followed when the properties in dispute were incorporated into the State of Uttar Pradesh, two days later, on 25th January, 1950. The Privy Council go even further in Mayor of Lyons v. East India Company at page 285 and say that the waiver or relinquishment can be established from the treaty itself.
Now what was the effect of the non-exercise of those rights ? Even on the English view, the, person in de facto possession is not without rights in the land, nor is he altogether without remedy. It is just a question of the means of redress. In Johnstone v. Pedlar(1) Lord Atkinson, speaking in the House of Lords, said:-
So also in Forester v. Secretary of State for India(9), the Begum, whose estate Government sought to confiscate as an act of State, was only in de facto possession: see page
16. The Privy Council held that the Government had purported to act under colour of a legal title, so its attempt at resumption was not an act of State and consequently could be reviewed in the Courts. Their Lordships thereupon proceeded to investigate the Begum's title, not under the British Government, but as derived from the sovereign power which preceded it (page 18). So also in Mayor of Lyons v. East India Company(3), the title of a foreign alien to land was upheld, not under the English law (because if that had applied there would have been an escheat), but under the law in India derived from non- British sources, that is to say, under the laws of the land before cession. It was held that those laws continued until changed and for that reason a title which would have been bad under the English law was upheld. At page 274 their Lordships say:-
and at page 271 they had already said "In the former case, it is allowed, that the law of the country continues until the Crown, or the Legislature, change it."
Lord Atkinson's view in Johnstone v. Pedlar(1) at page 281 appears to point to the same conclusion. He said: -
We think it is clear on a review of these authorities ,that whichever view be taken, that of the Privy Council and the House of Lords, or that of Chief Justice Marshall, these petitioners, who were in de facto possession of the disputed lands, had rights in them which they could have enforced up to 26th January, 1950, in the Dominion Courts against all persons except possibly the Rulers who granted the land and except possibly the State. We do not by 'any means intend to suggest that they could not have enforced them against the Rulers and the Dominion of India as well, but for reasons which we shall presently disclose it is not necessary to enter into that particular controversy. It is enough for the purposes of this case to hold that the petitioners had, at any rate, the rights defined above. (1) [1921] 2 A. C. 262, (2) (1860) 29 Beav. 300, Now what was the extent of the petitioners' rights? These properties were not State properties in the sense of public buildings and so forth. They were indisputably properties over which the Rulers bad absolute rights of disposition at the date of the grants. The grants are absolute in character and would under any civilised system of, law pass an absolute and indefeasible title to the grantee. Let it be conceded, as was argued (though we do not so decide), that they were defensible at the mere will of a sovereign who held absolute and despotic sway over his subjects in all domestic concerns. The fact remains that up till that time they were neither resumed by the former rulers nor confiscated by the Dominion of India as an act of State. Therefore, up to the 25th of January, 1950, the right and title of the petitioners to continue in possession was good, at any rate, against all but the Rulers and the Dominion of India.
This invitation was accepted on 19th May, 1949. Page 109 of the White Paper says "As the States came closer to the Centre it became clear that the idea of separate Constitutions being framed for different constituent units of the Indian Union was a legacy from the Rulers' polity which could have no place in a democratic set-up. The matter was, therefore, further discussed by the Ministry of States with the Premiers of Unions and States on May 19, 1949, and it was decided, with their concurrence, that the Constitution of the States should also be framed by the Constituent Assembly of India and should form part of the Constitution of India." It is impossible to think of those who -sat down together
-in the Constituent Assembly, and of those who sent representatives there, as conqueror and conquered, as those who ceded and as those who absorbed, as sovereigns or their plenipotentiaries, contracting alliances and entering into treaties as high contracting parties to an act of State. They were not there as sovereign and subject as citizen and alien, but as the sovereign peoples of India, free democratic equals, forging the pattern of a new life for the common weal. Every vestige of sovereignty was abandoned by the Dominion of India and by the States and surrendered to the peoples of the land who through their representatives in the Constituent Assembly hammered out for themselves a new Constitution in which all were citizens in a new order having but one ie, and owing but one allegiance: devotion, loyalty, idelity, to the Sovereign Democratic Republic that is India. At one stroke all other territorial allegiances were wiped out and the past was obliterated except where expressly preserved; at one moment of time the new order was born with its new allegiance springing from the same source for all, grounded on the same basis: the sovereign will of the, peoples of India with no class, no caste, no race, no creed, no distinction, no reservation.
Article 1(1) sets out that India shall be a Union of States and clauses (2) and (3) define the territories of which India shall be composed. They include the territories in which the disputed lands are situate. Article 5 defines Indian citizens. They include in their wide embrace the Rulers of Charkhari and Sarila who made the grants, the petitioners who received them and those who now seek as an act of State to make the confiscation. It is impossible for a sovereign to exercise an act of State against its own subjects. However disputable the proposition may be. that an act of State can be exercised against a citizen who was once an alien the right being only in abeyance till exercised, there has never been any doubt that it can never be exercised against one who has always been a citizen from the beginning in territory which has from its inception belonged to the State seeking to exercise the right. This is so even on the English authorities which claim far higher rights for the State than other laws seem to allow. Lord Atkinson said in Johnstone v. Pedlar(1) at page 281 :-
Lord Brougham went further in Mayor of Lyon8 v. East India Company(3), and extended the principle to aliens who later became citizens. He said at pages 284 and 285:-
But however that may be, there is no question of conquest or cession here., The new Republic was born on 26th January, 1950, and all derived their rights of citizenship from the same source and from the same moment of time; so also, at the same instant and for the same reason, all territory within its boundaries (1) [19211 2 A.C. 262. (3) 1 M.I.A. 175.
(2) [1892]A A.C. 491.
became the territory of India. There is, as it were from the point of view of the new State, Unity of Possession, Unity of Interest, Unity of Title and Unity of Time. This was also quite clearly the will of the Union Government as expressed in its White Paper, so even if the case was still one of cession there is clear evidence of relinquishment and waiver. At page 115 it is said :-	Precedent
The States in question here are Charkhari and Sarila. In British days they were independent States under the paramountcy of the British Crown. They acknowledged the British Crown as the suzerain power and owed a modified allegiance to it, but none to the Government of India. In 1947 India obtained Independence and became a Dominion by reason of the Indian Independence Act of 1947. The suzerainty of the British Crown over the Indian States lapsed at the same time because of section 7 of that Act. Immediately after, all but three of the Indian States acceded to the new Dominion by executing Instruments of Accession. Among them were the two States with which we are concerned. The new Dominion of India was empowered to accept these accessions by a suitable amendment in the Government of India Act, 1935. The sovereignty of the acceding States was expressly recognised and safeguarded. The operative words of the Instrument of Accession which each Ruler signed were-
Article VIII No enquiry shall be made by or under the authority of the Government of India, and no proceeding shall lie in any Court, against the Ruler of any Covenanting State, whether in a personal capacity or otherwise, in respect of anything done or omitted to be done by him or under his authority during the period of his administration of that State."
281. acts of State into whose competency no municipal Court could enquire; nor can any Court in India, after the Constitution, accept jurisdiction to settle any dispute arising out of them because of article 363 and the proviso to article 131; all they can do is to register the fact of accession; see section 6 of the Government of India Act, 1935, relating to the Accession of States. But what then? Whether the Privy Council view is correct or that put forward by Chief Justice Marshall its broadest outlines is more proper, all authoritiesd re-agreed that it is within the competence of the new sovereign to accord recognition to existing rights in the conquered or ceded territories and, by legislation or otherwise, to apply its own laws to them; and these laws can, and indeed when the occasion arises must, be examined and interpreted by the municipal Courts of the absorbing State.
Now in the present case, what happened after the final accession? There was already in existence in 1949 section 290-A of the Government of India Act, 1935, which provided as follows:
But however that may be, the fact remains that the titles of these petitioners to the disputed lands had not been repudiated tip to the 26th of January, 1950. It is immaterial whether or not the right of the Dominion Government to do so remained in abeyance till exercised despite the agreement embodied in the (1) I M. I.A. 175 at 274, 275 Instruments of Accession and the legislation and notification quoted above because, in fact, it was not exercised.	Section

ORIGINAL JURISDICTION: Petition No.37 of 1953. Under article 32 of the Constitution of India, praying that the Order of the Governor of Uttar Pradesh dated the 29th August, 1952, revoking the grants made by the Rulers of Charkhari and Sarila in favour of the petitioners be declared void.

1954. April 29. The Order of the Court was pronounced by BosE J.-This is a petition under article 32 of the the Constitution. It raises an important question about the post-Constitutional rights to property situate in Indian States that were not part of British India before the Constitution but which acceded to the Dominion of India shortly before the Constitution and became an integral part of the Indian Republic after it.
The States in question here are Charkhari and Sarila. In British days they were independent States under the paramountcy of the British Crown. They acknowledged the British Crown as the suzerain power and owed a modified allegiance to it, but none to the Government of India. In 1947 India obtained Independence and became a Dominion by reason of the Indian Independence Act of 1947. The suzerainty of the British Crown over the Indian States lapsed at the same time because of section 7 of that Act. Immediately after, all but three of the Indian States acceded to the new Dominion by executing Instruments of Accession. Among them were the two States with which we are concerned. The new Dominion of India was empowered to accept these accessions by a suitable amendment in the Government of India Act, 1935. The sovereignty of the acceding States was expressly recognised and safeguarded. The operative words of the Instrument of Accession which each Ruler signed were-
And clause 8 provided that-
Broadly speaking, the effect of the accession was to retain to the Rulers their full autonomy and sovereignty except on three subjects: Defence, External Affairs and Communications. These were transferred to the Central Government of the new Dominion.
One other clause is important, clause 6, which provided that-
The alienations now in question were made in January, 1948. On 5th January, 1948, the Ruler of Sarila granted the village Rigwara to the petitioners and on 28th January, 1948, the Ruler of Charkhari granted the villages Patha, Kua and Aichana, also to the petitioners.
After this, on 13th March, 1948, thirty five States in Bundelkhand and Baghelkhand (including Charkhari and Sarila) agreed to unite themselves into one State which was to be called the, United State of Vindhya Pradesh. In pursuance of this agreement each of the thirty five Rulers signed a covenant on 18th March, 1948, which brought the new State into being. It is important to note that this was a purely domestic arrangement between themselves and not a treaty with the Dominion of India. Each Ruler necessarily surrendered a fraction of his sovereignty to the whole but there was no further surrender of sovereign powers to the Dominion of India beyond those already surrendered in 1947, namely Defence, External Affairs and Communications. Despite the readjustment, the sum total of the sovereignties which had resided in each before the covenant now resided in the whole and its component parts: none of it was lost to the Dominion of India.
Soon after this, the Revenue Officers of the newly formed Vindhya Pradesh Union tried to interfere with the grants made by certain Rulers of the integrating States before the integration; among them were the grants in question here. This occasioned complaints to the Vindhya Pradesh Government and that Government decided on 7th December, 1948, to respect the impugned grants. The Revenue Minister's order of that date runs-
Orders were accordingly issued to the Revenue Officers concerned to "abstain from interfering in such grants." This decision was communicated to the Rulers of Charkhari and Sarila on 13th March, 1949. They were told that their grants would be respected.
The integration did not work satisfactorily, so, on 26th December, 1949, the same thirty five Rulers entered into another agreement abrogating their covenant and dissolving the newly created State as from 1ST January, 1950. By the same instrument each Ruler ceded to the Government of the Indian Dominion as from the same date "full and exclusive authority, jurisdiction and powers for, and in relation to, the governance of that State." Article II provided that "As from the aforesaid day, the United State of Vindhya Pradesh shall cease to exist, and all the property, assets and liabilities of that State, as well as its rights, duties and obligations, shall be those of the Government of India." This Instrument was called the Vindhya Pradesh Merger Agreement. The Government of the Indian Dominion was also a party and its Secretary in the Ministry of States appended his signature to the document. Each Ruler was guaranteed a privy parse and all the personal privileges, dignities and titles enjoyed by him at the date of the Agreement. Imme- diately after the clause guaranteeing the privy purse comes the following-
Article IV (2) The said amount is intended to cover all the expenses of the Ruler and his family............ and shall neither be increased nor reduced for any reason what- soever. "
Article VIII No enquiry shall be made by or under the authority of the Government of India, and no proceeding shall lie in any Court, against the Ruler of any Covenanting State, whether in a personal capacity or otherwise, in respect of anything done or omitted to be done by him or under his authority during the period of his administration of that State."
The Dominion Government took over the administration of the States which formed Vindhya Pradesh on 1st January, 1950, and decided to form them into a Chief Commissioner's Province. It did this by a Notification of the Governor- General dated 22nd January, 1950, and brought the new Province into being on 23rd January, 1950. But the four villages we are concerned with (called enclaves) were taken out of this Province on 25th January, 1950, and absorbed into the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh) by an Order of the Governor-General entitled the Provinces and States (Absorption of Enclaves) Order, 1950. This Order was made under sections 290, 290-A and 290-B of the Government of India Act, 1935. The portions of that Order relevant for the present purpose are these:
The Constitution came into force on 26th January, decided to reopen the question of revocation which the Vindhya Pradesh Government had settled on 7th December, 1948, and on 29th August, 1952, more than two and a half years after the Constitution and four and a half years after the grants, the Uttar Pradesh Government,in consultation with the Government of India, revoked the grants with which we are concerned. The Governor of Uttar Pradesh issued the following order on 29th August, 1952 :
The operative order of revocation was made by the Governor of Uttar Pradesh, and under the Constitution it is clear that no State Government has the right to do anything in the nature of an act of State, but in view of the fact that the revocation was made in consultation with the Government of India, we were I asked to treat the Uttar Pradesh Governor as a delegate of the sovereign authority whose act has been approved and ratified by that authority, along the lines of Buron v. Denman(1), The Secretary of State in Council of India v. Kamachee Boye Sahaba(2) and Johnstone v. Pedlar(3), and to decide on that basis whether the Union Government had the right and power to revoke these grants as an act of State.
Jurists hold divergent views on this matter. Atone extreme is the view of the Privy Council in a series of cases. Their effect was summarised in Vajesingji Joravarsingji v. Secretary of State for India in Council(1) and again in Secretary of State v. Sardar Rustam Khan(5) in the following words:
According to the Privy Council in Secretary of State for India in Council v. Bai Rajbai (1) and also in Vajesingji Joravarsingji v. Secretary of State for India in Council (9), the burden of proving that the new sovereign has recognised the old rights lies on the party asserting it. The learned Solicitor-General relies on these cases. At the other extreme is the view of Chief Justice John Marshall of the United States Supreme Court. He said in the United States v. Percheman (3) in the year 1833:
This view was followed by Cardozo J. in 1937 in Shapleigh v. Mier (1). He said :-
We gather from Hyde's International Law, Volume I, second edition, page 433, that the came principle was laid down by the Permanent Court of International Justice. The learned author quotes the Court as saying in its Sixth Advisory Opinion of September 10, 1923, on certain questions relating to settlers of German origin in the territory ceded by Germany to Poland-
The learned counsel for the petitioners relies on this class of case and derives this much support for it from the Privy Council in Mayor of Lyons v. East India Company (2) where Lord Brougham said: - -
(1) 299 U.S. 468 at 470. (2) I M.I.A, 175 at 270, 271, It is right however to point out that Hyde places limitations on the doctrine at page 432 and that the learned authors of Corpus Juris: International Law, Volume 33, page 415, place the limitation that in the absence of express understanding a conqueror assumes no obligations of the conquered state. This distinction was also drawn by Lord Alverstone C.J. in West Rand Central Gold Mining Company v. Rex (1) where, commenting on the American cases, he said that there is a difference between the private rights of individuals in private property and contractual rights which are sought to be enforced against the new sovereign. He said :-
Lord Alverstone also pointed out that in the American cases, on which the international jurists have based their views, the treaties of cession as well as the subsequent legislation of the United States protected the rights of owners of private property as they existed at the time of cession and so the only question for decision in each of those cases was whether any private rights of property actually existed at the relevant date. Now that is also the English law, for the Privy Council and the House of Lords have also held that the new sovereign can choose to waive his rights and recognise titles and rights as they existed at the date of cession.

This recognition can be given either by legislation or by proclamation and it can even be inferred from the mode of dealing with the property after the cession: Forester v. Secretary of State for India in Council ( ) (legislation); Secretary of State v. Bai Rajbai (2) (agreement, legislation and mode of dealing); Mayor of Lyons v. East India Company (3) (waiver) and at page 285 (relinquishment) ; also Vajesinghji Joravarsinghji v. Secretary of State for India(1) and Secretary of State v. Sardar Rustam Khan (5).
In dealing with the views of international jurists, Lord Halsbury insisted that they were only enunciations of what in their opinion the law ought to be and had no binding force. He said in the House of Lords in Cook v. Sorigg (6):
His view was endorsed by the Privy Council in Secretary of State v. Sardar Rustam Khan(5) and again in the House of Lords in Johnstone v. Pedlar(7). Lord Alverstone C. J. analysed in detail how far international law can be accepted and applied in municipal (1) 1872-73 I.A. Supplt. Io at 17.

Courts of justice in West Rand Central Gold Mining Company v. Rex(1) and set out reasons for the above conclusion. The learned counsel for the petitioners also relies on another limitation which the English Courts have placed on an act of State. He says that even if the right to con- fiscate be conceded it must be taken to have been waived if either the Crown or its officers purport to act under colour of a legal title and not arbitrarily. He contended that arbitrariness was of the essence in a', act of State. He relied on Secretary of State in Council of India v. Kamachee Boye Sehaba(2),Forester v. Secretary of State for India in Council (3) and Johnstone v. Pedlar(4). He pointed out that the affidavit of the respondent shows that Government decided to confirm all grants except those which were mala fide. Therefore, this was no arbitrary act of annexation but an attempt to exercise what was thought to be a legal right.
We do not intend to discuss any of this because, in our opinion, none of these decisions has any bearing on the problem which confronts us, namely, the impact of the Constitution on the peoples and territories which joined the Indian Union and brought the Constitution into being. The flow of events up to the date of final accession, 1st January, 1950, are only of historical interest in the present matter. The Rulers of Charkhari and Sarila retained, at the moment of final cession, whatever measure of sovereignty they had when paramountly lapsed, less the portion given to the Indian Dominion by their Instruments of Accession in 1947; they lost none of it during the interlude when they toyed with the experiment of integration. There was then redistribution of some of its aspects but the whole of whatever they possessed before the integration returned to each when the United State of Vindhya Pradesh was brought to an end and ceased to exist. Thereafter each acceded to the Dominion of India in his own right.
Now it is undoubted that the accessions and the acceptance of them by the Dominion of India were (1)[19O5] 2 K B 391 at 401-408. (3) 1872-73 I.A. Supplt. 10 at 17. (2) 7 M.I.A. 476 at 53I. (4) [1921] 2 A.C. 262 at
281. acts of State into whose competency no municipal Court could enquire; nor can any Court in India, after the Constitution, accept jurisdiction to settle any dispute arising out of them because of article 363 and the proviso to article 131; all they can do is to register the fact of accession; see section 6 of the Government of India Act, 1935, relating to the Accession of States. But what then? Whether the Privy Council view is correct or that put forward by Chief Justice Marshall its broadest outlines is more proper, all authoritiesd re-agreed that it is within the competence of the new sovereign to accord recognition to existing rights in the conquered or ceded territories and, by legislation or otherwise, to apply its own laws to them; and these laws can, and indeed when the occasion arises must, be examined and interpreted by the municipal Courts of the absorbing State.
Now in the present case, what happened after the final accession? There was already in existence in 1949 section 290-A of the Government of India Act, 1935, which provided as follows:
The final Instrument of Accession complies with sub- section (1) above. The necessary Order was made and the Chief Commissioner's Province of Vindhya Pradesh, which at that date included the property in dispute, came into being on 23rd January. 1950. Now it is beyond dispute that there neither can, nor could, be confiscation of property, as an act of State in the Chief Commissioner's Province of Delhi. It is difficult to see how there could be in an area which was being administered by the Dominion Government in all respects as a Chief Commissioner's Province even if the person in possession was not, at the time, a national of the country, an assumption which is by no means indisputable; indeed that is the effect of the decision of the Privy Council in Mayor of Lyons v. East India Company(1). There would appear to have been a clear election by the sovereign authority expressed in its own legislation to waive its rights of confiscation even if they were there (a point we do not decide); and the same consequences followed when the properties in dispute were incorporated into the State of Uttar Pradesh, two days later, on 25th January, 1950. The Privy Council go even further in Mayor of Lyons v. East India Company at page 285 and say that the waiver or relinquishment can be established from the treaty itself.
But however that may be, the fact remains that the titles of these petitioners to the disputed lands had not been repudiated tip to the 26th of January, 1950. It is immaterial whether or not the right of the Dominion Government to do so remained in abeyance till exercised despite the agreement embodied in the (1) I M. I.A. 175 at 274, 275 Instruments of Accession and the legislation and notification quoted above because, in fact, it was not exercised.
Now what was the effect of the non-exercise of those rights ? Even on the English view, the, person in de facto possession is not without rights in the land, nor is he altogether without remedy. It is just a question of the means of redress. In Johnstone v. Pedlar(1) Lord Atkinson, speaking in the House of Lords, said:-
So also in Forester v. Secretary of State for India(9), the Begum, whose estate Government sought to confiscate as an act of State, was only in de facto possession: see page
16. The Privy Council held that the Government had purported to act under colour of a legal title, so its attempt at resumption was not an act of State and consequently could be reviewed in the Courts. Their Lordships thereupon proceeded to investigate the Begum's title, not under the British Government, but as derived from the sovereign power which preceded it (page 18). So also in Mayor of Lyons v. East India Company(3), the title of a foreign alien to land was upheld, not under the English law (because if that had applied there would have been an escheat), but under the law in India derived from non- British sources, that is to say, under the laws of the land before cession. It was held that those laws continued until changed and for that reason a title which would have been bad under the English law was upheld. At page 274 their Lordships say:-
and at page 271 they had already said "In the former case, it is allowed, that the law of the country continues until the Crown, or the Legislature, change it."
Lord Atkinson's view in Johnstone v. Pedlar(1) at page 281 appears to point to the same conclusion. He said: -
We think it is clear on a review of these authorities ,that whichever view be taken, that of the Privy Council and the House of Lords, or that of Chief Justice Marshall, these petitioners, who were in de facto possession of the disputed lands, had rights in them which they could have enforced up to 26th January, 1950, in the Dominion Courts against all persons except possibly the Rulers who granted the land and except possibly the State. We do not by 'any means intend to suggest that they could not have enforced them against the Rulers and the Dominion of India as well, but for reasons which we shall presently disclose it is not necessary to enter into that particular controversy. It is enough for the purposes of this case to hold that the petitioners had, at any rate, the rights defined above. (1) [1921] 2 A. C. 262, (2) (1860) 29 Beav. 300, Now what was the extent of the petitioners' rights? These properties were not State properties in the sense of public buildings and so forth. They were indisputably properties over which the Rulers bad absolute rights of disposition at the date of the grants. The grants are absolute in character and would under any civilised system of, law pass an absolute and indefeasible title to the grantee. Let it be conceded, as was argued (though we do not so decide), that they were defensible at the mere will of a sovereign who held absolute and despotic sway over his subjects in all domestic concerns. The fact remains that up till that time they were neither resumed by the former rulers nor confiscated by the Dominion of India as an act of State. Therefore, up to the 25th of January, 1950, the right and title of the petitioners to continue in possession was good, at any rate, against all but the Rulers and the Dominion of India.
Now what effect did the Constitution have on that? In our opinion, the Constitution, by reason of the authority derived from, and conferred by, the peoples of this land, blotted out in one magnificent sweep all vestiges of arbitrary and despotic power in the territories of India and over its citizens and lands and prohibited just such acts of arbitrary power as the State now seeks to uphold. Let it be conceded (without admitting or deciding the point) that the Dominion of India once had the powers for which the Union Government now contends. The self-same authorities which appear to concede that power also admit that it can be waived or relinquished. What then was the attitude of the Dominion towards those States which it sought to draw into the Republic of India which was yet to be free, sovereign, democratic, as its Constitution later proclaimed it to be? We quote from the mouthpiece of that Government as disclosed in the White Paper on Indian States published by official authority. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's statement (he was then in charge of the States Department) 5th July, 1947, is reproduced at page 157. He said at page 158:-
This invitation was accepted on 19th May, 1949. Page 109 of the White Paper says "As the States came closer to the Centre it became clear that the idea of separate Constitutions being framed for different constituent units of the Indian Union was a legacy from the Rulers' polity which could have no place in a democratic set-up. The matter was, therefore, further discussed by the Ministry of States with the Premiers of Unions and States on May 19, 1949, and it was decided, with their concurrence, that the Constitution of the States should also be framed by the Constituent Assembly of India and should form part of the Constitution of India." It is impossible to think of those who -sat down together
-in the Constituent Assembly, and of those who sent representatives there, as conqueror and conquered, as those who ceded and as those who absorbed, as sovereigns or their plenipotentiaries, contracting alliances and entering into treaties as high contracting parties to an act of State. They were not there as sovereign and subject as citizen and alien, but as the sovereign peoples of India, free democratic equals, forging the pattern of a new life for the common weal. Every vestige of sovereignty was abandoned by the Dominion of India and by the States and surrendered to the peoples of the land who through their representatives in the Constituent Assembly hammered out for themselves a new Constitution in which all were citizens in a new order having but one ie, and owing but one allegiance: devotion, loyalty, idelity, to the Sovereign Democratic Republic that is India. At one stroke all other territorial allegiances were wiped out and the past was obliterated except where expressly preserved; at one moment of time the new order was born with its new allegiance springing from the same source for all, grounded on the same basis: the sovereign will of the, peoples of India with no class, no caste, no race, no creed, no distinction, no reservation.
The Preamble to the Constitution recites in its magnificient prelude-
Article 1(1) sets out that India shall be a Union of States and clauses (2) and (3) define the territories of which India shall be composed. They include the territories in which the disputed lands are situate. Article 5 defines Indian citizens. They include in their wide embrace the Rulers of Charkhari and Sarila who made the grants, the petitioners who received them and those who now seek as an act of State to make the confiscation. It is impossible for a sovereign to exercise an act of State against its own subjects. However disputable the proposition may be. that an act of State can be exercised against a citizen who was once an alien the right being only in abeyance till exercised, there has never been any doubt that it can never be exercised against one who has always been a citizen from the beginning in territory which has from its inception belonged to the State seeking to exercise the right. This is so even on the English authorities which claim far higher rights for the State than other laws seem to allow. Lord Atkinson said in Johnstone v. Pedlar(1) at page 281 :-
Lord Brougham went further in Mayor of Lyon8 v. East India Company(3), and extended the principle to aliens who later became citizens. He said at pages 284 and 285:-
But however that may be, there is no question of conquest or cession here., The new Republic was born on 26th January, 1950, and all derived their rights of citizenship from the same source and from the same moment of time; so also, at the same instant and for the same reason, all territory within its boundaries (1) [19211 2 A.C. 262. (3) 1 M.I.A. 175.
(2) [1892]A A.C. 491.
became the territory of India. There is, as it were from the point of view of the new State, Unity of Possession, Unity of Interest, Unity of Title and Unity of Time. This was also quite clearly the will of the Union Government as expressed in its White Paper, so even if the case was still one of cession there is clear evidence of relinquishment and waiver. At page 115 it is said :-
But we do not found on the will of the Government. We are no longer concerned with principalities, and powers.	Total Judgement
