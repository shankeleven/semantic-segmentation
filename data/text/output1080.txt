State Of Mysore & Anr vs Mysore Spinning & Manufacturing Co on 11 February, 1958	Case Title
JUDGMENT 1958 AIR (SC) 1002 The Judgment was delivered by BOSE, J. :
The learned counsel for the respondents referred to certain observations in Kailash Nath v. State of U.P. 1957 (8) STC 358; 1957 AIR(SC) 790), but that case is not in point because the Court was construing a certain notification which used the words "with a view to export" and it exempted sales made for that purpose from taxation. The language of Article 286(1)
(b) is different and The State of Madras v. Guruviah Naidu 1955 (6) STC 717, at 721; 1956 AIR(SC) 158 at 161) points out that sales made "for the purpose of export" are not protected unless they themselves "occasion the export." It was argued that the present case is distinguishable from the previous decisions because here Government has itself prescribed the course of the export by (1) prohibiting all export from the country save by or through licensed exporters and (2) directing that all goods for export are to be specially packed and specially marked "for export only." It was said that Government has accepted the ratio of the dissenting judgment in The State of Travancore-Cochin v. Shanmugha Vilas Cashew-Nut Factory 1954 SCR 53 at 96; 1953 (4) STC 205) and has placed the starting point of the stream of export one step higher than the majority had done.
It was also urged that the ban that Government placed on export, save through a licensed exporter, left the Mills with no option but to act in the way they did. The answer to that is that the fact that A cannot export while B can (whatever the reason), cannot turn a transaction that would not be an "export" transaction without the ban into one that is just because A is under a disability.The learned High Court Judges held that the sales are exempt because the exporters must "be deemed to be agents of the foreign buyers" and that therefore "the sales to the agents must be presumed to be sales in favour of the principle."
We are at a loss to understand how this fiction can arise. The legislature can, sometimes, introduce a fiction and decree that that which does not in fact exist must be deemed to exist, but the Courts cannot. No Act of the legislature has been called in aid here and, so far as the facts are concerned, they are found, and indeed were admitted by the respondents, to be precisely the reverse. They never claimed that the exporters were their agents and do not set up such a case even in their statement of the case in this Court, except for a sentence where they say that they urged before the Sales Tax Officer that "all exports out of India had to be made only through license export agents."
But that is incorrect. All that they said there was that they were compelled to sell through licensed exporters because they themselves had no license to export. But however that may be, they dropped that case before the Sales Tax Commissioner, if indeed they had ever set it up, and said :-
The Sales Tax Commissioner held that - There is no doubt that the facts are as stated by the company at .......... 3(2) and 3(3) above.
The respondents had an alternative case, namely that even if these sales were not in the course of export, they were sales made in the course of inter-State trade and commerce and so were exempt under Article 286(2)"the following will be substituted :" The respondents had an alternative case, namely, that even if these sales were not in the course of export, they were sales made outside the State of Mysore and so were exempt under Article 286(1)(a)." The remand to the High Court is for final disposal in that court. Each side will bear its own costs in this Court.	Precedent
The second reason is that the right to tax sales is given to the States under entry 54 in List II, therefore, the Centre cannot prevent them form taxing sales that are otherwise taxable either by a Central Act or by rules made under it. Had the States, or one of them, imposed a self-denying restraint on themselves, that would be another matter, for, though they have the power to tax in a certain field, they are not bound to do so and can restrict their rights by legislation as much as they please. But the Centre cannot compel them to do so.
In any event, whether the petitioner company's sales do not fall under Article 286(1)(a) of the Constitution "The High Court said that no finding was necessary on this part of the question. Our remand should have directed the High Court to enquire into this instead of on the question under Article 286(2). The second part of question No. 6 is :"
the sales in question are not affected by the provisions of Article 286(2) of the Constitution.	Section
JUDGMENT 1958 AIR (SC) 1002 The Judgment was delivered by BOSE, J. :
The learned counsel for the respondents referred to certain observations in Kailash Nath v. State of U.P. 1957 (8) STC 358; 1957 AIR(SC) 790), but that case is not in point because the Court was construing a certain notification which used the words "with a view to export" and it exempted sales made for that purpose from taxation. The language of Article 286(1)
(b) is different and The State of Madras v. Guruviah Naidu 1955 (6) STC 717, at 721; 1956 AIR(SC) 158 at 161) points out that sales made "for the purpose of export" are not protected unless they themselves "occasion the export." It was argued that the present case is distinguishable from the previous decisions because here Government has itself prescribed the course of the export by (1) prohibiting all export from the country save by or through licensed exporters and (2) directing that all goods for export are to be specially packed and specially marked "for export only." It was said that Government has accepted the ratio of the dissenting judgment in The State of Travancore-Cochin v. Shanmugha Vilas Cashew-Nut Factory 1954 SCR 53 at 96; 1953 (4) STC 205) and has placed the starting point of the stream of export one step higher than the majority had done.
We are unable to accept this contention for two reasons. The first is that even without the Government order the ordinary course of export would take the same procedure and therefore the compulsion of the Government order makes no difference. These sales cannot, under any view, be said to have "occasioned the export."
The second reason is that the right to tax sales is given to the States under entry 54 in List II, therefore, the Centre cannot prevent them form taxing sales that are otherwise taxable either by a Central Act or by rules made under it. Had the States, or one of them, imposed a self-denying restraint on themselves, that would be another matter, for, though they have the power to tax in a certain field, they are not bound to do so and can restrict their rights by legislation as much as they please. But the Centre cannot compel them to do so.
It was also urged that the ban that Government placed on export, save through a licensed exporter, left the Mills with no option but to act in the way they did.
