As we have already indicated the conclusion of the tribunal on this point is based on the observations of this Court in the case of Banaras Ice Factory Ltd. v. Its Workmen (1). It will, therefore, be necessary to examine those observations and decide whether they really justify the conclusion of the tribunal. In that case this Court was dealing with the decision of the Labour Appellate Tribunal on a complaint filed before it under s. 22 of the Industrial 'Disputes (Appellate Tribunal) Act (Act No. XLVIII of 1950), hereafter called the Act. It appears that during the pendency of an appeal before the Labour Appellate Tribunal the appellant Company decided to close down its business and gave notice to all the workmen that their services would be terminated upon the expiry of 30 days from July 16, 1952. That led to the complaint under s. 23 of the Act on the allegation that s. 22 of the said Act had been contravened. The Labour Appellate Tribunal had found that the closure was bona fide. It conceded that the appellant had the right to close its business for bona fide reasons; but nevertheless it took the view that permission should have been obtained before the said closure. That is why according to it the appellant was guilty of contra-
(1) (1957] S.C.R. 143.
vening s. 22(b) of the Act. This decision was reversed by this Court. In doing so, the true scope and effect of ss. 22 and 23 of the Act were considered and it was held that if the impugned closure was bona fide then neither of the two sections came into operation. Thus the position was that the closure was bona fide and that the appellant had committed no breach of s. 22(b) of the Act. In dealing with the scope and effect of s. 23 this Court observed: "There is hardly any occasion for praying for permission to lift the ban imposed by s. 22, when the employer has the right to close his business and bona fide does so, with the result that the industry itself ceases to exist ". Then it was added: " If there is no real closure but a mere pretence of a closure or it is mala fide, there is no closure in the eye of the law and the workmen can raise an industrial dispute and may even claim under s. 23 of the Act". It is on this latter observation that the Tribunal has founded its decision. With respect we do not read the observations as laying down an. unqualified and categorical proposition of law that wherever a closure is mala fide it must be deemed to be unreal and non-existent. What this Court has said is that in cases of pretence of closure no closure in fact has taken place and for the purpose of s. 23 of the Act with which the Court was dealing a mala fide closure may conceivably be treated as falling in the same class as a pretence of closure. But in the present case the facts are not in dispute. There has been a closure and the agencies have been closed and their business has been wound up. If it is found that the closure was not bona fide the consequences would be the liability of the employer to pay the higher compensation under s. 25-FFF of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. But it is difficult to see how when the two agencies have in fact been closed the finding about mala fides can justify the conclusion that the said two agencies should be deemed to continue and how the award can make an order on that basis. Besides, as we have already indicated even the finding about the mala fides of the closure is itself open to serious doubt. In our opinion the said finding is based on mere surmises and is entirely opposed to the weight of evidence adduced in this case.	Precedent
The result is that portion of the award which issues directions to the appellant on the basis that the closure, in the eyes of law, had not taken place is set aside. The appeal succeeds to that extent and must be allowed. There will be no order as to costs in the circumstances. Appeal allowed.	Conclusion
CIVIL APPELLATE, JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal No. 169 of 1959.
Appeal by special leave from the Award dated June 26, 1958, of the Industrial Tribunal, Orissa, at Cuttack in Reference No. 2 of 1957.

1960. March 9. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by GAJENDRAGADKAR, J.-This appeal by special leave arises from an industrial dispute between the appellant, the Tea Districts Labour Association, and the respondents the ex- employees of the appellant and another. The dispute which was referred to the industrial tribunal for its adjudication consisted of two items:,,(a) Whether the retrenchment of ten workers of Koraput and Ganjam Agencies of Tea Districts Labour Association effected on the 30th November, 1956, was justified, if not, to what relief those workers are entitled?
(b)Whether the closure of the Koraput and Ganjam Agencies contemplated by Messrs. Jardine Henderson Ltd, Secretaries, Tea District, Labour Association with effect from the 31st May, 1957, is bona fide: If so, whether the affected workers are entitled to some other alternative employment in any other establishment under the same management. If not bona fide, to what relief those workers are entitled ? "
that even if the closure may not be bona fide it does not follow that the closure in fact has not taken place. It is not a case where closure is a pretence or the plea of closure is unreal in the sense that having purported to close the agencies, the same agencies have been functioning all the time, under a different garb. In fact the agencies have been closed even according to the finding of the tribunal. It is contended that the finding about the mala fides of the closure is open to serious doubt because the said finding is not supported by any legal evidence, and in a sense is opposed to the weight of the evidence on the record. We are inclined to think that there is considerable force in this contention. But assuming that the closure is not shown to be bonafide, does it necessarily follow that the closure is a fiction and it is unreal in the sense that the agencies can be treated to be in existence in the eye of the law ? That is the very narrow point which arises for our decision in the present appeal.
As we have already indicated the conclusion of the tribunal on this point is based on the observations of this Court in the case of Banaras Ice Factory Ltd. v. Its Workmen (1). It will, therefore, be necessary to examine those observations and decide whether they really justify the conclusion of the tribunal. In that case this Court was dealing with the decision of the Labour Appellate Tribunal on a complaint filed before it under s. 22 of the Industrial 'Disputes (Appellate Tribunal) Act (Act No. XLVIII of 1950), hereafter called the Act.

That is why according to it the appellant was guilty of contra-

vening s. 22(b) of the Act. This decision was reversed by this Court. In doing so, the true scope and effect of ss. 22 and 23 of the Act were considered and it was held that if the impugned closure was bona fide then neither of the two sections came into operation. Thus the position was that the closure was bona fide and that the appellant had committed no breach of s. 22(b) of the Act. In dealing with the scope and effect of s. 23 this Court observed: "There is hardly any occasion for praying for permission to lift the ban imposed by s. 22, when the employer has the right to close his business and bona fide does so, with the result that the industry itself ceases to exist ". Then it was added: " If there is no real closure but a mere pretence of a closure or it is mala fide, there is no closure in the eye of the law and the workmen can raise an industrial dispute and may even claim under s. 23 of the Act". It is on this latter observation that the Tribunal has founded its decision. With respect we do not read the observations as laying down an. unqualified and categorical proposition of law that wherever a closure is mala fide it must be deemed to be unreal and non-existent. What this Court has said is that in cases of pretence of closure no closure in fact has taken place and for the purpose of s. 23 of the Act with which the Court was dealing a mala fide closure may conceivably be treated as falling in the same class as a pretence of closure. But in the present case the facts are not in dispute. There has been a closure and the agencies have been closed and their business has been wound up.
