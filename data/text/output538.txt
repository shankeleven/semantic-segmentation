Narain Swadeshi Weaving Mills vs The Commissioner Of Excessprofits Tax on 23 October, 1954	Case Title
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 145 of 1953. Appeal by Special Leave from the Judgment and Order dated the 8th day of September, 1950, of the High Court of Judicature for the State of Punjab at Simla in Civil Reference No. 3 of 1949.
M. C. Setalvad, Attorney-General for India, (G. N. Joshi and P. G. Gokhale, with him) for the respondent. 1954. October 25. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS J.-This appeal by special leave arises out of a consolidated reference made on the 19th April, 1949, under section 66(1) of the Indian Income-tax Act read with section 21 of the Excess Profits Tax Act by the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal, Madras Bench. The reference arose out of four several proceedings for assessment to excess profits tax of the appellant, the chargeable accounting periods being periods ending with 31st March of each of the years 1942, 1943, 1944 and 1945.
(2) Whether the share of income of Dr. Surmukh Singh, a partner in the selling agency of Ram Singh & ,Co., could be included under section 10 A in the excess profits tax assessment of the assessee firm ?
(4) Whether proper opportunity under section 10 A had been given to the assessee firm?"
Act applied section 1O A could not be invoked by the revenue and, therefore, the question whether there was "evidence to support the finding of the Tribunal under that section could not arise. On the contrary, the further question of law which would really arise out of the order of the Appellate Tribunal consequent upon the aforesaid answer to question No. 3 would be whether under the facts and circumstances of the case the application of section 1O A with a view to amalgamating the income of the firms Uppal & Co., and Ram Singh & Co., with the income of the assessee firm was correct and valid in law and that was precisely the first question which the assessee firm sought to raise by its application. In our view the High Court should not only have answered question No. 3 in the negative but should also have raised, as a corollary to that answer to question No. 3, the further question of law on the lines indicated in question No. I of the assessee's petition. In other words, the High Court should have, after answering question No. 3 in the negative reframed the referred question No. I by restoring question No. 1 as suggested by the assessee firm in its petition and should have answered the question so restored in the negative and in favour of the assessee. For the reasons stated above, we allow this appeal, reframe question No. I by restoring the first question suggested by the assessee firm, namely-	Issue

The learned counsel appearing for the assessee firm submitted before the High Court that the third of the referred questions should be discussed and decided first, but the High Court took the view that the decision of the first question was a necessary preliminary to the consideration of the third question. Taking up, then, the first question first the High Court referred to the ,several facts found by the Appellate Tribunal and described as steps and regarding them as circumstantial evidence came to the conclusion that it could not be said that there was no evidence upon which the Tribunal was justified in coming to the conclusion that the formation of the firms, Uppal & Co., and Ram Singh & Co., was mainly for the purpose of avoidance or reduction of liability to excess profits tax. In the result, the High Court held that the three firms, the assessee firm, Uppal & Co., and Ram Singh & Co., were in fact one and the same and on that basis proceeded next to take up the third question. After referring to section 2(5) and certain judicial decisions, the High Court concluded as follows:-	PetArg
isolated transaction has been held to be conceivably capable of falling within the definition of business as -'being an adventure in the nature of trade provided the transaction bears clear indicia of trade. The question therefore, whether a particular source of income is business or not must be decided according to our am ordinary notions as to what a business is. The case of Commissioner of Excess Profits Tax, Bombay City v.Shri Lakshmi Silk Mills Ltd.(1), decided by this Court is clearly distinguishable. There, the respondent company which was formed for the purpose of manufacturing silk cloth installed a plant for dying silk yarn as a part of its business. During the relevant chargeable accounting period, owing to difficulty in obtaining silk yarn on account of the war, it could not make any use of this plant and it remained idle for some time. In August, 1943, the plant was let out to another company on a monthly rent. The question arose whether the income received by, the respondent company in the chargeable accounting period by way of rent was income from business and assessable to excess profits tax. It should be noted that in that case the respondent company was continuing its business of manufacturing silk cloth. Only a part of its business, namely, that of dying silk yarn had to be temporarily stopped owing to the difficulty in obtaining silk yarn on account of the war. In such a situation, this Court held that part of the assets did not cease to be commercial assets of that business since it was temporarily put to different use or let out to another and accordingly the income from the assets would be profits of the business irrespective of the manner in which that asset was exploited by the company. This Court clearly indicated that no general principle could be laid down which would be applicable to all cases and that each case must be decided on its own circumstances according to ordinary common sense principles. In the case before us the assessee firm's business had entirely closed. It no longer 'manufactured any ribbons and laces. It had accordingly no further trading or commercial activity.It could not in fact use the plant, machinery, etc., (1) [1952] S.C.R. 1.
after the land and the buildings where they were installed had been sold to the company. In these circumstances the assessee firm let out the plant, machinery, etc., on an annual rent of Rs. 40,000. These facts are very similar to those found in Inland. Revenue , Commissioners v. Broadway Car Co., Ltd.(1). There the war conditions bad reduced the company's business to very small proportions. In that situation it was observed that in that case the company dealt with part of its property which bad become redundant and was sublet purely to produce incomes transaction quite apart from the ordinary business activities of the company. The ratio decides in that case which was noticed in the judgment of this Court appears to us to apply to the facts found in the present case apart from the findings Under section 10 A. Applying also the common sense principle to the fact so found it is impossible to hold that the letting out of the plant, machinery, etc., was at all a business operation when its normal business activity had come to a close. It is interesting to note that sub-sections (3) and (4) of section 12 of the Indian Income-tax Act recognise that letting out of plant, machinery, etc., may be a source of income falling under the head "other sources" within that section and not necessarily under the head "business" dealt with in section 10 of that Act. In the facts and circumstances of this case, therefore, the letting out of the plant, machinery, etc.,cannot be held to fall within the body of the definition of "business" under section 2(5) of the Excess Profits Tax Act. In this view of the matter it is not necessary for us to express an opinion as to the meaning or implication of the proviso to that definition or rule 4(4) of Schedule I to the Act. In our opinion, in the facts and circumstances of this case, question No. 3 should have been answered in the negative.	Precedent
and "Ram Singh & Co.," could be amalgamated with the income of the assessee firm under the provisions of section 10 A of the Excess Profits Tax Act ?
(3) Whether the lease money obtained by the assessee firm could be legally treated as business profits liable to excess profits tax ?
The learned counsel appearing for the assessee firm has submitted before us-and we think rightly-that the approach of the High Court was erroneous in that they took up the discussion of question No. I first. That question, as framed, proceeded on the assumption that section 1O A applied to the case and only raised the question as to whether there was any evidence to support the finding of the Appellate Tribunal arrived at as a result of the enquiry -under that section, namely, that the main purpose of the transaction was the avoidance of excess profits tax. The long title and the preamble of the Excess Profits Tax Act refer to the imposition of tax on excess profits arising out of certain businesses. Section 4, which is the charging section and section 5 which lays down the application of the Act to certain business, clearly postulate the existence of a business carried on by the assessee on the profits of which the excess profits tax can be imposed. Therefore, if there is such a business during the relevant period, then and then alone can arise the question of the applicability of section 10 A. If there is no such business as is contemplated by the Act, then the Act does not apply and section 10 A cannot come into operation at all. Before the Excess Profits Tax Officer can embark upon an enquiry as to whether a transaction was effected for the avoidance or reduction of liability to excess profits tax and to make such adjustments as he considers appropriate_ there must be proof that the assessee was, during the chargeable accounting period, carrying on any business of the kind referred to in section 5 of the Act. Logically, therefore, the Appellate Tribunal as well as the High Court should have taken up question No. 3 first, for on a decision of that question would depend the applicability of section 1O A and if that question were answered in favour of the assessee firm the further question of law as raised in question No. I would not, in such event, arise. The approach of the High Court was, therefore, logically misconceived on the facts of this case.
What then are the facts found by the Appellate Tribunal apart from its findings under section 10 A ? The findings are that after the formation of the company the assessee firm was left with no business at all. The company purchased the leasehold rights in the lands and buildings where the plant, machinery, etc., were installed. The firm as such ceased to manufacture any ribbons and laces. It was left with the plant, machinery, etc., which it did not require and which ceased to be a commercial asset in its hands, for it had no longer any manufacturing business at all. Further, the assessee firm had put it out of its power to use the plant, machinery, etc., for it had no right in the lands and buildings where the plant, machinery, etc., had been installed. In these circumstances, the assessee firm let out the plant, machinery, etc., to the company. It was thenceforth the company which was carrying on the business of manufacturing ribbons and laces and for that purpose hired the plant, machinery, etc., from the assesee firm. Prima facie it was the company which appointed the managing agents and the selling agents. Ex facie and apart from the alleged result of any enquiry under section 10 or section 1O A of the Excess Profits Tax Act those were not transactions of the assessee firm. The assessee firm was, therefore, left only with some property which at one time was a commercial asset but had ceased to be so. The assessee firm thereupon let out that property on rent. The question is whether such letting out in such circumstances amounted to carrying on of a business.
The question of law raised in the third question being answered in favour of the assessee firm, the question of the applicability of section 1O A of the Excess Profits Tax Act could not arise, for the assessee firm having, during the relevant period, no business to which that (1) [1946] 2 A.E.R. 609.	Section
The High Court accordingly answered the third question in the affirmative and against the assessee firm. The necessary certificate of fitness for appeal to this Court having been refused by the High Court, the assessee firm obtained special leave of this Court to prefer the present appeal.
and we answer the question so reframed in the negative. Question No. 2 must be answered in the negative and in favour of the assessee by way of necessary corollary. We also answer question No. 3 in the negative. The appellant will be entitled to the costs of this appeal and we order accordingly.
