Thakur Kesari Singh vs The State Of Rajasthan And Others on 19 October, 1960	Case Title
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 277 of 1955. Appeal from the judgment and order dated April 27, 1954, of the Rajasthan High Court in Civil Mis. Writ No. 1/1954. N. C. Chatterjee, Suresh Agarwal and Ganpat Rai, for the appellant.	Issue
R.K. Rastogi and K. L. Mehta, for the respondents. 1960. October 19. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by IMAM J.-The appellant was the Jagirdar of Thikana Rakhi in the Marwar (Jodhpur) area of the State of Rajasthan. Within Thikana Rakhi was the village of Khakharki. He had a number of tenants under him in the village who paid rent on the basis of a certain share of the produce of the land held.
On October 31, 1950, the appellant who had some difficulty in realising the rent from his tenants in village Khakharki, made an application under s. 78 of the Tenancy Act to the Tahsildar, Merta, within which the village Khakharki was situate. Before this application was finally disposed of, the Government of Rajasthan issued a Notification under s. 85 of the Tenancy Act which is set out below:
Fortythree of the tenants filed a petition in the High Court for Rajasthan for a writ of certiorari to quash the orders of the Collector, the Additional Commissioner and the Revenue Board, earlier mentioned. The High Court allowed the petition and quashed and set aside these orders and held that the Notification under s. 85 of the Tenancy Act having been cancelled, no further proceedings for realisation of arrears of rent as arrears of land revenue could be taken by the Collector of Nagaur. The High Court however granted a certificate that the case was a fit one for appeal to the Supreme Court. Hence the present appeal. The rent found due has not been realised yet by the Tahsildar presumably, in view of the pending proceedings. The respondents to the appeal are the State of Rajasthan and various Revenue Officers of that State and the tenants. This appeal has been contested only by some of the tenants and the other respondents have not appeared before us. Section 85 of the Tenancy Act is in these terms:	Facts
The first point raised on behalf of the respondents in the High Court was that s. 85 of the Tenancy Act had itself been repealed by the Revenue Courts Act and no action under that section could be taken after the latter Act had come into force.	RespArg
There was an Act in force in the Marwar area called the Marwar Tenancy Act of 1949, hereafter refer. red to as the Tenancy Act, which had been passed by His Highness the Maharaja of Jodhpur before the integration of the State of Jodhpur in the State of Rajasthan. That Act now stands repealed but we are concerned with a period when it was in force. Section 78 of that Act provides that when rent is payable by a division of the produce or is based on an estimate or appraisement of the standing crop, the landlord or the tenant may apply to the Tahsildar for making the division, estimate or appraisement, when this could not be done amicably. Section 79 of the Tenancy Act lays down the procedure to be followed at the hearing of such an application and provides that any amount found due as rent by the Tahsildar on that application shall have the effect of a decree for arrears of rent.
The Revenue Courts Act was repealed in 1955 after the judgment of the High Court was delivered but this does not affect the question before us. The long title of the Act states that the Act is intended to provide for and regulate the jurisdiction and procedure of Revenue Courts and Officers, in Rajasthan. The preamble states " Whereas it is expedient, pending the enactment of a comprehensive law for the whole of Rajasthan relating to agricultural tenancy, land tenures, revenue, rent, survey, record, settlement and other matters connected with land, to provide for and regulate the jurisdiction and procedure of revenue courts and officers in relation to such matters arising under the laws in force in the covenanting States of Rajasthan ". Jodhpur was one of the covenanting States and one of the laws in force there, was the Tenancy Act. This Act continued to apply to the territories belonging to the former Jodhpur State which since the integration, formed part of the State of Rajasthan, till that Act was repealed as hereinbefore stated. Section 2 of the Act provides, " On and from the coming into force of this Act all existing laws shall, in so far as they relate to matters dealt with in this Act, be repealed ". It is said that the effect of s. 2 of the Revenue Courts Act is to repeal s. 85 of the Tenancy Act. The High Court was, unable to accept this contention and we think rightly. Section 85 of the Tenancy Act would be repealed only if the Revenue Courts Act contained any provision dealing with the matter covered by it. We find no such provision in the Revenue Courts Act, The Revenue Courts Act deals with matters of jurisdiction and procedure of Revenue Courts. It does not deal with any substantive right. This is clear from the provisions of the Revenue Courts Act and, indeed, is not in dispute. Quite clearly, s. 85 creates, on the requisite notification being issued, a substantive right in a landlord to have the rent due to him recovered as arrears of land revenue. We do not find any provision in the Revenue Courts Act dealing with the substantive right created by s. 85 of the Tenancy Act. There is, therefore, no foundation for the argument that that section has been repealed by s. 2 of the Revenue Courts Act.
A reference to schedule 1 to Revenue Courts Act which gives a list of suits and applications triable by a Revenue Court and prescribes the periods of limitation applicable to and court fees payable on them can usefully be made now. The schedule is divided into several groups, of which group C contains a list of applications triable by a Collector. Item 2 of this group concerns applications " for realisation of rent as land revenue on the general refusal to pay rent ". In regard to the period of limitation for such applica- tions, it is stated there that none exists. We have no doubt that item 2 of group C in the schedule does not confer a substantive right to make an application for realisation of rent as land revenue at all. The purpose of the schedule appears from ss. 7, 9 and 10 of the Act which respectively provide that the jurisdiction of the various revenue courts, the periods of limitation for proceedings maintainable in these Courts and the court fees payable thereon are as stated in the schedule. The schedule is not operative by itself So item 2 of group C in the schedule does not confer any right to apply for collection of rent as arrears of land revenue. On the other hand, the mention of such an application in the schedule clearly indicates that the Revenue Courts Act recognises that such an application is competent. Since the Revenue Courts Act itself does not authorise such an application, it must be so competent under other existing laws, reference to which has been made in the preamble and s. 2 of the Act. One of such laws is s. 85 of the Tenancy Act. Therefore it seems to us that the Revenue Courts Act, instead of repealing s. 85 of the Tenancy Act contemplates its continuance in force.
It is necessary before leaving this part of the case to refer to Ch. XIII of the Tenancy Act which deals with procedure and jurisdiction. It consists of ss. 118 to 144. Section 118 says that all suits and applications of the nature specified in the second schedule to the Act shall be heard and determined by a Revenue Court. Section 124 states that all suits and other proceedings especified in the second schedule shall be instituted within the time prescribed for them in that schedule. Section 129 provides that a Deputy Commissioner shall have power to dispose of applications specified in group E of the second schedule. It is not necessary to refer to the other sections in this Chapter. Turning to second schedule, we find that group E is concerned with applications triable by a Deputy Commissioner. Item 4 of this group deals with applications under s. 85 " for collection of rent as land revenue in the event of general refusal to pay ". The period of limitation for such applications is stated there to be "
There is no reference anywhere to the currency of the notification in point of time. Item 4 of group E in schedule 11 to the Tenancy Act earlier referred to, leads to the same conclusion. That item provides that the period of limitation for an application under s. 85 is so long as notification remains in force. It is clear that if in sub-sec. (2) the words ',in any local area to which a notification applies "
was held that further proceedings under a temporary Act could not be continued after it had expired. It is contended that s. 85 of the Tenancy Act was really a temporary Act for it was brought into operation only upon a notification which notification was clearly not intended to be of permanent operation. We are unable to accept this view. The fact, if this be so, that s. 85 is brought into operation by a notification, and that that notification may not be of permanent operation, does not make the section a temporary enactment. We do not think that the principles applicable to interpretation_ of temporary Acts apply to the case of a provision like s. 85 of the Tenancy Act. reliance is also placed on cl.(a) of sub-sec. (4) of s.85 of the Tenancy Act. It is said that this clause by permitting suits for recovery of rents which have not been recovered under the section, indicates that after the rescission of the Notification, further proceedings cannot be taken under the section. It is contended that cl. (a) contemplates that it may so happen that when a notification is rescinded, the whole amount of rent in respect of which the application under s. 85 had been made, had not been recovered and that cl. (a) permits suit to be filed in respect of the amount which remained unrealised at the date the notification is rescinded. This argument seems to us to beg the question, for, it proceeds on the basis that the suit contemplated by el. (a) is for the amount of rent which cannot be recovered under the section any more because of the rescission of the notification. Clause (a) however may clearly apply to a case where in spite of a notification under the section, the landlord whether during its currency or later, chooses to proceed by way of a suit under the other provisions of the Tenancy Act.

CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 277 of 1955. Appeal from the judgment and order dated April 27, 1954, of the Rajasthan High Court in Civil Mis. Writ No. 1/1954. N. C. Chatterjee, Suresh Agarwal and Ganpat Rai, for the appellant.
R.K. Rastogi and K. L. Mehta, for the respondents. 1960. October 19. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by IMAM J.-The appellant was the Jagirdar of Thikana Rakhi in the Marwar (Jodhpur) area of the State of Rajasthan. Within Thikana Rakhi was the village of Khakharki. He had a number of tenants under him in the village who paid rent on the basis of a certain share of the produce of the land held.
There was an Act in force in the Marwar area called the Marwar Tenancy Act of 1949, hereafter refer. red to as the Tenancy Act, which had been passed by His Highness the Maharaja of Jodhpur before the integration of the State of Jodhpur in the State of Rajasthan.

Section 79 of the Tenancy Act lays down the procedure to be followed at the hearing of such an application and provides that any amount found due as rent by the Tahsildar on that application shall have the effect of a decree for arrears of rent.
On October 31, 1950, the appellant who had some difficulty in realising the rent from his tenants in village Khakharki, made an application under s. 78 of the Tenancy Act to the Tahsildar, Merta, within which the village Khakharki was situate. Before this application was finally disposed of, the Government of Rajasthan issued a Notification under s. 85 of the Tenancy Act which is set out below:
Fortythree of the tenants filed a petition in the High Court for Rajasthan for a writ of certiorari to quash the orders of the Collector, the Additional Commissioner and the Revenue Board, earlier mentioned. The High Court allowed the petition and quashed and set aside these orders and held that the Notification under s. 85 of the Tenancy Act having been cancelled, no further proceedings for realisation of arrears of rent as arrears of land revenue could be taken by the Collector of Nagaur. The High Court however granted a certificate that the case was a fit one for appeal to the Supreme Court. Hence the present appeal. The rent found due has not been realised yet by the Tahsildar presumably, in view of the pending proceedings. The respondents to the appeal are the State of Rajasthan and various Revenue Officers of that State and the tenants. This appeal has been contested only by some of the tenants and the other respondents have not appeared before us. Section 85 of the Tenancy Act is in these terms:
The first point raised on behalf of the respondents in the High Court was that s. 85 of the Tenancy Act had itself been repealed by the Revenue Courts Act and no action under that section could be taken after the latter Act had come into force.
The Revenue Courts Act was repealed in 1955 after the judgment of the High Court was delivered but this does not affect the question before us. The long title of the Act states that the Act is intended to provide for and regulate the jurisdiction and procedure of Revenue Courts and Officers, in Rajasthan. The preamble states " Whereas it is expedient, pending the enactment of a comprehensive law for the whole of Rajasthan relating to agricultural tenancy, land tenures, revenue, rent, survey, record, settlement and other matters connected with land, to provide for and regulate the jurisdiction and procedure of revenue courts and officers in relation to such matters arising under the laws in force in the covenanting States of Rajasthan ". Jodhpur was one of the covenanting States and one of the laws in force there, was the Tenancy Act. This Act continued to apply to the territories belonging to the former Jodhpur State which since the integration, formed part of the State of Rajasthan, till that Act was repealed as hereinbefore stated. Section 2 of the Act provides, " On and from the coming into force of this Act all existing laws shall, in so far as they relate to matters dealt with in this Act, be repealed ". It is said that the effect of s. 2 of the Revenue Courts Act is to repeal s. 85 of the Tenancy Act. The High Court was, unable to accept this contention and we think rightly. Section 85 of the Tenancy Act would be repealed only if the Revenue Courts Act contained any provision dealing with the matter covered by it. We find no such provision in the Revenue Courts Act, The Revenue Courts Act deals with matters of jurisdiction and procedure of Revenue Courts. It does not deal with any substantive right. This is clear from the provisions of the Revenue Courts Act and, indeed, is not in dispute. Quite clearly, s. 85 creates, on the requisite notification being issued, a substantive right in a landlord to have the rent due to him recovered as arrears of land revenue. We do not find any provision in the Revenue Courts Act dealing with the substantive right created by s. 85 of the Tenancy Act. There is, therefore, no foundation for the argument that that section has been repealed by s. 2 of the Revenue Courts Act.
A reference to schedule 1 to Revenue Courts Act which gives a list of suits and applications triable by a Revenue Court and prescribes the periods of limitation applicable to and court fees payable on them can usefully be made now. The schedule is divided into several groups, of which group C contains a list of applications triable by a Collector. Item 2 of this group concerns applications " for realisation of rent as land revenue on the general refusal to pay rent ". In regard to the period of limitation for such applica- tions, it is stated there that none exists. We have no doubt that item 2 of group C in the schedule does not confer a substantive right to make an application for realisation of rent as land revenue at all. The purpose of the schedule appears from ss. 7, 9 and 10 of the Act which respectively provide that the jurisdiction of the various revenue courts, the periods of limitation for proceedings maintainable in these Courts and the court fees payable thereon are as stated in the schedule. The schedule is not operative by itself So item 2 of group C in the schedule does not confer any right to apply for collection of rent as arrears of land revenue. On the other hand, the mention of such an application in the schedule clearly indicates that the Revenue Courts Act recognises that such an application is competent. Since the Revenue Courts Act itself does not authorise such an application, it must be so competent under other existing laws, reference to which has been made in the preamble and s. 2 of the Act. One of such laws is s. 85 of the Tenancy Act. Therefore it seems to us that the Revenue Courts Act, instead of repealing s. 85 of the Tenancy Act contemplates its continuance in force.
It is necessary before leaving this part of the case to refer to Ch. XIII of the Tenancy Act which deals with procedure and jurisdiction. It consists of ss. 118 to 144. Section 118 says that all suits and applications of the nature specified in the second schedule to the Act shall be heard and determined by a Revenue Court. Section 124 states that all suits and other proceedings especified in the second schedule shall be instituted within the time prescribed for them in that schedule. Section 129 provides that a Deputy Commissioner shall have power to dispose of applications specified in group E of the second schedule. It is not necessary to refer to the other sections in this Chapter. Turning to second schedule, we find that group E is concerned with applications triable by a Deputy Commissioner. Item 4 of this group deals with applications under s. 85 " for collection of rent as land revenue in the event of general refusal to pay ". The period of limitation for such applications is stated there to be "
There is no reference anywhere to the currency of the notification in point of time. Item 4 of group E in schedule 11 to the Tenancy Act earlier referred to, leads to the same conclusion. That item provides that the period of limitation for an application under s. 85 is so long as notification remains in force. It is clear that if in sub-sec. (2) the words ',in any local area to which a notification applies "
was held that further proceedings under a temporary Act could not be continued after it had expired. It is contended that s. 85 of the Tenancy Act was really a temporary Act for it was brought into operation only upon a notification which notification was clearly not intended to be of permanent operation. We are unable to accept this view. The fact, if this be so, that s. 85 is brought into operation by a notification, and that that notification may not be of permanent operation, does not make the section a temporary enactment. We do not think that the principles applicable to interpretation_ of temporary Acts apply to the case of a provision like s. 85 of the Tenancy Act. reliance is also placed on cl.(a) of sub-sec. (4) of s.85 of the Tenancy Act. It is said that this clause by permitting suits for recovery of rents which have not been recovered under the section, indicates that after the rescission of the Notification, further proceedings cannot be taken under the section. It is contended that cl. (a) contemplates that it may so happen that when a notification is rescinded, the whole amount of rent in respect of which the application under s. 85 had been made, had not been recovered and that cl. (a) permits suit to be filed in respect of the amount which remained unrealised at the date the notification is rescinded. This argument seems to us to beg the question, for, it proceeds on the basis that the suit contemplated by el. (a) is for the amount of rent which cannot be recovered under the section any more because of the rescission of the notification. Clause (a) however may clearly apply to a case where in spite of a notification under the section, the landlord whether during its currency or later, chooses to proceed by way of a suit under the other provisions of the Tenancy Act.
It is then contended on behalf of the tenants that the Notification of February 22, 1951, was not a valid notification because out of 125 tenants in village Khakharki 82 had paid rent and the remaining 43, who are the respondents in this appeal, were willing to pay but could not pay as the appellant was asking for larger sums than what were legitimately due to him. It is contended that on these facts it could not be said that there was a general refusal to pay rent within the meaning of s. 85 of the Tenancy Act. Hence, it is said that the Notification was ultra vires the section and inoperative. We do not think that the tenants can be allowed to raise this point in this Court. It does not appear to have been raised in the High Court. The High Court's judgment makes no mention of it. Whether it is open for a Court to go behind the notification issued under s. 85 and decide its validity or not, this contention of the tenants raises a question of fact as to how many tenants had refused to pay rent. It also raises a question of interpretation of the words "general refusal to pay " in s. 85. None of these questions was raised at any earlier stage. We are therefore, not inclined to allow the tenants to raise them now.
In the result we allow the appeal with costs here and below. Appeal allowed.	Total Judgement
