Narendra Kumar And Others vs The Union Of India And Others on 3 December, 1959	Case Title
ORIGINAL JURISDICTION :Petition No. 85 of 1958. Petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India for enforcement of Fundamental Rights.	Issue
1959. December 3. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS GUPTAJ.-The three persons who have filed this petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution for enforcement of their fundamental rights conferred by Art. 14, Art. 19(1)(f) and Art. 19(1)(g) thereof are dealers in imported copper and carry on their business at Jagadhri in the State of Punjab. On different dates prior to April 3, 1958, they entered into contracts of purchase of copper with importers at Bombay and Calcutta. Before, however, they could take delivery from the importers the Government of India issued on April 2, 1958, an order called the " Non-ferrous Metal Control Order, 1958 " hereafter referred to as " the order " in exercise of its powers under s. 3 of the Essential Commodities Act (Act X of 1955)-referred to hereafter as " the Act ". In this order " non-ferrous metal " was defined to mean " imported copper, lead, tin and zinc in any of the forms specified in the Schedule of the order." The Order was from the very beginning made applicable to imported copper. The price was controlled by cl. 3 of the Order which provides in its first sub-clause that " no person shall sell or offer to sell any non-ferrous metal at a price which exceeds the amount represented by an addition of 3 1/2% to its landed cost,"	Facts

but if heavy imports are reported the Controller shall have the discretion to issue stocks in larger quantities." The position immediately on the issue of the Order on April 2, 1958, thus was that no person could buy or sell imported copper at a price above the landed Cost plus 31/2% thereof and that no person could acquire or agree to acquire such copper except under a permit issued by the Controller. In issuing such permits the Controller was to be governed by such principles as the Central Government would specify. After the principles were specified in the letter of the 18th of April, the Controller could no longer issue any permit to a dealer and could issue permits only to certain. manufacturers as indicated in paras. 1 and 2 of the letter. In view of the requirement of cl. 4 of the Order the petitioners applied on April 14, 1958, for permits to enable them to take delivery of the copper in respect of which they had entered into contracts with different parties. Though no formal order appears to have been passed on these applications, it is not disputed that the applications for permits were refused and no permits were issued to these petitioners. The main contention of the petitioners is two- fold. First, it is said that cl. 4 of the Order read with the principles specified in the letter of the 18th April violates the right conferred on them as citizens of India by Art. 19(1)(f) of the Constitution of India to acquire pro- perty and also the right conferred by Article 19(1)(g) to carry on trade, that these violations are not within the saving provisions of Art. 19(5) and 19(6) of the Constitution and therefore are void. Secondly, it is said that the fixation of the price at the landed cost plus 31 % as the maximum also abridge the rights conferred on them by Arts. 19(1)(f) and 19(1)(g) of the Constitution and that this also is not saved by the provisions in Arts. 19(5) and 19(6) and so are void. A further contention is that the principles specified being discriminatory in nature as between the manufacturers and dealers in copper have resulted in violating the right to equal protection of laws to the petitioners and thus infringe the right guranteed by Art. 14 of the Constitution. As regards the principles specified in the letter of the 18th April it wag further contended that as they form an integral part of the " Order " by which alone the Central Government can regulate the distribution and supply of essential commodities under s. 3 of the Act it was necessary for them to be notified in the Official Gazette as required by its 5th sub-section and to be laid before both Houses of Parliament as required by its 6th sub- section and as these requirements were not fulfilled, the principles have no legal force. Alternatively, it was contended that if the principles are considered not to form part of the order made by the Central Government the regulation in so far as it was by these principles, was outside the Act as s. 3 empowers the Central, Government to provide for regulating or prohibiting the production and supply of essential commodities and trade and commerce in essential commodities by an order only and not otherwise. The petitioners pray for an appropriate writ or order or direction (1) restraining the respondents, the Union of India, the Chief Industrial Adviser to the Government of India and the Development Officer, Ministry of Industry from enforcing cls. 3 and 4 of the order; (2) to quashing the order of the Development Officer rejecting the petitioners' application for grant of permit by a direction to the 2nd and 3rd respondents to grant the applications for permits and (3) restraining them from granting permits to others than the petitioners in respect of copper covered by their contracts with importers.
All that is necessary to make cl. 4 effective is that some principles should be specified, and these notified in the Gazette and laid before the Houses of Parliament. It may be necessary from time to time to specify new principles in view of the changed circumstances; these have again to be notified in the Gazette and laid before the Houses of Parliament, in order to be effective. So long as new principles do not come into operation, by being specified by Government, and thereafter notified in the Gazette and laid before Houses of Parliament, the previous principles last specified, notified in the Gazette and laid before Houses of Parliament, will remain effective. As, however, the principles specified in the letter of the 18th April have not been notified in the Gazete, nor laid before Houses of Parliament, and no principles appear to have been specified before or after that date, cl. 4 of the order, as it now stands, must be struck down as void.

On behalf of the petitioners it has been urged that the prohibition of the exercise of a right must be distinguished from restriction on the exercise of a right, and when the Constitution speaks of laws imposing reasonable restrictions on the exercise of rights it does not save laws which prohibit the exercise of any such right. It is urged that the total elimination of the dealer amounting as it will to prohibition of any exercise of the right to carry on trade or to acquire property would therefore be in any case outside the saving provisions of cls. 5 and 6 of Art. 19. Certain observations made by Kania, C. J., and S. R. Das, J. (as he then was) in Gopalan'S Case (1) appear at first sight to lend support to this argument. At p. 106 of the Report, Kania, C. J., after pointing out that the 'deprivation of personal liberty has not the same meaning as restriction of free movement in the territory of India observed:-"
Das, J., at p. 301 of the Report, says :-
In Saghir Ahamad's Case (1) and in Chamarbaugwala's Case(2) the question whether prohibition of the exercise of a right was within the meaning of restrictions on the exercise of a right used in cl. 6 was raised but the Court decided to express no final opinion in the matter and left the question open. In Cooverjee's Case (3) the Court extended the provisions of Cl. 6 of Art. 19 to a law which had the effect of prohibiting the exercise of a right to carry on trade to many citizens. Mahajan, J., delivering the judgment of the Court observed:
In Madhya Bharat Cotton Association Ltd. (4), the Court had to consider the constitutionality of an order which in effect prohibited a large section of traders, from carrying on their normal trade in forward contracts. In holding the order to be valid, Bose, J., delivering the judgment of the Court said " Cotton being a commodity essential to the life of the community, it is reasonable to have restrictions which may, in certain (1)[1955] 1 S.C.R. 707.
(2)[1957] S.C.R. 874.	Precedent
exercise of the right of free movement throughout the territory of India as explained above. Imposition of reasonable restrictions clearly implies that the right of free movement is not entirely destroyed but that parts of the right remain."
to achieve and as such cannot be said to be a reasonable restriction on the exercise of the right."
The law was struck down because the restriction in this case amounting to prohibition was not reasonable and not because it was a prohibition.
(3)[1954] S.C. R. 873, 879.
(4)A.I. R. 1954 S.C. 634~, circumstances, extend to total prohibition for a time, of all normal trading in the commodity."
It is clear that in these three cases, viz., Chintaman Rao's Case (1), Cooverjee's Case (2) and Madhya Bharat Cotton Association Ltd. Case (3) the Court considered the real question to be whether the interference with the fundamental right, was " reasonable " or not in the interests of the general public and that if the answer to the question was in the affirmative, the law would be valid and it would be invalid if the test of reasonableness was not passed. Prohibition was in all these cases treated as only a kind of " restriction ". Any other view would, in our opinion, defeat the intention of the Constitution. After Art. 19(1) has conferred on the citizen the several rights set out in its seven sub-clauses, action is at once taken by the Constitution in cls. 2 to 6 to keep the way of social control free from unreasonable impediment. The raison detre of a State being the welfare of the members of the State by suitable legislation and appropriate administration, the whole purpose of the creation of the State would be frustrated if the conferment of these seven rights would result in cessation of legislation in the extensive fields where these seven rights operate. But without the saving provisions that would be the exact result of Art. 13 of the Constitution. It was to guard against this position that the Constitution provided in its cls. 2 to 6 that even in the fields of these rights new laws might be made and old laws would operate where this was necessary for general welfare. Laws imposing reasonable restriction on the exercise of the rights are saved by cl. 2 in respect of rights under sub-cl. (a) where the restrictions are " in the interests of the security of the State; " and of other matters mentioned therein; by cl. 3 in respect of the rights conferred by sub-cl. (b) where the restrictions are " in the interests of the public order; by cls. 4, 5 and 6 in respect of the rights conferred by sub-cls. (c), (d), (e), (f) & (g) the restrictions are " in the interest of the general public "-in cl. 5 which is in respect of rights conferred by sub- cls. (d), (1) [1950] S.C.R. 759. (2) [1954] 873. 879.
(3) A.I.R. 1954 S.C. 634.
(e) & (f) also where the restrictions are ',for the pro- tection of the interests of any scheduled tribe ". But for these saving provisions such laws would have been void because of Art. 13, which is in these words " All laws in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution, in so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of this Part, shall, to the extent, of such inconsistency be void; (2) The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of the contravention, be void . . . "
But without the principles, cl. 4 of the Order is not effective. The system of permits which this clause is designed to introduce can come into existence only if the permits can be issued; but permits can be issued only in accordance with the principles laid down by the Central Government. It is not possible to build on the use of the words " may specify " in cl. 4 an argument that so long as no principles are specified the Controller would have authority to issue permits by exercise -of his own judgment and discretion. The words used in cl . 4 do not permit such a construction and compel the conclusion that so long as the principles are not specified by the Central Government no permit can be issued by the Controller. Enforcement of the provision that no person shall acquire or agree to acquire except under a permit, would thus, so long as the principles are not specified in a legal manner as required by sub-ss. (5) and (6) of s. 3 of the Essential Commodities Act, would mean a total stoppage of the Copper trade-not only of the transactions of dealers but of any transaction whatever in imported copper. On the face of it this could not be a reasonable restriction in the interests of the general public. There is no escape therefore from the conclusion that so long as principles are not specified by the Central Government by an Order notified in accordance with sub-s. (5) and laid before both Houses of Parliament in accordance with sub-s. 6 of s. 3 the regulation by cl. 4 as it is now ,Worded is not within the - saying provisions of Arts. 19(5) and 19(6) of the Constitution, and is void as taking away the rights conferred by Arts. 19(1)(f) and 19(1)(g).	Section
The petitioners are therefore entitled to relief only in respect of cl. 4 of the order. We direct that an order be issued restraining the respondents from enforcing cl. 4 of the Non-ferrous Metal Control Order, so long as principles in accordance with law, are not published in the Official Gazette and laid before the Houses of Parliament in accordance with sub-s. (5) and sub- s. (6) of s. 3 of the Essential Commodities Act. As the petition has succeeded in part and failed in part, we order that the parties will bear their own costs. Petition partly allowed.

1959. December 3. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS GUPTAJ.-The three persons who have filed this petition under Art. 32 of the Constitution for enforcement of their fundamental rights conferred by Art. 14, Art. 19(1)(f) and Art. 19(1)(g) thereof are dealers in imported copper and carry on their business at Jagadhri in the State of Punjab. On different dates prior to April 3, 1958, they entered into contracts of purchase of copper with importers at Bombay and Calcutta. Before, however, they could take delivery from the importers the Government of India issued on April 2, 1958, an order called the " Non-ferrous Metal Control Order, 1958 " hereafter referred to as " the order " in exercise of its powers under s. 3 of the Essential Commodities Act (Act X of 1955)-referred to hereafter as " the Act ". In this order " non-ferrous metal " was defined to mean " imported copper, lead, tin and zinc in any of the forms specified in the Schedule of the order." The Order was from the very beginning made applicable to imported copper. The price was controlled by cl. 3 of the Order which provides in its first sub-clause that " no person shall sell or offer to sell any non-ferrous metal at a price which exceeds the amount represented by an addition of 3 1/2% to its landed cost,"
Clauses 5 and 6 of the Order made it obligatory on the importers to notify quantities of non-ferrous metal imported and to maintain certain books of account, while the last clause, i.e.. cl. 7 confers powers on the Controller to enter and search any premises in order to inspect any book or document and to seize any non-ferrous metal in certain circumstances. This Order was published in the Gazette of India on April 2, 1958. No principles specified by the Central Government in accordance with cl. 4 of the Order were however published either on this date or any other date. Certain principles were however specified by the Central Government in a communication addressed by the Deputy Secretary to the Government of India dated April 18, 1958, to the Chief Industrial Adviser to the Government of India, New Delhi. The relevant portion of this com- munication is in these words:
but if heavy imports are reported the Controller shall have the discretion to issue stocks in larger quantities." The position immediately on the issue of the Order on April 2, 1958, thus was that no person could buy or sell imported copper at a price above the landed Cost plus 31/2% thereof and that no person could acquire or agree to acquire such copper except under a permit issued by the Controller.

On behalf of the petitioners it has been urged that the prohibition of the exercise of a right must be distinguished from restriction on the exercise of a right, and when the Constitution speaks of laws imposing reasonable restrictions on the exercise of rights it does not save laws which prohibit the exercise of any such right. It is urged that the total elimination of the dealer amounting as it will to prohibition of any exercise of the right to carry on trade or to acquire property would therefore be in any case outside the saving provisions of cls. 5 and 6 of Art. 19. Certain observations made by Kania, C. J., and S. R. Das, J. (as he then was) in Gopalan'S Case (1) appear at first sight to lend support to this argument. At p. 106 of the Report, Kania, C. J., after pointing out that the 'deprivation of personal liberty has not the same meaning as restriction of free movement in the territory of India observed:-"
Das, J., at p. 301 of the Report, says :-
exercise of the right of free movement throughout the territory of India as explained above. Imposition of reasonable restrictions clearly implies that the right of free movement is not entirely destroyed but that parts of the right remain."
It has to be noticed, however, that these observ- ations were made in the context of an argument of conflict between Art. 19(5) and Art. 21 of the Constitution and could not have been intended for general application. Chintaman Rao v. The State of Madhya Pradesh (1) the constitutionality of the Central Provinces and Berar Regulation of Manufacture of Bidis (Agricultural Purposes) Act, came up for consideration, Mahajan, J., delivering the judgment of the Court, after pointing out that the question was whether the total prohibition of carrying on the business of manufacture of bidis within the agricultural season amounted to a reasonable restriction of the fundamental rights mentioned in Art. 19(1)(g) of the Constitution, based his decision that the impugned law did not come within the saving provisions of Art. 19(6) of the Constitution on the view that the test of reasonableness was not satisfied and not on a view that " prohibition " went beyond " restriction ". At p. 764 of the Report the learned Judge says:
to achieve and as such cannot be said to be a reasonable restriction on the exercise of the right."
The law was struck down because the restriction in this case amounting to prohibition was not reasonable and not because it was a prohibition.
In Saghir Ahamad's Case (1) and in Chamarbaugwala's Case(2) the question whether prohibition of the exercise of a right was within the meaning of restrictions on the exercise of a right used in cl. 6 was raised but the Court decided to express no final opinion in the matter and left the question open. In Cooverjee's Case (3) the Court extended the provisions of Cl. 6 of Art. 19 to a law which had the effect of prohibiting the exercise of a right to carry on trade to many citizens. Mahajan, J., delivering the judgment of the Court observed:
In Madhya Bharat Cotton Association Ltd. (4), the Court had to consider the constitutionality of an order which in effect prohibited a large section of traders, from carrying on their normal trade in forward contracts. In holding the order to be valid, Bose, J., delivering the judgment of the Court said " Cotton being a commodity essential to the life of the community, it is reasonable to have restrictions which may, in certain (1)[1955] 1 S.C.R. 707.

(4)A.I. R. 1954 S.C. 634~, circumstances, extend to total prohibition for a time, of all normal trading in the commodity."
It is clear that in these three cases, viz., Chintaman Rao's Case (1), Cooverjee's Case (2) and Madhya Bharat Cotton Association Ltd. Case (3) the Court considered the real question to be whether the interference with the fundamental right, was " reasonable " or not in the interests of the general public and that if the answer to the question was in the affirmative, the law would be valid and it would be invalid if the test of reasonableness was not passed.

(e) & (f) also where the restrictions are ',for the pro- tection of the interests of any scheduled tribe ". But for these saving provisions such laws would have been void because of Art. 13, which is in these words " All laws in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution, in so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of this Part, shall, to the extent, of such inconsistency be void; (2) The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of the contravention, be void . . . "
But without the principles, cl. 4 of the Order is not effective. The system of permits which this clause is designed to introduce can come into existence only if the permits can be issued; but permits can be issued only in accordance with the principles laid down by the Central Government. It is not possible to build on the use of the words " may specify " in cl. 4 an argument that so long as no principles are specified the Controller would have authority to issue permits by exercise -of his own judgment and discretion.

On the face of it this could not be a reasonable restriction in the interests of the general public. There is no escape therefore from the conclusion that so long as principles are not specified by the Central Government by an Order notified in accordance with sub-s.

All that is necessary to make cl. 4 effective is that some principles should be specified, and these notified in the Gazette and laid before the Houses of Parliament. It may be necessary from time to time to specify new principles in view of the changed circumstances; these have again to be notified in the Gazette and laid before the Houses of Parliament, in order to be effective.

The petitioners are therefore entitled to relief only in respect of cl. 4 of the order. We direct that an order be issued restraining the respondents from enforcing cl. 4 of the Non-ferrous Metal Control Order, so long as principles in accordance with law, are not published in the Official Gazette and laid before the Houses of Parliament in accordance with sub-s.
