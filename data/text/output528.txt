Issue
20. The car was delivered to the appellant on October 1, after he had paid Rs. 2,700 as custom duty and a cash deposit of Rs. 10,000 by way of security as the appellant intended to take the car back to Durban on his return. The party motored to Nardana on October 7, passing through Bangalore, Poona, Nasik and Dhulia. From there they travelled by train and reached Sarsa on October 8. The car was booked in an open truck from Nardana to Anand where it was taken delivery of and then driven to Sarsa. One Ratansing Kalusing Raol, Senior Police Inspector of Nadiad town, having noticed the car bearing no Indian number passing in the town instructed policemen to keep a watch. The appellants ordered to appear before the Sub-Inspector on October 12. On being questioned he stated that his family was the original inhabitant of Jamnagar State but for the last 60 years they were doing the business of contractors for purchasing and selling land in Durban. His brother Daud Issa was, however, serving in Bombay. He gave details of the journey performed by him and his companion and produced passports, as also the receipts for paying custom duty and the deposit. On October 15, Head Constable Ajit Singh, informed Raol that some unknown person had come to the shop of Umarbhai jeweller with a large quantity of gold. Accordingly the police visited the shop of the jeweller and his brother (also a jeweller) and came to know that gold had been given to him by the appellant to be melted. This gold along with some other gold kept at another place was seized by the police. The police also took possession of the car. The entire quantity of gold seized was 27731 tolas the value of which is roughly estimated at Rs. 3 lakhs. Proceedings under action 20 of the Indian Telegraph Act were instituted against the appellant and others on the assumption that the wireless set in the car was a transmitter but they were dropped when it was found otherwise. The car was thoroughly examined but nothing incriminating was found. The appellant was also detained under the Public Securities Act but was released. Ultimately on January 2, 1948, he along with others was prosecuted on the complaint of Raol for an offence under section 61 E of the Bombay District Police Act (IV of 1890) read with section 109 of the Indian Penal Code. Section 61E says:-	Facts
Mr. Chatterjee on behalf of the appellant stated at the outset that he was not prepared to concede that the appellant's conviction was right but he proceeded on the assumption that even if it was so, section 517 had no application to the case and the court had no jurisdiction to pass the order of confiscation of the gold. He also urged that 'in any, view of the matter the order of confiscation was not a proper order in the circumstances of this case. Section 517(1) reads thus:-	PetArg
M. C. Setalvad, Attorney-General for India (Porus A. Mehta, with him) for the respondent.	RespArg
The appellant, Suleman Issa, who is an inhabitant of Natal in South Africa left Durban in August, 1947, by car for India to pay a visit to his native place Sarsa in District Kaira where his sister was living with her husband Alimahmad Issak. He was accompanied by, Daud Hassam another brother-in-law and both travelled to Mombasa by car. From Mombasa they took a boat on August 30, and reached Colombo on September 1 1. They flew from Colombo to Madras on September 14, but shipped the car by a steamer. They stayed in Madras until the steamer arrived on September
He was convicted by the Magistrate and sentenced to a fine of Rs. 100 and the gold was directed to be confiscated under section 517 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The other accused who were charged with abetment were acquitted,. The Magistrate took the view that there wag no direct evidence to show that the accused had committed theft or had obtained property fraudulently but there were in his opinion circumstances which led to the reasonable belief that the gold in question was either stolen or was fraudulently obtained. The Sessions Judge held that although the possession of the gold was highly suspicious, nevertheless it did not constitute sufficient ground for a reasonable belief that the property was either stolen or was fraudulently obtained. He accordingly set aside the conviction and sentence and ordered the gold to be restored to the appellant. The High Court in appeal by the State did not accept the prosecution story that the gold was brought into India by the appellant in his motor-car, but held agreeing with the Magistrate that from the circumstances there was reason to believe that he was in possession of gold which was either stolen property or property fraudulently obtained. The High Court did not accept the explanation of the appellant that his father had brought the gold to Sarsa from time to time when he visited his native place. As regards the order of confiscation under section 517, the High Court held that it was not necessary that the property confiscated must be the property in relation to which an offence appears to have been committed but it was enough if ,the property is produced before the court. In this view the acquittal was set aside and the order of the Magistrate was restored.	Precedent
We accordingly set aside the order of confiscation and direct that the, gold seized from the appellant's possession shall be restored to him.
Appeal allowed.
