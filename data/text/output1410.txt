CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeals Nos. 147 & 148 of 1955.

V. M. Limaye, Mrs. E. Udayaratnam and S. S. Shukla, for the appellants (in both the appeals).
The last argument which Mr. Limaye faintly attempted to place before us was that the expression " any particular area" would not be applicable to the areas in which the appellants' lands are situated because, according to him, the expression should be construed in the light of the same expression used in s. 298(2)(a) of the Government of India Act, 1935. This argument is far fetched and fatuous and need not be considered.	PetArg

1960. August 25. The Judgment of Sinha, C. J., Kapur, Gajendragadkar and Wanchoo, JJ., was delivered by Gajendragadkar, J. Subba Rao, J., delivered a separate judgment.
In this connection we may also refer to the decision of this Court in The Edward Mills Co. Ltd., Beawar v. State of Ajmer (1), where the validity of the notification issued under the provisions of the Minimum Wages Act XI of 1948 was impeached, and the said challenge raised the question about the validity of the delegation provided for by s. 27 of the said Act. The scheme of the Act was that a schedule had been attached to it which gave a list of employments to. which the provisions of the Act applied an s. 7 gave power to the appropriate Government to add to either part of the schedule any employment in respect of which it was of opinion that the minimum wages shall be fixed and this the appropriate Government was authorised to do by giving notification in a broad manner, and thereupon the schedule shall, in its application to the State, be deemed to be amended accordingly. The argument was that the Act had nowhere formulated a legislative policy according to which an employment should be chosen for being included in the schedule; no principles had been prescribed and no standards laid down in that behalf, and so the delegation was unfettered and uncanalised. This argument was rejected by this Court on the broad consideration that the legislative policy was apparent on the face of the Act itself. " What the Act aims at ", observed Mukherjea, J., as he then was, "
The Legislature undoubtedly intended to apply this Act not to all industries but to those industries only where by reason of unorganised labour or want of proper arrangements for effective regulation of wages or for other causes the wages of labourers in a particular industry were very low ". The learned Judge then pointed out that conditions of labour vary under different circumstances and from State to State, and the expediency of including a particular trade or industry within the schedule depends upon a variety of facts which are not uniform and which can best be ascertained by the person who is placed in charge of administration of a particular State. It is with a view to carry out the particular purpose of the Act that power is delegated to the appropriate Government by s. 27. That is how the challenge to the vires of s. 27 was repelled.
The leading decision on this subject is In re The Delhi Laws Act, 1912 (1). There the Central Legislature had empowered the executive authority under its legislative control to apply at its discretion the laws to an area which was also under the legislative sway of the Centre. The validity of the laws was questioned (1) [1951] S.C.R. 747.
on the ground that the legislature bad no power to delegate legislative powers to executive authorities. As many as seven Judges dealt with the question and wrote seven separate judgments considering elaborately the different aspects of the question raised. I am relieved of the duty to ascertain the core of the decision as that has been done by Bose, J., with clarity in Rajnarain Singh v. The Chairman, Patna Administration Committee, Patna (1). Bose, J., after pointing out the seven variations of the authority given to the executive in the Delhi Laws Act Case (2), summarized the majority view on the relevant aspect of the question now raised at p. 301 thus:
Rajnarain Singh's Case (1) dealt with s. 3(1) of the Patna Administration Act, 1915, (Bihar and Orissa Act 1 of 1915) as amended by Patna Administration (Amendment) Act, 1928 (Bihar and Orissa Act IV of 1928) and with a notification issued by the Governor of Bihar picking out s. 194 out of the Bihar and Orissa Municipal Act of 1922, modifying it and extending it in its modified form to the Patna Administration and Patna Village areas. Bose, J., after pointing out the difference between Rajnarain Singh's Case (1) and the Delhi Laws Act Case (2) observed at p. 303 thus:
This Court again in Harishankar Bagla v. The State of Madhya Pradesh (3) considered the scope of the Delhi Laws Act Case (2). Mahajan, C. J., stated at p. 388 thus.
(1) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 290. (2) [1951] S.C.R. 747. (3) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 380.
In The Edward Mills Co., Ltd., Beawar v. The State of Ajmer (2), Mukherjea, J., as he then was, speaking for the Court stated the principle thus at p. 749:
The latest decision on the point is that in Hamdard Dawakhana v. Union of India (3). One of the questions raised in that case was whether s. 3(d) of Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954, exceeded the permissible limits of delegated legislation. The principle has been restated by Kapur, J., at p. 566 thus: , "This means that the legislature having laid down the broad principles of its policy in the legislation can then leave the details to be supplied by the administrative authority. In other words by delegated legislation the delegate completes the legislation by supplying details within the limits prescribed by the statute and in the case of conditional legislation the power of legislation is exercised by the legislature conditionally leaving to the discretion of an external (1) [1951] S.C.R. 747.
(2) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 735.
Applying the principle to the facts of that case, the learned Judge observed at p. 568 thus:	Precedent
GAJENDRAGADKAR J.-The appellants in these two appeals had filed two separate petitions under Art. 226 of the Constitution in the Bombay High Court in which they had challenged the vires of s. 6(2) of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948 (LXVII of 1948) (hereafter called the Act) and the validity of the notification issued by the Government on October 17, 1952, under the provisions of the said s. 6(2). It appears that on June 23, 1949, in exercise of the powers conferred by s. 6(2) of the Act, the Government had issued a notification fixing "
account the statements in the preamble to the Act, and if the said statements afford a satisfactory basis for holding that the legislative policy and principle has been enunciated with sufficient accuracy and clarity the preamble itself has been held to satisfy the requirements of the relevant tests. In every case it would be necessary to consider the relevant provisions of the Act in relation to the delegation made and the question as to whether the delegation is intra vires or not will have to be decided by the application of the relevant tests.
The present Act is undoubtedly a beneficent measure. It has enacted provisions for agrarian reform which the Legislature thought was overdue. The preamble shows that the object of the Act, inter alia, was to improve the economic and social condition of peasants and ensure the full and efficient use of land for agriculture. With that object the Act has made several provisions to safeguard the interests of the tenants. Let us consider some of these provisions. Section 6 which we have already set out prescribes the maximum rent payable by a tenant, and provides for the reduction of the said maximum by reference to particular areas. Section 7 lays down that the rent payable by tenants shall, subject to the maximum rate fixed under s. 6, be the rent agreed between the parties, or in the absence of any agreement or usage, or where there is a dispute as regards the reasonableness of the rent payable according to the agreement or usage, the reasonable rent. It is thus clear that even in regard to an agreed rent or a rent fixed by usage, if a tenant raises a dispute about its reasonableness that dispute has to be settled in the manner prescribed by the Act and the amount of reasonable rent determined. Section 8 provides for commutation of crop-share rent into cash. Section 9 prohibits a landlord from receiving from his tenant any rent in terms of service or labour; and it requires him to apply to the Mamlatdar for commuting such rent into cash. Section 10 provides for refund of excess rent recovered by the landlord from his tenant. Section 11 prohibits the recovery by the landlord of any cess, rate, vero, huk or tax or service of any description from the tenant other than the rent lawfully due from such land. Section 12 provides for enquiries in regard to the fixation of reasonable rent. On an application made by the tenant or the landlord in that behalf the Mamlatdar has to determine the reasonable rent under s. 12(3) having regard to the factors specified in the said sub-section. These factors are (a) the rental values of lands used for similar purposes in the locality, (b) the profits of agriculture of similar lands in the locality, (c) the prices of crops and commodities in the locality, (d) the improvements made in the land by the landlord or the tenant,
(e) the assessment payable in respect of the land, and (f) such other factors as may be prescribed. There is no doubt that the last clause which refers to other factors must be construed as referring to factors ejusdem generis with those that have been previously enumerated. Section 13 provides for the suspension or remission of rent, and the conditions under which the said remission or suspension can be granted. It would thus be seen that the material provisions of the Act aim at giving relief to the tenants by fixing the maximum rent payable by them and by providing for a speedy machinery to consider their complaints about the unreasonableness of the rent claimed from them by their respective landlords. It is in the light of this policy of the Act which is writ large on the face of these provisions that we have to consider the question as to whether the delegation made by s. 6(2) suffers from the infirmity of excessive delegation.
12. It is true that the power to fix a reasonable rent conferred on the Mamlatdar under s. 12 is subject to the power of the Provincial Government under s. 6(2). Even so we think it would be difficult to hold that the factors prescribed for the guidance of the Mamlatdar would have no relevance at all when the Provincial Government acts under s. 6(2). In our opinion, therefore, having regard to the legislative policy laid down by the Act in its preamble and in the other relevant sections to which we have referred, and having regard to the guidance which has been provided for fixing a reasonable rent under s. 12(3), it would not be possible to hold that the power delegated to the Provincial Government by s. 6(2) suffers from the infirmity of excessive delegation The fact that no minimum has been prescribed would not materially affect this position. Mr. Limaye has then contended that even if s. 6(2) is valid the impugned notification is invalid because it offends against Art. 31 of the Constitution. He concedes that the Act itself is saved under Art. 31B since it is one of the Acts enumerated in the Ninth Schedule; but his argument is that the notification has in substance amended the provisions of s. 6(1) and thus it amounts to a fresh legislation to which Art. 31B cannot apply. There is no, substance in this argument. If s. 6(2) is valid then the exercise of the power validly conferred on the Provincial Government cannot be treated as fresh legislation which offends against Art. 31. If the Act is saved by Art. 31B s. 6(2) is also saved, and the power must be held to be validly conferred on the Provincial Government, and a notification issued by virtue of the said powers cannot be challenged on the ground that it violates Art. 31.
The next argument is that the notification is invalid because the power to issue a notification conferred by s. 6(2) was exhausted as soon as the Government issued the first notification on June 23, 1949. This argument proceeds on the assumption that the power conferred on the Government by s. 6(2) can be exercised only once, and it seeks to derive support from the fact that the words " from time to time " which were used in the corresponding section of the earlier tenancy legislation in the State have not been used in s. 6(2). Reliance is also placed on the fact that the said words have been used in s. 8(1) of the Act. The omission of the said words from s. 6(2) as contrasted with their inclusion in s. 8(1), says Mr. Limaye, indicates that the power delegated under s. 6(2) was intended to be used only once. This argument is fallacious. Why the Legislature did not use the words " from time to time " in s. 6(2) when it used them in s. 8(1) it is difficult to understand ; but in Construing s. 6(2) it is obviously necessary to apply the provisions of s. 14 of the Bombay General Clauses Act 1904 (1 of 1904). Section 14 provides that where by any Bombay Act made after the commencement of this Act any power is conferred on any Government then that power may be exercised from. time to time as occasion requires. Quite clearly if s. 6(2) is read in the light of s. 14 of the Bombay General Clauses Act it must follow that the power to issue a notification can be exercised from time to time as occasion requires. It is true that s. 14 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 (X of 1897), provides that where any power is conferred by any Central Act or Regulation then, unless a different intention appears, that power may be exercised from time to time as occasion requires. Since there is a specific provision of the Bombay General Clauses Act relevant on the point it is unnecessary to take recourse to s. 14 of the Central General Clauses Act ; but even if we were to assume that the power in question can be exercised from time to time unless a different intention appears we would feel no difficulty in holding that no such different intention can be attributed to the Legislature when it enacted s. 6(2). It is obvious that having prescribed for a maximum. by s. 6(1) the Legislature has deliberately provided for a modification of the said maximum rent and that itself shows that the fixation of any maximum rent was not treated as immutable. If it was necessary to issue one notification under s. 6(2) it would follow by force of the same logic that circumstances may require the issue of a further notification. The fixation of agricultural rent depends upon so many uncertain factors which may vary from time to time and from place to place that it would be idle to contend that the Legislature wanted to fix the maximum only once, or, as Mr. Limaye concedes, twice. Therefore the argument that the power to issue a notification has been exhausted cannot be sustained.
The facts have been fully stated in the judgment of my learned brother and I need not restate them here. It would be enough if I expressed my opinion on the said question. Learned counsel for the appellants attacks the con- stitutional validity of s. 6(2) on the ground that the said subsection exceeds the limits of permissible delegated legislation. Before considering the validity of s. 6(2), it would be convenient to notice briefly the relevant aspects of the law of the doctrine of delegated legislation. The scope of the doctrine of delegation of legislation has been so authoritatively laid down by this Court in more than one decision that it would be pedantic to attempt to resurvey the field over again. I would, therefore, be content to collate the relevant passages from the decisions of this-Court to ascertain the principle underlying the doctrine.
authority the time and manner of carrying its legislation into effect as also the determination of the area to which it is to extend."
Under this section the Provincial Government may fix a lower rate of the maximum in any particular area or to fix such rate on any other suitable basis. Three elastic words are used in s. 6(2), namely, (1) lower rate; (2) particular area ; and (3) on any other suitable basis. Prima facie in s. 6(2) the legislature has not laid down any policy or any standard to enable the Provincial Government to reduce the maximum rent fixed under s. 6(1). What is the limit of the lower rate the Government is empowered to fix ? What is the extent of the area with reference to which that rate can be fixed? What are the conditions prevailing in a particular area which require the reduction of the maximum rent ? Even if there are conditions justifiable for reduction of the maximum rent, what is the basis for that reduction ? The disjunctive " or " between " particular area " and " may fix" and the word ,other" qualifying " suitable basis "	Section
In the result the appeals fail and are dismissed with costs. SUBBARAO J.-I have had the advantage of perusing the judgment prepared by Gajendragadkar, J. I regret my inability to agree with my learned brother on the question of the vires of s. 6(2) of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948 (LXVII of 1948) (hereinafter called the Act).

1960. August 25. The Judgment of Sinha, C. J., Kapur, Gajendragadkar and Wanchoo, JJ., was delivered by Gajendragadkar, J. Subba Rao, J., delivered a separate judgment.
GAJENDRAGADKAR J.-The appellants in these two appeals had filed two separate petitions under Art. 226 of the Constitution in the Bombay High Court in which they had challenged the vires of s. 6(2) of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948 (LXVII of 1948) (hereafter called the Act) and the validity of the notification issued by the Government on October 17, 1952, under the provisions of the said s. 6(2). It appears that on June 23, 1949, in exercise of the powers conferred by s. 6(2) of the Act, the Government had issued a notification fixing "
account the statements in the preamble to the Act, and if the said statements afford a satisfactory basis for holding that the legislative policy and principle has been enunciated with sufficient accuracy and clarity the preamble itself has been held to satisfy the requirements of the relevant tests. In every case it would be necessary to consider the relevant provisions of the Act in relation to the delegation made and the question as to whether the delegation is intra vires or not will have to be decided by the application of the relevant tests.
In this connection we may also refer to the decision of this Court in The Edward Mills Co. Ltd., Beawar v. State of Ajmer (1), where the validity of the notification issued under the provisions of the Minimum Wages Act XI of 1948 was impeached, and the said challenge raised the question about the validity of the delegation provided for by s. 27 of the said Act. The scheme of the Act was that a schedule had been attached to it which gave a list of employments to. which the provisions of the Act applied an s. 7 gave power to the appropriate Government to add to either part of the schedule any employment in respect of which it was of opinion that the minimum wages shall be fixed and this the appropriate Government was authorised to do by giving notification in a broad manner, and thereupon the schedule shall, in its application to the State, be deemed to be amended accordingly. The argument was that the Act had nowhere formulated a legislative policy according to which an employment should be chosen for being included in the schedule; no principles had been prescribed and no standards laid down in that behalf, and so the delegation was unfettered and uncanalised. This argument was rejected by this Court on the broad consideration that the legislative policy was apparent on the face of the Act itself. " What the Act aims at ", observed Mukherjea, J., as he then was, "
The Legislature undoubtedly intended to apply this Act not to all industries but to those industries only where by reason of unorganised labour or want of proper arrangements for effective regulation of wages or for other causes the wages of labourers in a particular industry were very low ". The learned Judge then pointed out that conditions of labour vary under different circumstances and from State to State, and the expediency of including a particular trade or industry within the schedule depends upon a variety of facts which are not uniform and which can best be ascertained by the person who is placed in charge of administration of a particular State. It is with a view to carry out the particular purpose of the Act that power is delegated to the appropriate Government by s. 27. That is how the challenge to the vires of s. 27 was repelled.
The present Act is undoubtedly a beneficent measure. It has enacted provisions for agrarian reform which the Legislature thought was overdue. The preamble shows that the object of the Act, inter alia, was to improve the economic and social condition of peasants and ensure the full and efficient use of land for agriculture. With that object the Act has made several provisions to safeguard the interests of the tenants. Let us consider some of these provisions. Section 6 which we have already set out prescribes the maximum rent payable by a tenant, and provides for the reduction of the said maximum by reference to particular areas. Section 7 lays down that the rent payable by tenants shall, subject to the maximum rate fixed under s. 6, be the rent agreed between the parties, or in the absence of any agreement or usage, or where there is a dispute as regards the reasonableness of the rent payable according to the agreement or usage, the reasonable rent. It is thus clear that even in regard to an agreed rent or a rent fixed by usage, if a tenant raises a dispute about its reasonableness that dispute has to be settled in the manner prescribed by the Act and the amount of reasonable rent determined. Section 8 provides for commutation of crop-share rent into cash. Section 9 prohibits a landlord from receiving from his tenant any rent in terms of service or labour; and it requires him to apply to the Mamlatdar for commuting such rent into cash. Section 10 provides for refund of excess rent recovered by the landlord from his tenant. Section 11 prohibits the recovery by the landlord of any cess, rate, vero, huk or tax or service of any description from the tenant other than the rent lawfully due from such land. Section 12 provides for enquiries in regard to the fixation of reasonable rent. On an application made by the tenant or the landlord in that behalf the Mamlatdar has to determine the reasonable rent under s. 12(3) having regard to the factors specified in the said sub-section. These factors are (a) the rental values of lands used for similar purposes in the locality, (b) the profits of agriculture of similar lands in the locality, (c) the prices of crops and commodities in the locality, (d) the improvements made in the land by the landlord or the tenant,
(e) the assessment payable in respect of the land, and (f) such other factors as may be prescribed. There is no doubt that the last clause which refers to other factors must be construed as referring to factors ejusdem generis with those that have been previously enumerated. Section 13 provides for the suspension or remission of rent, and the conditions under which the said remission or suspension can be granted. It would thus be seen that the material provisions of the Act aim at giving relief to the tenants by fixing the maximum rent payable by them and by providing for a speedy machinery to consider their complaints about the unreasonableness of the rent claimed from them by their respective landlords. It is in the light of this policy of the Act which is writ large on the face of these provisions that we have to consider the question as to whether the delegation made by s. 6(2) suffers from the infirmity of excessive delegation.
Broadly stated s. 6(2) seeks to provide for the fixation of a lower rate of maximum rent area-wise. We have already seen that individual tenants are given the right to apply for the fixation of reasonable rent by s. 12, and specific factors have been specified which the Mamlatdar must consider in fixing a reasonable rent. The Legislature realised that a large number of tenants in the State were poor, ignorant and in many cases helpless, and it was thought that many of them may not be able to make individual applications for the fixation of a reasonable rent under s. 12. That is why it was thought necessary to confer upon the Provincial Government the power to fix a lower rate of the maximum rent payable by tenants in respect of particular areas. In a sense what could be done by the Mamlatdar in individual cases can be achieved by the Provincial Government in respect of a large number of cases covered in a particular area. If that be so, the legislative policy having been clearly expressed in the relevant provisions and the factors for determining reasonable rent also having been specified in s. 12(3), it is difficult to accept the argument that the Provincial Government has been given uncanalised or unfettered powers by s. 6(2) to do what it likes without any guidance. The relevant factors having been specified by s. 12(3) when the Provincial Government considers the question of fixing a lower rate of the maximum rent payable in any particular area it is expected to adopt a basis which is suitable to that particular area. The relevant conditions of agriculture would not be uniform in different areas and the problem of fixing a reduced maximum rent payable in the respective areas would have to be tackled in the light of the special features and conditions of that area ; that is why a certain amount of latitude had to be left to the Government in fixing the lower rate of the maximum rent in the respective areas, and that is intended to be achieved by giving it liberty to adopt a basis which it thinks is suitable for the area in question. The word " suitable " in the context must mean I suitable to the area' having regard to the other provisions of the Act such as s. 6(1) and s.
12. It is true that the power to fix a reasonable rent conferred on the Mamlatdar under s. 12 is subject to the power of the Provincial Government under s. 6(2). Even so we think it would be difficult to hold that the factors prescribed for the guidance of the Mamlatdar would have no relevance at all when the Provincial Government acts under s. 6(2). In our opinion, therefore, having regard to the legislative policy laid down by the Act in its preamble and in the other relevant sections to which we have referred, and having regard to the guidance which has been provided for fixing a reasonable rent under s. 12(3), it would not be possible to hold that the power delegated to the Provincial Government by s. 6(2) suffers from the infirmity of excessive delegation The fact that no minimum has been prescribed would not materially affect this position. Mr. Limaye has then contended that even if s. 6(2) is valid the impugned notification is invalid because it offends against Art. 31 of the Constitution. He concedes that the Act itself is saved under Art. 31B since it is one of the Acts enumerated in the Ninth Schedule; but his argument is that the notification has in substance amended the provisions of s. 6(1) and thus it amounts to a fresh legislation to which Art. 31B cannot apply. There is no, substance in this argument. If s. 6(2) is valid then the exercise of the power validly conferred on the Provincial Government cannot be treated as fresh legislation which offends against Art. 31. If the Act is saved by Art. 31B s. 6(2) is also saved, and the power must be held to be validly conferred on the Provincial Government, and a notification issued by virtue of the said powers cannot be challenged on the ground that it violates Art. 31.
The next argument is that the notification is invalid because the power to issue a notification conferred by s. 6(2) was exhausted as soon as the Government issued the first notification on June 23, 1949. This argument proceeds on the assumption that the power conferred on the Government by s. 6(2) can be exercised only once, and it seeks to derive support from the fact that the words " from time to time " which were used in the corresponding section of the earlier tenancy legislation in the State have not been used in s. 6(2). Reliance is also placed on the fact that the said words have been used in s. 8(1) of the Act. The omission of the said words from s. 6(2) as contrasted with their inclusion in s. 8(1), says Mr. Limaye, indicates that the power delegated under s. 6(2) was intended to be used only once. This argument is fallacious. Why the Legislature did not use the words " from time to time " in s. 6(2) when it used them in s. 8(1) it is difficult to understand ; but in Construing s. 6(2) it is obviously necessary to apply the provisions of s. 14 of the Bombay General Clauses Act 1904 (1 of 1904). Section 14 provides that where by any Bombay Act made after the commencement of this Act any power is conferred on any Government then that power may be exercised from. time to time as occasion requires. Quite clearly if s. 6(2) is read in the light of s. 14 of the Bombay General Clauses Act it must follow that the power to issue a notification can be exercised from time to time as occasion requires. It is true that s. 14 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 (X of 1897), provides that where any power is conferred by any Central Act or Regulation then, unless a different intention appears, that power may be exercised from time to time as occasion requires. Since there is a specific provision of the Bombay General Clauses Act relevant on the point it is unnecessary to take recourse to s. 14 of the Central General Clauses Act ; but even if we were to assume that the power in question can be exercised from time to time unless a different intention appears we would feel no difficulty in holding that no such different intention can be attributed to the Legislature when it enacted s. 6(2).

The fixation of agricultural rent depends upon so many uncertain factors which may vary from time to time and from place to place that it would be idle to contend that the Legislature wanted to fix the maximum only once, or, as Mr. Limaye concedes, twice. Therefore the argument that the power to issue a notification has been exhausted cannot be sustained.
The last argument which Mr. Limaye faintly attempted to place before us was that the expression " any particular area" would not be applicable to the areas in which the appellants' lands are situated because, according to him, the expression should be construed in the light of the same expression used in s. 298(2)(a) of the Government of India Act, 1935. This argument is far fetched and fatuous and need not be considered.
In the result the appeals fail and are dismissed with costs. SUBBARAO J.-I have had the advantage of perusing the judgment prepared by Gajendragadkar, J. I regret my inability to agree with my learned brother on the question of the vires of s. 6(2) of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1948 (LXVII of 1948) (hereinafter called the Act).
The facts have been fully stated in the judgment of my learned brother and I need not restate them here. It would be enough if I expressed my opinion on the said question.

I would, therefore, be content to collate the relevant passages from the decisions of this-Court to ascertain the principle underlying the doctrine.
The leading decision on this subject is In re The Delhi Laws Act, 1912 (1). There the Central Legislature had empowered the executive authority under its legislative control to apply at its discretion the laws to an area which was also under the legislative sway of the Centre. The validity of the laws was questioned (1) [1951] S.C.R. 747.
on the ground that the legislature bad no power to delegate legislative powers to executive authorities. As many as seven Judges dealt with the question and wrote seven separate judgments considering elaborately the different aspects of the question raised. I am relieved of the duty to ascertain the core of the decision as that has been done by Bose, J., with clarity in Rajnarain Singh v. The Chairman, Patna Administration Committee, Patna (1). Bose, J., after pointing out the seven variations of the authority given to the executive in the Delhi Laws Act Case (2), summarized the majority view on the relevant aspect of the question now raised at p. 301 thus:
Rajnarain Singh's Case (1) dealt with s. 3(1) of the Patna Administration Act, 1915, (Bihar and Orissa Act 1 of 1915) as amended by Patna Administration (Amendment) Act, 1928 (Bihar and Orissa Act IV of 1928) and with a notification issued by the Governor of Bihar picking out s. 194 out of the Bihar and Orissa Municipal Act of 1922, modifying it and extending it in its modified form to the Patna Administration and Patna Village areas. Bose, J., after pointing out the difference between Rajnarain Singh's Case (1) and the Delhi Laws Act Case (2) observed at p. 303 thus:
This Court again in Harishankar Bagla v. The State of Madhya Pradesh (3) considered the scope of the Delhi Laws Act Case (2). Mahajan, C. J., stated at p. 388 thus.
(1) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 290. (2) [1951] S.C.R. 747. (3) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 380.
In The Edward Mills Co., Ltd., Beawar v. The State of Ajmer (2), Mukherjea, J., as he then was, speaking for the Court stated the principle thus at p. 749:
The latest decision on the point is that in Hamdard Dawakhana v. Union of India (3). One of the questions raised in that case was whether s. 3(d) of Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954, exceeded the permissible limits of delegated legislation. The principle has been restated by Kapur, J., at p. 566 thus: , "This means that the legislature having laid down the broad principles of its policy in the legislation can then leave the details to be supplied by the administrative authority. In other words by delegated legislation the delegate completes the legislation by supplying details within the limits prescribed by the statute and in the case of conditional legislation the power of legislation is exercised by the legislature conditionally leaving to the discretion of an external (1) [1951] S.C.R. 747.
(2) [1955] 1 S.C.R. 735.
(3) [1960] 2 S.C.R. 671.
authority the time and manner of carrying its legislation into effect as also the determination of the area to which it is to extend."
Applying the principle to the facts of that case, the learned Judge observed at p. 568 thus:
Under this section the Provincial Government may fix a lower rate of the maximum in any particular area or to fix such rate on any other suitable basis. Three elastic words are used in s. 6(2), namely, (1) lower rate; (2) particular area ; and (3) on any other suitable basis. Prima facie in s. 6(2) the legislature has not laid down any policy or any standard to enable the Provincial Government to reduce the maximum rent fixed under s. 6(1). What is the limit of the lower rate the Government is empowered to fix ? What is the extent of the area with reference to which that rate can be fixed? What are the conditions prevailing in a particular area which require the reduction of the maximum rent ? Even if there are conditions justifiable for reduction of the maximum rent, what is the basis for that reduction ? The disjunctive " or " between " particular area " and " may fix" and the word ,other" qualifying " suitable basis "	Total Judgement
