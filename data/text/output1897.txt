SARKAR J. - The respondent in this appeal is the assessee. She is the wife of one Sheikh Abdul Khader who lived in Siam. In the year 1941-42, she received from her husband from Siam a sum of Rs. 9,180. It is not disputed that this amount constituted "Income" in her hands within section 4(2) of the Income-tax Act, 1922. She did not however submit any return in respect of it. On July 25, 1949, a notice under section 34 of the Act was issued to her asking her to file a return. Thereafter, she was assessed on therefore income on October 24, 1949. She appealed from that order but was unsuccessful in having the assessment set aside. At her request, the Appellate Tribunal submitted the following question to the High Court at Madras for its decision :	Facts
For the reasons given by me in S. C. Prashar, Income-tax Officer, Market Ward, Bombay v. Vasantsen Dawarkadas, in which judgment has been delivered today. I think that the High Court correctly answered the question referred to it.
The High Court answered the question in negative. The revenue authorities have, therefore, come up in appeal.	Precedent
The relevant assessment year was 1942-43. The proceedings under section 34 of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, were initiated with the issue of a notice on July 25, 1949. The assessees contention was that the initiation of proceedings on July 25, 1949, was invalid as the departments right to revive the assessment was governed by the old section 34 where the period of limitation prescribed was only four years in the case of failure to file a return and this period having expired on March 31, 1947, and the Amending Act of 1948 (XLVIII of 1948) having come into force on March 30, 1948, the eight years period provided therein could not be invoked. The High Court upheld this contention and said :
It was held that the limitation of eight years prescribed by section 34 as amended by the Amending Act of 1948 did not apply to the case of assessee which was a case of failure to submit the return and the period four years had expired before March 30, 1948, when the amendment in section 34 was made by the Amending Act of 1948. It was also held that section 31 of the Amending Act of 1953 was not applicable and the question was therefore answered in the negative. Against that judgment and order the Commissioner of Income-tax has come in appeal to this court.
Section 34 contains provisions for assessment and reassessment in cases where income for any year has not in the relevant assessment year been fully assessed for the reasons mentioned in it. With these reasons it not necessary to trouble ourselves in this appeal. Sub-section (1) of section 34 deals with the period of time within which a notice calling for a return of the escaped income may be served and sub-section (3) deals with the time within which the assessment can be made. This section was amended by the Income-tax and Business Profits Tax (Amendment) Act, 1948. This Act was on September 8, 1948, but the section which amended Section 34 of the Income-tax Act was brought into force retrospectively from March 30, 1948. It is not in dispute that under section 34, as it stood before the amendment, the time to issue the notice calling for a return and to make the assessment in this case had expired on March 31, 1947, that is, on expiry of four years after the year in which the escaped income was first assessable, namely, 1942-43. It is not is dispute either that under section 34, as it stood after the amendment in 1948, the notice could be served and an assessment made within eight years from the end of that year, that is, in this case, within March 31, 1951. The notice and the assessment order impugned in this case have, therefore, to be held to be valid if section 34 after its amendment in 1948 was applicable. It is the contention of the appellant that it was so applicable. The High Court held that the time having already expired under the existing law the amended section 34 could not be given retrospective operation to validate the notice and the order of assessment.
Now, on May 24, 1953, was passed the Income-tax (Amendment) Act, 1953, (XXV of 1953), which was brought into force retrospectively from April 1, 1952. This Act contained a section, namely, section 31, which in my mind makes section 34 as amended by the 1948 Amending Act, applicable to the proceedings in this case. I am unable to accept the High Courts view to the contrary and regret my inability to comprehend the reasons on which that view is based. That section also amended sub-section (3) of section 34 so as to included in it provisions regarding the time of the issue of the notice but we will not be concerned with this amendment in this appeal now section 31 is in the these terms :	Section
I would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.
This case is governed by the decision in C. A. No. 705/57 (S. C. Prashar v. Vasantsen Dwarkadas), the judgment in which has been delivered today. The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs. The appellant was granted the certificate by the High Court expressly on the condition that he would pay the costs of this appeal in any event to which he had agreed.	Conclusion

SARKAR J. - The respondent in this appeal is the assessee. She is the wife of one Sheikh Abdul Khader who lived in Siam. In the year 1941-42, she received from her husband from Siam a sum of Rs. 9,180. It is not disputed that this amount constituted "Income" in her hands within section 4(2) of the Income-tax Act, 1922. She did not however submit any return in respect of it. On July 25, 1949, a notice under section 34 of the Act was issued to her asking her to file a return. Thereafter, she was assessed on therefore income on October 24, 1949. She appealed from that order but was unsuccessful in having the assessment set aside. At her request, the Appellate Tribunal submitted the following question to the High Court at Madras for its decision :
The High Court answered the question in negative. The revenue authorities have, therefore, come up in appeal.
Section 34 contains provisions for assessment and reassessment in cases where income for any year has not in the relevant assessment year been fully assessed for the reasons mentioned in it. With these reasons it not necessary to trouble ourselves in this appeal. Sub-section (1) of section 34 deals with the period of time within which a notice calling for a return of the escaped income may be served and sub-section (3) deals with the time within which the assessment can be made. This section was amended by the Income-tax and Business Profits Tax (Amendment) Act, 1948. This Act was on September 8, 1948, but the section which amended Section 34 of the Income-tax Act was brought into force retrospectively from March 30, 1948. It is not in dispute that under section 34, as it stood before the amendment, the time to issue the notice calling for a return and to make the assessment in this case had expired on March 31, 1947, that is, on expiry of four years after the year in which the escaped income was first assessable, namely, 1942-43.
