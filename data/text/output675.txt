Prithi Nath vs Birkha Nath And Anr. on 4 October, 1955	Case Title
1. This Appeal is directed against a judgment of the High Court of Judicature for the State of Punjab at Simla in Letters Patent Appeal No. 108 of 1951 reversing the judgment of a single Judge of the High Court in Regular Second Appeal No. 942 of 1949 & dismissing the Appellant's suit with costs throughout.
A second appeal was filed by Respondent 1 against this decision of the District Judge, Delhi, in the High Court of Judicature for the State of Punjab at Simla. This appeal was heard by a single Judge who also confirmed the decision of the trial court and dismissed the appeal with costs throughout. The Respondent 1 filed a Letters Patent appeal against this decision of the single Judge.
7. The only point which arises for consideration before us is whether the Appellant has succeeded in proving the rule of succession propounded by him in the plaint.	Issue
2. The suit out of which the present Appeal arises was instituted by the Appellant in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, First Class, Delhi, against the Respondents 1 & 2 for a declaration that he was the Mahant of the Temple of Bhaironji and as such entitled to the properties and the per-quisities attached thereto including the right to worship in the Temple of Sri Kalkaji and to recover the income from rents etc., as also from offerings and for other reliefs.
3. The case of the Appellant was that one Baba Balak Nath was the Mahant of the Temple of Bhaironji and he left him surviving his three Chelas Sehaj Nath, Maya Nath and Sahib Nath. The pedigree showing the representation of these three lines of descent from Balak Nath is given below:
After setting out the custom as above, the Appellant gave in para 7 of the plaint an illustration of the extinction of a line, no Chela having been left therein and the consequent devolution of succession upon the remaining lines:--	Facts
Mr. Achhru Ram appearing before us for Respondent 1 also did not challenge that finding with the result that that contention must be taken as negatived. The Appellant has, however, got to succeed on the strength of his own title and not on the infirmity of that of Respondent 1 and he has, therefore, got to establish the rule of succession propounded by him in paras 4 and 6 of the plaint.	RespArg
4. The Respondent 1 disputed this claim of the Appellant. The rule of succession was propounded by him in paragraph 4 of his written statement as under:--
The Division Bench, hearing the Letters Patent appeal, came to a contrary conclusion, held that the Appellant had not proved the custom set up by him and allowed the appeal dismissing the Appellant's suit with costs throughout. This Appeal was filed by the Appellant against that decision of the Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature for the State of Punjab at Simla on a certificate granted by the High Court under Article 133 of the Constitution.
8. It may be observed at the outset that Respondent 1 failed to prove the rule of succession which he set out in para 4 of his written statement and the finding reached by the trial court, in this behalf that there has never been any election to the office of Mahant in these institutions was not challenged in the Court of the District Judge, Delhi, nor before the High Court.
The elective principle having been negatived it can be safely assumed that the succession to the estate in these lines of descent from Balak Nath was hereditary and it devolved from 'Guru' to 'Chela'. As a matter of fact, the findings reached by the District Judge, Delhi, in regard to the succession in these three lines go to establish that the rule of succession was from 'Guru' to 'Chela'. The facts found by him were as under: --
9. What happens when a particular line becomes extinct has, however, been the subject-matter of divergent opinions between the two lower Courts and the High Court in Second Appeal on the one hand and the Letters Patent Bench on the other. All the three Courts who came to the conclusion in favour of the Appellant in this behalf were of the opinion that the extinction of the line of Sehaj Nath on the death of Bhola Nath afforded an instance of the second part of the rule of succession propounded by the Appellant, viz., that on the extinction of a line, no Chela having been left therein, Succession devolved upon the remaining lines.
Having regard to the finding reached by the trial Court which finding was not challenged by the Appellant before the District Judge, Delhi, or before the High Court that Respondent 1 was the Chela of Phul Nath who belonged to the line of Maya Nath, it came to the conclusion that there was a Chela in that line and, therefore, the line could not be extinct.
Phul Nath, the Guru of Respondent 1 was then alive and if propinquity of relation ship in this spiritual descent which we are concerned with was the criterion of the right to inheritance, Phul Nath was certainly nearer in relationship than Sandhiya Nath and he could have claimed to inherit the property of Bhola Nath to the extent of the 1/2 share therein along with Pancham Nath.
No such claim was, however, made by Phul Nath and Sandhiya Nath, as the representative of the line of Maya Nath was the only person who made such claim for inheritance and was recognized as the heir of Bhola Nath along with Pancham Nath when mutation came to be made.
11. It was, however, urged by Mr. Achhru Ram that unless the Appellant proved that when Bhola Nath died on 10th April, 1918, there were Chelas existing in the line of Sehaj Nath & yet the line of Sehaj Nath was treated as extinct and the succession devolved upon Pancham Nath and Sandhiya Nath who represented the two surviving lines of Sahib Nath and Maya Nath, the second part of the rule of succession propounded by the Appellant could not be held proved.
The answer to this contention was furnished by the District Judge, Delhi in his judgment when he observed that it was admitted that Sehaj Nath had three Chelas and it was improbable that the other two Chelas who did not succeed had no Chela of their own; nor was it very probable that Sanwat Nath and Shiv Nath in turn had no other Chelas apart from their own who actually succeeded.
Another circumstance relied upon by the learned Dist. Judge in support of this position was that in the disputed line there were other Chelas actually living & one of them, Har Nath had given evidence as the witness of Respondent 1. He was the Chela of Misri Nath and thus nearer in spiritual relationship to the last Mahant than Respondent 1: yet Har Nath had never made any claim to the Gaddi that was now in dispute although if the case of Respondent 1 was well-founded Har Nath was entitled to the Gaddi in preference to him.	Precedent
The reason could only have been that Har Nath knew that not being the Chela of the last Mahant nor the Chela of the Gurbhai he had no claim.	Section
The Appellant was accordingly found to be the rightful claimant to the Gaddi and rights and interests of Sandhiya Nath in both the above religious institutions and to lands in village Bahapur. The suit was, therefore, decreed in favour of the Appellant with costs.
6. The Respondent 1 took an appeal to the Court of the District Judge, Delhi, and the District Judge, Delhi, accepted the conclusion of the trial Court in regard to the rule of succession, dismissed the appeal and confirmed the decree passed by the trial court in favour of the Appellant though it varied the order of costs ordering both the parties to bear their own costs in both the Courts.
We are, therefore, of the opinion that on the death of Sandhiya Nath, his Chelas Shanker Nath, Hardwari Nath and Badlu Nath succeeded to the properties left by him one after the other and that when Badlu Nath died there was neither his Chela or any Gurbhai of his who could succeed to the properties with the result that there was no succession possible in that line from 'Guru' to 'Chela' and the line became extinct.
We accordingly allow the Appeal, set aside the judgment of the Letters Patent Bench and restore the decree passed by the trial Court in favour of the Appellant with costs payable by Respondent 1 throughout.	Conclusion
1. This Appeal is directed against a judgment of the High Court of Judicature for the State of Punjab at Simla in Letters Patent Appeal No. 108 of 1951 reversing the judgment of a single Judge of the High Court in Regular Second Appeal No. 942 of 1949 & dismissing the Appellant's suit with costs throughout.
2. The suit out of which the present Appeal arises was instituted by the Appellant in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, First Class, Delhi, against the Respondents 1 & 2 for a declaration that he was the Mahant of the Temple of Bhaironji and as such entitled to the properties and the per-quisities attached thereto including the right to worship in the Temple of Sri Kalkaji and to recover the income from rents etc., as also from offerings and for other reliefs.
3. The case of the Appellant was that one Baba Balak Nath was the Mahant of the Temple of Bhaironji and he left him surviving his three Chelas Sehaj Nath, Maya Nath and Sahib Nath. The pedigree showing the representation of these three lines of descent from Balak Nath is given below:
After setting out the custom as above, the Appellant gave in para 7 of the plaint an illustration of the extinction of a line, no Chela having been left therein and the consequent devolution of succession upon the remaining lines:--
4. The Respondent 1 disputed this claim of the Appellant. The rule of succession was propounded by him in paragraph 4 of his written statement as under:--
5. The parties went to trial on the basis of these pleadings and the main contest between them turned on what was the rule of succession in regard to this institution. The trial court held that the custom set up by the Appellant was proved, viz., that the Gaddi of Bhaironji and the rights to Puja and to offerings in Mandir Kalkaji as well as the property attached to that institution, and the land in the village Bahapur devolved from 'Guru' to 'Chela'; in case there was no Chela, the Gurbhai of the last Mahant succeeded and if none of them was available and the line became extinct, the above rights devolved upon the surviving line.
The Appellant was accordingly found to be the rightful claimant to the Gaddi and rights and interests of Sandhiya Nath in both the above religious institutions and to lands in village Bahapur. The suit was, therefore, decreed in favour of the Appellant with costs.
6. The Respondent 1 took an appeal to the Court of the District Judge, Delhi, and the District Judge, Delhi, accepted the conclusion of the trial Court in regard to the rule of succession, dismissed the appeal and confirmed the decree passed by the trial court in favour of the Appellant though it varied the order of costs ordering both the parties to bear their own costs in both the Courts.
A second appeal was filed by Respondent 1 against this decision of the District Judge, Delhi, in the High Court of Judicature for the State of Punjab at Simla. This appeal was heard by a single Judge who also confirmed the decision of the trial court and dismissed the appeal with costs throughout. The Respondent 1 filed a Letters Patent appeal against this decision of the single Judge.
The Division Bench, hearing the Letters Patent appeal, came to a contrary conclusion, held that the Appellant had not proved the custom set up by him and allowed the appeal dismissing the Appellant's suit with costs throughout. This Appeal was filed by the Appellant against that decision of the Division Bench of the High Court of Judicature for the State of Punjab at Simla on a certificate granted by the High Court under Article 133 of the Constitution.
7. The only point which arises for consideration before us is whether the Appellant has succeeded in proving the rule of succession propounded by him in the plaint.
8. It may be observed at the outset that Respondent 1 failed to prove the rule of succession which he set out in para 4 of his written statement and the finding reached by the trial court, in this behalf that there has never been any election to the office of Mahant in these institutions was not challenged in the Court of the District Judge, Delhi, nor before the High Court.
Mr. Achhru Ram appearing before us for Respondent 1 also did not challenge that finding with the result that that contention must be taken as negatived. The Appellant has, however, got to succeed on the strength of his own title and not on the infirmity of that of Respondent 1 and he has, therefore, got to establish the rule of succession propounded by him in paras 4 and 6 of the plaint.
The elective principle having been negatived it can be safely assumed that the succession to the estate in these lines of descent from Balak Nath was hereditary and it devolved from 'Guru' to 'Chela'. As a matter of fact, the findings reached by the District Judge, Delhi, in regard to the succession in these three lines go to establish that the rule of succession was from 'Guru' to 'Chela'. The facts found by him were as under: --
9. What happens when a particular line becomes extinct has, however, been the subject-matter of divergent opinions between the two lower Courts and the High Court in Second Appeal on the one hand and the Letters Patent Bench on the other. All the three Courts who came to the conclusion in favour of the Appellant in this behalf were of the opinion that the extinction of the line of Sehaj Nath on the death of Bhola Nath afforded an instance of the second part of the rule of succession propounded by the Appellant, viz., that on the extinction of a line, no Chela having been left therein, Succession devolved upon the remaining lines.
The extinction of a line could take place only once and such occurrences would be very rare. Under these circumstances, even one instance of that type would be enough to establish the rule of succession as propounded. The only thing which weighed with the Letters Patent Bench in arriving at a contrary conclusion was the alleged admission made by the Advocate of the Appellant that "as regards this part of the custom which he was propagating in respect of his client there was not a single instance and that in the course of the last 100 or more years since this temple came into existence there was no such occasion for such a custom which he was propounding to be in operation"
Having regard to the finding reached by the trial Court which finding was not challenged by the Appellant before the District Judge, Delhi, or before the High Court that Respondent 1 was the Chela of Phul Nath who belonged to the line of Maya Nath, it came to the conclusion that there was a Chela in that line and, therefore, the line could not be extinct.
10. We are, however, unable to accept this reasoning of the Letters Patent Bench. If the succession was from 'Guru' to 'Chela' and the question was whether a Chela or Chelas were in a position to succeed to the Guru, that question could be determined with reference to the position as it obtained at the time when the succession to the property of that Guru opened out and the only Chela or Chelas who could succeed to the property could be the Chelas of that Guru whose property was to devolve upon them.
The Chelas of any earlier Guru, whatever their spiritual affinity may be, could never be thought of in this connection. We are fortified in this conclusion by the events that happened in 1918. When Bhola Nath, the last representative of the line of Sehaj Nath died on 10th April, 1918, the only two persons who claimed to inherit his estate as on the extinction of his line and the devolution of succession to the surviving lines were Pancham Nath and Sandhiya Nath.
Phul Nath, the Guru of Respondent 1 was then alive and if propinquity of relation ship in this spiritual descent which we are concerned with was the criterion of the right to inheritance, Phul Nath was certainly nearer in relationship than Sandhiya Nath and he could have claimed to inherit the property of Bhola Nath to the extent of the 1/2 share therein along with Pancham Nath.
No such claim was, however, made by Phul Nath and Sandhiya Nath, as the representative of the line of Maya Nath was the only person who made such claim for inheritance and was recognized as the heir of Bhola Nath along with Pancham Nath when mutation came to be made.
This goes to show that the succession from 'Guru' to 'Chela' only means the devolution of property from the last representative of the line to his Chela and when one talks of the succession from one Chela, on his death, to another Chela, it is also to another Chela of the Guru who is the last representative of the line. When one talks similarly of the extinction of the line, it only means that when the last representative of that particular line dies without leaving a Chela or Chelas or a Gurbhai who could succeed to his estate that line becomes extinct and one has not got to go backwards in order to ascertain whether there is any Chela of any Guru in that line at all surviving.
We are, therefore, of the opinion that on the death of Sandhiya Nath, his Chelas Shanker Nath, Hardwari Nath and Badlu Nath succeeded to the properties left by him one after the other and that when Badlu Nath died there was neither his Chela or any Gurbhai of his who could succeed to the properties with the result that there was no succession possible in that line from 'Guru' to 'Chela' and the line became extinct.
11. It was, however, urged by Mr. Achhru Ram that unless the Appellant proved that when Bhola Nath died on 10th April, 1918, there were Chelas existing in the line of Sehaj Nath & yet the line of Sehaj Nath was treated as extinct and the succession devolved upon Pancham Nath and Sandhiya Nath who represented the two surviving lines of Sahib Nath and Maya Nath, the second part of the rule of succession propounded by the Appellant could not be held proved.
The answer to this contention was furnished by the District Judge, Delhi in his judgment when he observed that it was admitted that Sehaj Nath had three Chelas and it was improbable that the other two Chelas who did not succeed had no Chela of their own; nor was it very probable that Sanwat Nath and Shiv Nath in turn had no other Chelas apart from their own who actually succeeded.
The evidence was that these Jogis had the habit of initiating several Chelas. Respondent 1 himself admitted that Naina Nath had as many as twenty Chelas and there was evidence of another witness also. It was, therefore, probable that the line of Sehaj Nath was taken to be extinct not because there was no Chela but because the last Mahant, i.e. Bhola Nath had no Chela of his own nor was any Gurbhai of his nor a Chela of a Gurbhai.
Another circumstance relied upon by the learned Dist. Judge in support of this position was that in the disputed line there were other Chelas actually living & one of them, Har Nath had given evidence as the witness of Respondent 1. He was the Chela of Misri Nath and thus nearer in spiritual relationship to the last Mahant than Respondent 1: yet Har Nath had never made any claim to the Gaddi that was now in dispute although if the case of Respondent 1 was well-founded Har Nath was entitled to the Gaddi in preference to him.
The reason could only have been that Har Nath knew that not being the Chela of the last Mahant nor the Chela of the Gurbhai he had no claim.
12. We are in accord with this reasoning adopted by the learned District Judge and we endorse the conclusion to which he reached after taking all these factors into consideration that the rule of succession propounded on behalf of the Appellant was the rule of succession governing these institutions, i.e., a Mahant is succeeded by his Chela or his Gurbhai or the Chela of that Gurbhai and failing such claimants the line is deemed extinct and succession goes to the representative of the other line.
13. This is sufficient to dispose of the Appeal and we need not discuss the other points which were adverted to in the judgment of the Letters Patent Bench. On a consideration of all the circumstances of the case we have come to the conclusion that there was no vagueness or indefiniteness in the rule of succession propounded by the Appellant in paras 4 and 6 of the plaint, that the custom propounded therein has been established by the Appellant and the conclusion which was reached by the Letters Patent Bench to the contrary was incorrect.
We accordingly allow the Appeal, set aside the judgment of the Letters Patent Bench and restore the decree passed by the trial Court in favour of the Appellant with costs payable by Respondent 1 throughout.	Total Judgement
