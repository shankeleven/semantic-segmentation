1959. November 25. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SARKAR J.-There are five appellants before us. Four of them were employees of a company called the Indian Iron & Steel Co., Ltd. and the fifth an outsider.
The appellants were convicted by a Magistrate of Asansol in West Bengal, of an offence under s. 27 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, hereinafter referred to as the Act, for having instigated and incited others to take 'art in an illegal strike. Each appellant was sentenced to simple imprisonment for three months. On appeal by the appellants, the learned Additional Sessions Judge of Asansol, confirmed the order of the learned Magistrate. A petition to the High Court at Calcutta against the order of the learned Additional Sessions Judge by way of revision also failed. The appellants have now appealed to this Court with special leave. The respondent to this appeal is the State of West Bengal and the Company has been allowed to intervene. The Company owns a factory at Burnpur near Asansol in which there is a Sheet Mill. The factory was declared by the Government to be a public utility service. There was a slow-down strike in the Hot Mill section of the Sheet Mill. The Company thereupon issued charge-sheets to some of its workers, including the four appellants in its employment, for taking part in the slow-down strike and instigating others to join it as also for other misconduct and after an enquiry, dismissed these four appellants from service. On such dismissal the slow-down strike gained in strength. Thereupon, on April 8, 1953, the Company issued a notice to the workers of the Hot Mill the relevant portion of which is set out below:
As a result of this notice forty workers of the Hot Mill recorded their willingness but the rest, who were about three hundred in number, did not make any response at all. In fact, on April 11, 1953, the workers in the entire Sheet Mill numbering about one thousand and three hundred, went on a sit-down strike which lasted till April 20, 1953. On April 25, 1953, the Company issued another notice to the workers which is set out below:	Facts
It seems to us that to construe the definition as including a discharge would be against the entire tenor of the Act and also against the meaning of a lock-out as understood in industrial relations.	RespArg
We may also state that there is no evidence that prior to 2 p.m. of April 10, 1953, any employee had been prevented by the Company from attending to his duty.
The next question is whether a discharge of employees by an employer amounts to a lock-out. It is said that the words used in the definition of a lock-out, namely, "the refusal by an employer to continue to employ any number of persons employed by him' cover the discharge of employees by an employer. The contention so raised was rejected by the Labour Appellate Tribunal in Presidency Jute Mills. Co. Ltd. v. Presidency Jute Mills Co. Employees Union (1). We are in entire agreement with the view there expressed.	Precedent
After this notice the workers of the entire factory, except those engaged in essential services, went on a strike on April 27,1953, which lasted for twenty two hours. On May 19, 1953, the Company filed a complaint under s. 27 of the Act with the sanction of the Government granted on May 2, 1953. Out of this complaint the present appeal arises. The respondent's case is that the strikes of April 11, to April 20, 1953, and April 27, 1953, were illegal and the appellants had instigated them. The appellants have not in this Court challenged the finding of the Courts below that the strikes took place and that they had instigated them, but they contend that the strikes were not illegal. Section 27 of the Act provides that a person who instigates or incites others to take part in, or otherwise acts in furtherance of a strike, which is illegal under the Act, commits an offence. The respondent's case is that the strikes were illegal under s. 24(1) of the Act which provides that a strike or a lock-out shall be illegal if it is commenced or declared in contravention of s. 22. There is no dispute that the strikes were in contravention of s.
22. The appellants rely on s. 24(3) of the Act under which a strike declared in consequence of an illegal lock-out shall not be deemed to be illegal and say that the strikes had been in consequence of an illegal lock-out by the Company of the three hundred workers of the Hot Mill by the notices of April 8, and April 25. It is clear that if there was such a lock-out, it was illegal under s. 24(1) for it would be clearly in contravention of s. 22.
The question then is, was there a lock-out by the Company? The learned Advocate for the appellants first contends that the notices use the same words as are used in the definition of a lock-out in s. 2(1) of the Act and therefore by those notices the Company locked-out the men. We think that this argument is unfounded. The definition so far as is material reads, " lock-out means the refusal by an employer to continue to employ any number of persons employ- ed by him." In the notices the words are " considered to be no longer employed " while the definition uses the words "
By virtue of s. 22 of the Act, in a public utility ,service no worker can go on strike nor can an employer lock-out his workmen without giving notice of strike or of lock-out within six weeks before the strike or lock-out as the case may be or within fourteen days of such notice or before the date fixed in such notice or during the pendency of any conciliation proceedings before a conciliation officer and seven days after the conclusion thereof. Section 23 prohibits strikes and lock-outs in other industrial establishments during the pendency of conciliation proceedings before a Board and for seven days thereafter. Section 24(1) makes a strike and a lock-out in contravention of ss. 10, 22 and 23, illegal. Section 24(2) provides that a strike declared in consequence of an illegal lock-out and a lock-out declared in consequence of an illegal strike shall not be illegal. Section 25 prohibits the spending of money on illegal strikes and lock-outs.
The Act therefore treats strikes and lock-outs on the same basis; it treats one as the counterpart of the other. A strike is a weapon of the workers while a lock-out that of the employer. A strike does not, of course, contemplate the severance of the relation of employer and employed; it would be strange in these circumstances if a lock-out did so. Under the provisions of s. 22, a lock-out cannot be declared in a public utility service immediately; it can be declared only after the date fixed in the notice and cannot be declared within fourteen days of the giving of the notice. Now, if a discharge is included in a (1) [1952] L A.C. 62.
lock-out, an employer in such a service cannot discharge his employee, except after the time specified. Now, that would often make it impossible for the employer to carry on his business. It is conceivable that an employee may be guilty of such misconduct that his immediate discharge is essential. Indeed., there is no reason to think that such cases would be very infrequent. In such a case if an employer is prevented on pain of being made criminally liable under s. 27 from discharging the employee forthwith, irreparable mischief may be caused to his works or serious personal injury -to himself or his other employees. We have no reason to think that the Act intended such a result. Again, if a lock-out included a discharge, then there would be a conflict between ss. 22 and 23 on the one hand and s. 33 on the other. As has already been stated, ss. 22 and 23 prohibit a lock-out of workers during the pendency of the conciliation proceedings, therein mentioned, and seven days thereafter. According to the interpretation suggested by the learned Advocate for the appellants, during this time no worker could at all be discharged for a lock-out includes a discharge, it being remembered that the prohibition in the section is absolute. Under s. 33 however, an employer is prohibited during the pendency of a conciliation proceeding, from discharging a workman concerned in the dispute for any misconduct connected with such dispute save with the express permission of the authority before whom the proceeding is pending. So if a lock out includes a discharge, under ss. 22 and 23 there can be no discharge during the conciliation proceedings while under s. 33 there could be one with the permission of the authority conducting the proceeding. If a discharge amounted to a lock-out, an absurd result would thus be produced.
By an amendment made on October 2, 1953, certain provisions have been introduced into the Act which would show clearly that a lock-out as defined in s. 2(1), which section has been left unaltered by the amendment, was never intended to include a discharge of workmen. We refer first to s. 2(oo) by which a new definition was introduced in the Act which, so far as is necessary for the present purpose, is in these words:
be accepted by the latter collectively. Therefore, inour opinion, the rules of interpretation do not prevent us from giving to the words used in the definition the meaning " a refusal by the employer to allow any number of persons employed by him to attend to their duties without effecting a termination of service as was done in the Presidency Jute Mills Co's case (1), which would avoid one part of the Act coming in conflict with another. The last point raised is about the propriety of the sanction. Section 34(1) of the Act provides, No court shall take cognisance of any offence punishable under this Act save on complaint made by or under the authority of the ap. propriate Government. The learned Advocate for the appellants relying on Gokalchand Dwarkadas Morarka v. The King (2), where a provision somewhat similar to s. 34(1) was considered by the Judicial Committee, contended that the sanction granted in the present case by the Government of the West Bengal to file the complaint against the appellants was bad as it had been granted without reference to the facts constituting the offence. It is true that the sanction does not on the face of it refer to the facts constituting the offence. There is, however, ample evidence in this case, which we did not understand the learned Advocate for the appellants to challenge and which clearly establishes that the entire facts connected with the offence had been placed before the sanctioning authority and the sanction had been granted on a consideration of them. The Judicial committee in the case above-mentioned itself observed that the sanction would be good if it was proved by evidence that it had been granted after all the necessary facts had been placed before the sanctioning authority though these facts might not have been stated on the face of the sanction itself. It therefore seems to us that the sanction in the present case is unobjectionable.	Section
We feel, therefore, that the appeal must fail. We think it right however in the circumstances of this case and in view of the long lapse of time since the (1) [1952] L.A.C. 62. (1948) L.R. 75 I.A. 30.
case started, to modify the sentence passed. In our view, a sentence of simple imprisonment for the period already served and a fine of Rs. 100 with simple imprisonment for a period of fifteen days in default of payment of the fine for each appellant will be sufficient in this case and we order accordingly.
Subject to this modification of the sentence, this appeal is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.	Conclusion

1959. November 25. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SARKAR J.-There are five appellants before us. Four of them were employees of a company called the Indian Iron & Steel Co., Ltd. and the fifth an outsider.
The appellants were convicted by a Magistrate of Asansol in West Bengal, of an offence under s. 27 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, hereinafter referred to as the Act, for having instigated and incited others to take 'art in an illegal strike. Each appellant was sentenced to simple imprisonment for three months. On appeal by the appellants, the learned Additional Sessions Judge of Asansol, confirmed the order of the learned Magistrate. A petition to the High Court at Calcutta against the order of the learned Additional Sessions Judge by way of revision also failed. The appellants have now appealed to this Court with special leave. The respondent to this appeal is the State of West Bengal and the Company has been allowed to intervene. The Company owns a factory at Burnpur near Asansol in which there is a Sheet Mill. The factory was declared by the Government to be a public utility service. There was a slow-down strike in the Hot Mill section of the Sheet Mill. The Company thereupon issued charge-sheets to some of its workers, including the four appellants in its employment, for taking part in the slow-down strike and instigating others to join it as also for other misconduct and after an enquiry, dismissed these four appellants from service. On such dismissal the slow-down strike gained in strength. Thereupon, on April 8, 1953, the Company issued a notice to the workers of the Hot Mill the relevant portion of which is set out below:
As a result of this notice forty workers of the Hot Mill recorded their willingness but the rest, who were about three hundred in number, did not make any response at all. In fact, on April 11, 1953, the workers in the entire Sheet Mill numbering about one thousand and three hundred, went on a sit-down strike which lasted till April 20, 1953. On April 25, 1953, the Company issued another notice to the workers which is set out below:
After this notice the workers of the entire factory, except those engaged in essential services, went on a strike on April 27,1953, which lasted for twenty two hours. On May 19, 1953, the Company filed a complaint under s. 27 of the Act with the sanction of the Government granted on May 2, 1953. Out of this complaint the present appeal arises. The respondent's case is that the strikes of April 11, to April 20, 1953, and April 27, 1953, were illegal and the appellants had instigated them. The appellants have not in this Court challenged the finding of the Courts below that the strikes took place and that they had instigated them, but they contend that the strikes were not illegal. Section 27 of the Act provides that a person who instigates or incites others to take part in, or otherwise acts in furtherance of a strike, which is illegal under the Act, commits an offence. The respondent's case is that the strikes were illegal under s. 24(1) of the Act which provides that a strike or a lock-out shall be illegal if it is commenced or declared in contravention of s. 22. There is no dispute that the strikes were in contravention of s.
22. The appellants rely on s. 24(3) of the Act under which a strike declared in consequence of an illegal lock-out shall not be deemed to be illegal and say that the strikes had been in consequence of an illegal lock-out by the Company of the three hundred workers of the Hot Mill by the notices of April 8, and April 25. It is clear that if there was such a lock-out, it was illegal under s. 24(1) for it would be clearly in contravention of s. 22.
The question then is, was there a lock-out by the Company? The learned Advocate for the appellants first contends that the notices use the same words as are used in the definition of a lock-out in s. 2(1) of the Act and therefore by those notices the Company locked-out the men. We think that this argument is unfounded. The definition so far as is material reads, " lock-out means the refusal by an employer to continue to employ any number of persons employ- ed by him." In the notices the words are " considered to be no longer employed " while the definition uses the words "
The circumstances which led to the issuing of the notice of April 25 also show that the workers had actually been discharged on April 10. What had happened was that the Labour Minister of the Government of West Bengal had intervened in the dispute between the Company and its workers. He met the workers and on April 21, 1953, that is, after the termination of the first of the two strikes, suggested certain terms for the settlement of the dispute. His suggestion was that " if the workers of the Hot Mills, who stand discharged from 2 p.m. of April 10, 1953, as a consequence of their disregarding the notice issued on 8th April, 1953, report themselves for duty immediately and record their willingness to operate the plant to its normal capacity, the Government would recommend their reinstatement to the Management." A copy of this suggestion was forwarded to the Company by the Government with a request to implement the recommendations contained in it with a further request to give the suggestion a wide publicity. The company circulated the Labour Minister's suggestion among the workers and to comply with his request to implement it, it issued the notice of April 25, to which a copy of the suggestion was attached. It is, therefore, clear that all that the Company intended to do by the notice of April 25, was to comply with the Government's suggestion and so to cancel the discharge of the workers of the Hot Mill which had already taken effect and reinstate them in their former employments if the workers carried out their part of the suggestion. This notice, therefore, does not support the contention that the workers had not been discharged till April 28, 1953.
We may also state that there is no evidence that prior to 2 p.m. of April 10, 1953, any employee had been prevented by the Company from attending to his duty.
The next question is whether a discharge of employees by an employer amounts to a lock-out. It is said that the words used in the definition of a lock-out, namely, "the refusal by an employer to continue to employ any number of persons employed by him' cover the discharge of employees by an employer. The contention so raised was rejected by the Labour Appellate Tribunal in Presidency Jute Mills. Co. Ltd. v. Presidency Jute Mills Co. Employees Union (1). We are in entire agreement with the view there expressed.
It seems to us that to construe the definition as including a discharge would be against the entire tenor of the Act and also against the meaning of a lock-out as understood in industrial relations.
By virtue of s. 22 of the Act, in a public utility ,service no worker can go on strike nor can an employer lock-out his workmen without giving notice of strike or of lock-out within six weeks before the strike or lock-out as the case may be or within fourteen days of such notice or before the date fixed in such notice or during the pendency of any conciliation proceedings before a conciliation officer and seven days after the conclusion thereof. Section 23 prohibits strikes and lock-outs in other industrial establishments during the pendency of conciliation proceedings before a Board and for seven days thereafter. Section 24(1) makes a strike and a lock-out in contravention of ss. 10, 22 and 23, illegal. Section 24(2) provides that a strike declared in consequence of an illegal lock-out and a lock-out declared in consequence of an illegal strike shall not be illegal. Section 25 prohibits the spending of money on illegal strikes and lock-outs.
The Act therefore treats strikes and lock-outs on the same basis; it treats one as the counterpart of the other. A strike is a weapon of the workers while a lock-out that of the employer. A strike does not, of course, contemplate the severance of the relation of employer and employed; it would be strange in these circumstances if a lock-out did so. Under the provisions of s. 22, a lock-out cannot be declared in a public utility service immediately; it can be declared only after the date fixed in the notice and cannot be declared within fourteen days of the giving of the notice. Now, if a discharge is included in a (1) [1952] L A.C. 62.
lock-out, an employer in such a service cannot discharge his employee, except after the time specified. Now, that would often make it impossible for the employer to carry on his business. It is conceivable that an employee may be guilty of such misconduct that his immediate discharge is essential. Indeed., there is no reason to think that such cases would be very infrequent. In such a case if an employer is prevented on pain of being made criminally liable under s. 27 from discharging the employee forthwith, irreparable mischief may be caused to his works or serious personal injury -to himself or his other employees. We have no reason to think that the Act intended such a result. Again, if a lock-out included a discharge, then there would be a conflict between ss. 22 and 23 on the one hand and s. 33 on the other.

So if a lock out includes a discharge, under ss. 22 and 23 there can be no discharge during the conciliation proceedings while under s. 33 there could be one with the permission of the authority conducting the proceeding. If a discharge amounted to a lock-out, an absurd result would thus be produced.
By an amendment made on October 2, 1953, certain provisions have been introduced into the Act which would show clearly that a lock-out as defined in s. 2(1), which section has been left unaltered by the amendment, was never intended to include a discharge of workmen. We refer first to s. 2(oo) by which a new definition was introduced in the Act which, so far as is necessary for the present purpose, is in these words:

Therefore, inour opinion, the rules of interpretation do not prevent us from giving to the words used in the definition the meaning " a refusal by the employer to allow any number of persons employed by him to attend to their duties without effecting a termination of service as was done in the Presidency Jute Mills Co's case (1), which would avoid one part of the Act coming in conflict with another. The last point raised is about the propriety of the sanction. Section 34(1) of the Act provides, No court shall take cognisance of any offence punishable under this Act save on complaint made by or under the authority of the ap. propriate Government. The learned Advocate for the appellants relying on Gokalchand Dwarkadas Morarka v. The King (2), where a provision somewhat similar to s. 34(1) was considered by the Judicial Committee, contended that the sanction granted in the present case by the Government of the West Bengal to file the complaint against the appellants was bad as it had been granted without reference to the facts constituting the offence. It is true that the sanction does not on the face of it refer to the facts constituting the offence. There is, however, ample evidence in this case, which we did not understand the learned Advocate for the appellants to challenge and which clearly establishes that the entire facts connected with the offence had been placed before the sanctioning authority and the sanction had been granted on a consideration of them. The Judicial committee in the case above-mentioned itself observed that the sanction would be good if it was proved by evidence that it had been granted after all the necessary facts had been placed before the sanctioning authority though these facts might not have been stated on the face of the sanction itself. It therefore seems to us that the sanction in the present case is unobjectionable.
We feel, therefore, that the appeal must fail. We think it right however in the circumstances of this case and in view of the long lapse of time since the (1) [1952] L.A.C. 62. (1948) L.R. 75 I.A. 30.
case started, to modify the sentence passed. In our view, a sentence of simple imprisonment for the period already served and a fine of Rs. 100 with simple imprisonment for a period of fifteen days in default of payment of the fine for each appellant will be sufficient in this case and we order accordingly.
Subject to this modification of the sentence, this appeal is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.	Total Judgement
