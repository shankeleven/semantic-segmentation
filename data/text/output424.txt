Zaverbhai Amaidas vs The State Of Bombay on 8 October, 1954	Case Title
CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 31 of 1953.
Under article 132(1) of the Constitution of India from the Judgment and Order dated 20-1-1953 of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in Criminal Revision Application No. 642 of 1952,
1. C. Dalal and P. K. Chatterjee for the appellant. M. C. Setalvad, Attorney-General of India (P. A. Mehta and P. G. Gokhale, with him) for the respondent. 1954. October 8. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMA AYYAR J.-This is an appeal against the judgment of the High Court of Bombay dismissing a revision petition filed by the appellant against his conviction under section 7 of the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act No. XXIV of 1946.
In the present case, there was no express repeal of the Bombay Act by Act No. LII of 1950 in terms of the proviso to article 254(2). Then the only question to be decided is whether the amendments made to the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act by the Central Legislature in 1948, 1949 and 1950 are "furthers (1) [1896] A.C. 348.
It is true, as already pointed out, that on a question under article 254(1) whether an Act of Parliament prevails against a law of the State, no question of repeal arises; but the principle on which the rule of implied repeal rests, namely, that if the subject-matter of the later legislation is identical with that of the earlier, so that they cannot both stand together, then the earlier is repealed by the later enactment, will be equally applicable to a question under article 254(2) whether the further legislation by Parliament is in respect of the same matter as that of the State law. We must accordingly hold that section 2 of Bombay Act No. XXXVI of 1947 cannot prevail as against section 7 of the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act No. XXIV of 1946 as amended by Act No. LII of 1950.	Issue
The charge against the appellant was that on 6th April, 1951, he had transported 15 maunds of juwar from his village of Khanjroli to Mandvi without a permit, and had thereby contravened section 5(1) of the Bombay Food Grains (Regulation of Movement and Sale) Order, 1949. The Resident First Class Magistrate of Bardoli who tried the case found him guilty, and sentenced him to imprisonment till the rising of the Court and a fine of Rs. 500. The conviction and sentence were both affirmed by the Sessions Judge, Surat, on appeal. The appellant thereafter took up the matter in revision to the High Court of Bombay, and there for the first time, took the objection that the Resident First Class Magistrate had no jurisdiction to try the case, because under section 2 of the Bombay Act No. XXXVI of 1947 the offence was punishable with imprisonment, which might extend to seven years, and under the Second Schedule to the Criminal Procedure Code, it was only the Sessions Court that had jurisdiction to try such offence. The answer of the State to this contention was that subsequent to the enactment of the Bombay Act No. XXXVI of 1947, the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act bad undergone substantial alterations, and was finally recast by the Central Act No. LII of 1950; that the effect of these amendments was that Act No. XXXVI of 1947 had become inoperative, that the governing Act was Act No. LII of 1950, and that as under	Facts
The appellant also sought to argue that the subjectmatter of the legislation in Act No. XXXVI of 1947 was exclusively in the Provincial List, and that section 107(2) of the Government of India Act and article 254(2) of the Constitution which apply only with reference to legislation on subjects which are in the Concurrent List, have no application. The very legislation on which the appellant relies, viz., Act No. XXXVI of 1947, proceeds, as already stated, on the basis that the subject-matter is in the Concurrent List. The appellant raised this question before the learned Judges of the Bombay High Court, and they rejected it. In the application for, leave to appeal to (1) [1937]1 K.B. 5I8.	PetArg
It is now necessary to refer in chronological sequence to the statutes bearing on the question. We start with the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act No. XXIV of 1946 enacted by the Central Legislature by virtue of the powers conferred on it by 9 and 10, George VI, Chapter 39. It applied to the whole of British India. Section 3 of the Act conferred power on the Central Government to issue orders for regulating the production, supply and distribution of essential commodities, and under section 4, this power could be delegated to the Provincial Government. Section 7(1) provided for punishment for contravention of orders issued under the Act, and ran as follows:
The State of Bombay considered that the maximum punishment of three years' imprisonment provided in the above section was not adequate for offences under the Act, and with the object of enhancing the punishment provided therein, enacted Act No. XXXVI of 1947. Section 2 of the said Act provided (omitting what is not material for the present purpose) that "Notwithstanding anything contained in the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946, whoever contravenes an order made or deemed to be made under section 3 of the said Act shall be punished with imprisonment which may extend to seven years, but shall not, except for reasons to be recorded in writing, be less than six months, and shall also be liable to fine." This section is avowedly repugnant to section 7(1) of the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act. Section 107 (2) of the Government of India Act, which was the Constitution Act then in force, enacted that, "Where a Provincial law with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent Legislative List contains any provision repugnant to the provisions of an earlier Dominion law or an existing law with respect to that matter, then, if the Provincial law having been reserved for the consideration of the Governor-General has received the assent of the Governor-General, the Provincial law shall in that Province prevail, but nevertheless the Dominion Legislature may at any time enact further legislation -with respect to the same matter. "
The Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act was again amended in 1949. Under this amendment, the proviso to section 7(i) was repealed, and a new clause substituted in the following terms:
Then came Central Act No. LII of 1950, under which the old section 7 was repealed and a new section enacted in the following terms:
Explanation:-A person in possession of foodgrain which does not exceed by more than five maunds the maximum quantity so prescribed shall not be deemed to be guilty of an offence punishable under the proviso to this sub-section. (3)If any person contravenes any order under section 3 relating to any essential commodity other than cotton textiles and food-stuffs, he shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine or with both, and if the order so provides, any property in respect of which the Court is satisfied that the order has been contravened may be forfeited to the Government.
(4)If any person to whom a direction is given under sub- section (4) of section 3 fails to comply with the direction, he shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both." It must be mentioned that while the amendments of 1948 and 1949 were made when section 107(2) of the Government of India Act was in force, the Constitution of India Act had come into operation, when Act No. LII of 1950 was enacted. Article 254(2) of the Constitution is as follows:
This is, in substance, a reproduction of section 107(2) of the Government of India Act, the concluding portion thereof being incorporated in a proviso with further additions. Discussing the nature of the power of the Dominion Legislature, Canada, in relation to that of the Provincial Legislature, in a situation similar to that under section 107(2) of the Government of India Act, it was observed by Lord Was on in Attorney-General for Ontario v. Attornery- General for the Dominion(1), that though a law enacted by the Parliament of Canada and within its competence would override Provincial legislation covering the same field, the Dominion Parliament bad no authority conferred upon it under the Constitution to enact a statute repealing directly any Provincial statute. That would appear to have been the position under section 107(2) of the Government of India Act with reference to the subjects mentioned in the Concurrent List. Now, by the proviso to article 254(2) the Constitution has enlarged the powers of Parliament, and under that proviso, Parliament can do what the Central Legislature could not under section 107(2) of the Government of India Act, and enact a law adding to, amending, varying or repealing a law of the State, when it relates to a matter mentioned in the Concurrent List. The position then is that under the Constitution Parliament can, acting under the proviso to article 254(2), repeal a State law. But where it does not expressly do so, even then, the State law will be void under that provision if it conflicts with a later "law with respect to the same matter" that may be enacted by Parliament.

this Court which was presented under article 132(1), the only ground that was put forward as involving a substantial question as to the interpretation of the Constitution was, whether the Bombay Act No. XXXVI of 1947 was repugnant and void under article 254 of the Constitution. No other question having been raised in the petition, we must decline to permit the appellant to raise this point. In the result, the appeal fails and is dismissed. Appeal dismissed.	Conclusion
