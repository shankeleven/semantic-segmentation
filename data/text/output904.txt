According to the prosecution the canal after a temporary' closure restarted flowing on May 5, 1953. And although it was not his turn of water the deceased Shivlal was allowed to take the water to irrigate his fields. On May 6 the canal was flowing to its full capacity and Shivlal was to take his turn of water which was of 6 hours duration from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. but he watered his lands from 8 a.m. to 10-30 a.m. because the village diggi (pond) which was empty had to be filled up. Mirab Ram Karan P. W. 1 with the consent of Shivlal diverted the water for the purpose of filling up the diggi, promising him (Shivlal) to. get him the rest of his turn of water, i.e., for 3-1/2 hours after the diggi had been filled up. The diggi was filled up by 1 p.m. on the 7th. Shivlal then wanted to divert the water into his field but Bhagwandas prevented him from doing so claiming the turn to be his. According to Ram Karan Mirab P. W. I the turn of Bhagwandas was after Surta whose turn was next to that of Shivlal.
As Shivlal was prevented from taking his turn of water he started walking towards the village saying that he would go and speak to Mirab. Bhagwandas thereupon shouted that " the enemy was going " and hit Shivlal on the head with a kassi.

This occurrence was witnessed by Hazari P. W. 3 who was grazing his camels in the field of Surta. He went up to the place where the beating was going on and shouted to the assailants who "	Facts

If as observed by the learned Judges of the High Court, Hazari had mentioned the presence of Bega merely I because the latter was to be produced as a prosecution witness and because he (Hazari) had been asked to mention it, then it would detract so materially from his reliability that it would be dangerous to accept his testimony as being of any great value which is still more diminished by the finding as to the innocence of Mt. Rameshwari.' The other piece of evidence which the prosecution relied upon was the two dying declarations made by Shivlal to Gyaniram P. W. 4 and Jora P. W. 7. Besides the infirmities which the testimony of these two witnesses (Gyaniram P. W. 4 and Jora P. W. 1) suffered from due to material contradictions in their respective statements made at various stages of the case and which have been pointed out by the learned Sessions Judge who said about Gyaniram:	PetArg
The learned Judges have made the following significant observation in regard to Hazari:
Although this Court will not interfere with the findings of the High Court because its conclusions on the evidence as to the guilt or innocence of the accused differ from that of the High Court, yet where the evidence is such that no Tribunal could legitimately infer from it that the accused is guilty this court would set aside the conviction.

We would, therefore, allow this appeal, set aside the judgment of the Rajasthan High Court, restore that of the Sessions Judge and order the acquittal of the accused.
