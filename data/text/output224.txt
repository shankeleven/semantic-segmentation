1962. December 22. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.-These are petitions under article 32 of the Constitution of India for directions or orders or writs to enforce the fundaments rights, of the petitioners to property by prohibiting, the respondent, the State of Madhya Pradesh, from enforcing their alleged rights under the Madhya Pradesh Abolition of Proprietary Rights Act, 1950.
Petitions Nos. 232, 233, 286, 309 and 320 of 1951 relate to tendu leaves which grow in shrub jungles and which are used in the manufacture of beedis or country made cigarettes, a very extensive and competitive business carried on by some of the petitioners involving an outlay of one to two lakhs of rupees in some cases. For instance, 406 contracts are involved in Petition No. 232 of 1951 ; the consideration paid comes to Rs. 1,65,385 and the expenses are alleged to be in the region of Rs. 1,90,000. In Petition No. 233 of 1951 there are 785 contracts; the purchase money is Rs. 1,10,605 and the outlay byway of 'expenses is said to be Rs. 50,000.
Teak,, timber and hardwood form the subject-matter of the rights involved in Petition No. 350 of 1951 and the registered lease deed is dated 8th October, 1949, and it is for a term of ten years.	Issue
The several petitioners entered into contracts and agreements with the previous proprietors of certain estates and mahals in the State under which it is said they acquired the rights to pluck, collect and carry away tendu leaves, to cultivate, culture and acquire lac and to cut and carry away teak and timber and miscellaneous special of trees called hardwood and bamboos. The contracts and agreements are in 'writing some of them are registered. There is no dispute about their genuineness, and it has not been alleged that they are 'collusive or fraudulent transactions. Their dates and the several sums of money paid as consideration are set out in the petitions. The petitioners allege that they have spent large sums of money in the exercise of their rights, and his fact too is not controverted.
Petition No. 351 of 1952 involves tendu leaves and miscellaneous forest produce and timber. Petition No. 354 of 1951 relates to bamboo forests, and Petition No. 490 of 1951 to hardwood and bamboo. The contentions of the petitioners are mainly three in number. They say that the rights acquired by them under these contracts and agreements were got before the passing of the Madhya Pradesh Abolition of Proprietary Rights Act, 1950, and that the legislation therefore does not affect them. It is urged next that they are not proprietors within the meaning of the Act and consequently the Act does not apply to them. Lastly, the question is raised that the Act itself is ultra vires, as many of its material provisions offend their fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution. The full title of the Act is the " Madhya Pradesh, Abolition of Proprietary Rights (Estates, Mahals, Alienated Lands) Act, 1950 ", and it is Madhya Pradesh Act I of 1951. It came into force on 26th January, 1951. On the very next day, there was a notification under section 3 of the Act putting an end to all proprietary rights in estates, mahals and alienated villages and vesting the same in the State for the purposes of the State free of all encumbrances with effect from 31st March, 1952.

The validity of the Act was questioned by the affected proprietors in Visheshwar Rao v. The State of Madhya Pradesh (1) before this Court, and the Act was held to be valid. The petitioners are concluded.	Precedent
We have to consider only the other two points raised on behalf of the petitioners.It is clear from the provisions in the impugned Act that only those rights of the proprietor vest in the State which the proprietor had on the specified date. Section 3 provides that on and from a date to be specified by a notification by the State Government, all proprietary rights in an estate or mahal vesting in a proprietor shall pass from him to and vest in the State. The consequences of vesting are given in section 4 of the Act, and it is provided that the vesting will take place, notwithstanding anything. contained in any contract, grant or document or in any other law for the time being in force and save as otherwise provided in this Act. But this again deals only with the rights existing on the date of the notification the section is not retrospective. (1) [1952] S.C.R. 1029.
Clause (a) speaks of all rights,title and interest vesting in the proprietor or any person having interest in such propreitory right through the proprietor. Clause (b) is to this effect "all grants and confirmation Of title of or to land in the property so vesting Or Of or, to any right or privilege in respect of such property orland revenue in respect thereof shall, whether liable to resumption or not, determine;"
The words " after the date of vesting " are important. Sub-section (3) of section 4 says Nothing contained in subsection (1) shall operate as a bar to the recovery by the outgoing proprietor of any sum which becomes due to him-before the date of vesting by virtue of his proprietary rights and any such sum shall be recoverable by him by any- process of law which but for this Act would be available to him."
If the outgoing proprietor is entitled to, recover any sums as quid pro quo for what he has parted with under the transfer, it can only be on the basis that the transfer is a good and valid transaction unaffected by the Act. Section 6 is very material, and it is in these terms' (1) Except as provided in sub-section (2), the transfer of any right in the property 'Which is liable to vest in the state under this Act made by the proprietor at any time after the 16th March, 1950, shall,. as from the date of vesting, be void.
Under the Indian Sale of Goods Act, "goods" include growing crops, grass and things attached to or forming part of the land, which are agreed to be severed before sale or under the contract of sale notwithstanding the -definition of "immovable property " in section 3 (25) of the General Clauses Act of 1897. In Petition No. 232 of 1951 two sample agreements relating to tendu leaves are given as annexures A and B to the petitions. They may be quoted in extenso for a clear understanding of the nature of the right created. Exhibit A dated 16th November, 1950, is in these terms:	Section
(2) Where on the. application of the transferor or the transferee, the Deputy Commissioner is satisfied that any transfer of property referred to in subsection (1) was made by a proprietor in good faith and in the ordinary course of village management, he may declare that the transfer shall, not be void* after the date of vesting."
The goods covered by the present petitions are goods which have a potential existence, and according to the decisions discussed by the learned author, there can be a sale of a present right to the goods as soon as they come into existence. Whether title passes on the date of the contract itself or later is really dependent on the intention of the parties, and as already stated, in these petitions the stipulated consideration has passed from the transferees to the proprietors, and possession also has been taken. We hold that the respondent has no right to interfere with the rights of the several petitioners under the contracts and agreements in their favour set out in their petitions, and we hereby issue a writ prohibiting the State from interfering in any manner whatsoever with the enjoyment of those rights by the petitioners. In cases where the periods under the contracts have expired, or where the proprietors have ill to recover anything from the transferees after he date of vesting, the State will be at perfect liberty to assert and enforce its rights standing in the shoes of the proprietors. The respondent will pay the petitioners their respective costs. Petition allowed.

Petition No. 319 of 1951 relates to the culture and cultivation of lac, and there are several lease deeds of different dates enuring for different periods; two of them go up to the years 1966 and 1967.
Teak,, timber and hardwood form the subject-matter of the rights involved in Petition No. 350 of 1951 and the registered lease deed is dated 8th October, 1949, and it is for a term of ten years.
Petition No. 351 of 1952 involves tendu leaves and miscellaneous forest produce and timber. Petition No. 354 of 1951 relates to bamboo forests, and Petition No. 490 of 1951 to hardwood and bamboo. The contentions of the petitioners are mainly three in number. They say that the rights acquired by them under these contracts and agreements were got before the passing of the Madhya Pradesh Abolition of Proprietary Rights Act, 1950, and that the legislation therefore does not affect them. It is urged next that they are not proprietors within the meaning of the Act and consequently the Act does not apply to them. Lastly, the question is raised that the Act itself is ultra vires, as many of its material provisions offend their fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution. The full title of the Act is the " Madhya Pradesh, Abolition of Proprietary Rights (Estates, Mahals, Alienated Lands) Act, 1950 ", and it is Madhya Pradesh Act I of 1951. It came into force on 26th January, 1951. On the very next day, there was a notification under section 3 of the Act putting an end to all proprietary rights in estates, mahals and alienated villages and vesting the same in the State for the purposes of the State free of all encumbrances with effect from 31st March, 1952.
The validity of the Act was questioned by the affected proprietors in Visheshwar Rao v. The State of Madhya Pradesh (1) before this Court, and the Act was held to be valid. The petitioners are concluded.
We have to consider only the other two points raised on behalf of the petitioners.It is clear from the provisions in the impugned Act that only those rights of the proprietor vest in the State which the proprietor had on the specified date. Section 3 provides that on and from a date to be specified by a notification by the State Government, all proprietary rights in an estate or mahal vesting in a proprietor shall pass from him to and vest in the State. The consequences of vesting are given in section 4 of the Act, and it is provided that the vesting will take place, notwithstanding anything. contained in any contract, grant or document or in any other law for the time being in force and save as otherwise provided in this Act. But this again deals only with the rights existing on the date of the notification the section is not retrospective. (1) [1952] S.C.R. 1029.
Clause (a) speaks of all rights,title and interest vesting in the proprietor or any person having interest in such propreitory right through the proprietor. Clause (b) is to this effect "all grants and confirmation Of title of or to land in the property so vesting Or Of or, to any right or privilege in respect of such property orland revenue in respect thereof shall, whether liable to resumption or not, determine;"
The words " after the date of vesting " are important. Sub-section (3) of section 4 says Nothing contained in subsection (1) shall operate as a bar to the recovery by the outgoing proprietor of any sum which becomes due to him-before the date of vesting by virtue of his proprietary rights and any such sum shall be recoverable by him by any- process of law which but for this Act would be available to him."
If the outgoing proprietor is entitled to, recover any sums as quid pro quo for what he has parted with under the transfer, it can only be on the basis that the transfer is a good and valid transaction unaffected by the Act. Section 6 is very material, and it is in these terms' (1) Except as provided in sub-section (2), the transfer of any right in the property 'Which is liable to vest in the state under this Act made by the proprietor at any time after the 16th March, 1950, shall,. as from the date of vesting, be void.
(2) Where on the. application of the transferor or the transferee, the Deputy Commissioner is satisfied that any transfer of property referred to in subsection (1) was made by a proprietor in good faith and in the ordinary course of village management, he may declare that the transfer shall, not be void* after the date of vesting."
The date, 16th March, 1950, is probably the date when legislation on these lines was actively thought of, and sub- section (1) hits at transfers made after this date. This means that transfers before that date are not to be regarded as void. Even in the case of transfers after the said date, sub-section (2). provides that the Deputy Commissioner may declare that they .are not void after the date of vesting, provided they were made in good faith and in the ordinary course of management. , The scheme of the Act as can be gathered from the provisions referred to above makes it reasonably clear that whatever was done before 16th March, 1950, by the proprietors by way of transfer of rights is not to, be disturbed or affected, and that what vests in the State is what the proprietors had oil the vesting date. If the proprietor had any rights after the date of vesting which he could enforce against the transferee such as a lessee or a licensee, those rights would no doubt vest in the State. In all these petitions, the several contracts and, agreements were before the date of vesting, and many of them were prior even to the 16th March, 1950. The petitioners had taken possession of the subject-matter of the contracts, namely, tendu leaves, lac palsadies, teak, timber and hardwood, bamboos and miscellaneous forest produce.
Under the Indian Sale of Goods Act, "goods" include growing crops, grass and things attached to or forming part of the land, which are agreed to be severed before sale or under the contract of sale notwithstanding the -definition of "immovable property " in section 3 (25) of the General Clauses Act of 1897. In Petition No. 232 of 1951 two sample agreements relating to tendu leaves are given as annexures A and B to the petitions. They may be quoted in extenso for a clear understanding of the nature of the right created. Exhibit A dated 16th November, 1950, is in these terms:
The terms of Exhibit B dated 12th July, 1948, Emitting unnecessary portions are as follows:
There is nothing in the Act to affect the validity of the several contracts and agreements. The petitioner are neither proprietors within the meaning of the Act nor persons having any interest in the proprietary right through the proprietors. There is no provision in the Act which extinguishes their rights in favour of the State. 'What exactly is meant by a ,proprietary right " under the revenue laws has been (1).I.L.R. [1949] Nag. 892, pointed out at page 217 of Volume I of Baden Powell's Land Systems of British India, where he says:
The goods covered by the present petitions are goods which have a potential existence, and according to the decisions discussed by the learned author, there can be a sale of a present right to the goods as soon as they come into existence. Whether title passes on the date of the contract itself or later is really dependent on the intention of the parties, and as already stated, in these petitions the stipulated consideration has passed from the transferees to the proprietors, and possession also has been taken.
