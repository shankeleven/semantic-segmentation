Prem Singh And Ors. vs Deputy Custodian General, Evacuee ... on 24 May, 1957	Case Title
1. The appellants have filed this appeal on a certificate of fitness granted on 25th May 1956, by the High Court of Punjab under Article 133 of the Constitution. The appeal is directed against the judgment and order of the said High Court pronounced on 18th October 1955. By that order the said High Court dismissed the application made by the appellants to the said High Court under Article 226 praying for a writ in the nature of a writ of certiorari to call for the records and to quash the order of the Deputy Custodian General passed on 18th August 1953, whereby he cancelled the allotment of lands in the village of Ratauli, Tehsil Jagadhari, District Ambala, made to the appellants on 7th June 1950.
3. The respondent NO. 2 (N.R. Basra) is the grand son of one Rai Sahib Maya Bhan Batra (since deceased) who had migrated from Phularwan, Tehsil Bhahval in the District of Shahapur leaving behind about 543 acres of first class land irrigated by canal in the District of Sargodha. On 15th December 1947 36 acres of land were allotted to Rai Sahib Maya Bhan Batra in village Ratauli on a temporary basis. This temporary allotment of 36 acres was, however, reduced to an allotment of 12 acres, for at that time no single allotment was being made for more than 12 acres.
4. Respondents Nos. 3 and 4 -- Hargobind and Jai Kishan are the sons of L. Devan Chand Suri, who arc also refugees from Rawalpindi. They were entitled to an allotment of 175 acres in lieu of the lands they had left behind in Pakistan. They applied for allotment in the District of Karnal as unsatisfied claimants. After allotting 133 acres 15 1/4 units of land in village Ratauli there remained a balance of 93 acres still available in that village for allotment.
7. The appellants thereupon moved the Punjab High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution praying for a writ quashing the above order of the Deputy Custodian General. The application came up before a Single Judge, who by his order dated September 3, 1954, referred the matter to a Division Bench and the Division Bench in its turn on September 28, 1954, referred the following two questions to a Full Bench for a decision:
The Full Bench answered the first question in the negative and in answer to the second question held that "orders passed by either the Custodian or Custodian General in exercise of their powers under Section 26 or 27 cancelling allotments in pending cases regarding orders passed before 22nd July, 1952, were valid, even if passed by the Custodian before 13th February, 1952, and by the, Custodian General before 25th August, 1953.'' The matter then went back to the Division Bench which, in the light of the answers given by the Full Bench, found no ground torn interference and dismissed the appellant's writ petition. The High Court, however, gave a certificate of fitness for appeal to this Court with which the present appeal has been filed.	Issue
2. The events which led up to the present. appeal may now be briefly stated. The appellants are refugees from Rawalpindi. On the partition of the country the appellants migrated to India abandoning 273 acres 6 kanals of first grade land irrigated by perennial canals situate in Chalk No. 205/R-B., Tehsil Jaranwala, District Lyalpur. In 1947 the appellants were given two units of lands in two villages, Todarpur and Naharpur, in Tehsil Jagadhari, District Ambala on a temporary basis. At the time of quasi-permanent allotment in November 1949, the appellants were given 133 acres 15 1/4 units of land in two villages Khandua and Naharpur, which lands were of the second grade.
On 20th February 1950 the appellants allotment in Khandua was cancelled and the whole of 133 acres 15 1/4 units of land was allotted to them in village Naharpur. In order to accommodate a group of people known as Brij Lal group in village Naharpur the allotment made to the appellants was cancelled on 6th June 1950, and the appellants were directed by the Director General, Relief and Rehabilitation (Additional Custodian), hereinafter referred to as the Director General, to be shifted from village Naharpur to the villages of Jaurian and Kottarkhans in Tehsil Jagadhari in the District of Ambala, where the lands were of the first grade.
It appears that on 7th June 1950, the appellants went post-haste to the head quartets of the Relief and Rehabilitation department protesting against their eviction from Naharpur in view of the improvements alleged to have been made, by them in that village and prayed that they should be retained there. In this application the appellants did not pray for an allotment of land in village Ratauli. The Director General directed the Revenue Assistant to make a report on that application.
On the same date the Revenue Assistant promptly reported that the appellants were sitting allottees of village Naharpur, which was a village of second grade, that the appellants were entitled to first grade lands and that consequently they had been ordered to be shifted from the second grade village to the first grade villages of Jaurian and Kotarkhana in Tehsil Jagadhari. With these remarks he concluded the report with the word "submitted."
The extreme expedition with which the order of 6th June 1950 was cancelled and a fresh allotment was made in favour of the appellants in village Ratauli, which they did not ask for, evidently created some doubts in the mind of the Deputy Custodian General as to the regularity of the procedure when he made his order on 18th August 1953. Be that as it may, he did not decide the matter on the strength of such doubts.
On October 28, 1950, the Director General replied stating that the allotment that had been made in favour of the appellants should stand and that he had no objection if the allotment made in favour of other persons were cancelled. Accordingly the allotment of 93 acres to respondents 3 and 4 in village Ratauli was cancelled. The above cancellation, however, was rescinded and the land was restored to them.
On July 17, 1952, the Financial Commissioner as custodian rejected the application of Respondent No. 2. The Respondent No. 2 thereupon went in revision under Section 27 of the Administration of Evacuee Property Act (Act XXXI of 1950) Hereinafter referred to as the Act. This application was dealt with and disposed of by the Deputy Custodian General, who held that under the circumstances, the allotment in favour of the appellants in village Ratauli could not be allowed to stand.	Facts
8. Mr. Harnam Singh appearing in support of this appeal has not questioned the correctness of the answers given to either, of the questions by the Full Bench. He concedes that the Deputy Custodian General, while disposing of the revision petition on August 18, 1953, could exercise the same powers which the Financial Commissioner as the Custodian had on July 17, 1952, when he rejected the application of Respondent No 2. It wi11 be recalled that the order of allotment in favour of the appellants in village Ratauli was made on June 7, 1950.	PetArg
In view of this rumour the heirs of Rai Sahib Maya Bhan Batra became apprehensive that the allotment of 112.7 acres in the single name of Rai Sahib might be reduced and so B.L. Batra, a son of the Rai Sahib, made a representation on behalf of all the heirs of the Rai Sahib to the Director General that as they were three brothers and the share of each in 112.7 acres was only about 37 acres, their allotment of 112.7 acres should not be cancelled and that if the allotment for any reason was cancelled they should be accommodated in village Ratauli.
On August 31, 1950, the Director General allotted those 93 acres of land to Respondents NOS. 3 and 4 and the balance of 82 acres were allotted to him in two other villages Mahalanwali and Habibpur.
5. It appears that after the Railways had abandoned the project of building a workshop on the lands reserved for them, the Officer on Special Duty (AMBALA) wrote to the Director General Relief and Rehabilitation asking him to reserve the lands released by the Railways for accommodating those who had been ousted from Chandigarh, the new capital of the Punjab.
He also rejected the contention of the appellants that if anybody were to be evicted iron village Ratauli in order to accommodate the heirs of Rai Sahib Maya Bhan Batra, it should be Respondents Nos. 3 and 4 Hargobind and Jai Kishan, who had obtained their allotment in that village during the pendency of the dispute. The Deputy. Custodian General made the following order on August 18, 1953:
Accepting, without deciding that the Deputy Custodian General's powers in revision under Section 27 of the Act were strictly limited to the powers of the Custodian to cancel an allotment, what we have to do is to ascertain what powers of cancellation the Financial Commissioner, who was she Custodian, had on July 17, 1952, when he rejected the application, for according to learned counsel for the appellants the Deputy Custodian General could only exercise similar powers of cancellation while disposing of the application for revision of the order of the Financial Commissioner as the Custodian.
11. Learned counsel has enumerated the following errors, namely: -
(11a) The last point urged by learned counsel for the appellant is that if anybody is to be ousted from village Ratauli for accommodating the respondent No. 2, there is no reason why the appellants should be ousted and not the respondents Nos. 3 and 4. Learned counsel for the respondents Nos. 3 and 4 urged with considerable force that there are good grounds for not disturbing his clients.	RespArg
In the margin of this report, however, the following words were endorsed: "Area also is reserved for Railway Workshop in village Ratauli. If approved Prem Singh and Narain Singh may be allotted land in the village." It is not easily understandable how, if the land in village Ratauli was reserved for Railway Workshop, such reserved land could be recommended for allotment to the appellants. There is an endorsement by the Director General of the owed "Approved" on the same date.
10. Learned counsel for the appellants next contends that the order of the Deputy Custodian General is obviously wrong and is liable to be quashed by a writ in the nature of certiorari, because of such glaring errors apparent on the face of the record. In Hari Vishnu, v. Ahmad Ishaque, , a Full Bench of this Court, after referring to the various decisions of the English and Indian Courts, summarised the principles deducible there from in the following words:
Then after referring to the case of Rex v. Northumberland Compensation Appeal Tribunal; Ex parte Shaw, 1951-1 K B 711 (B) and Ors. cases and quoting the following passage from the judgment of Mukherjea J. in T. C. Basappa v. T. Nagappa, .
This Court held on the fourth point as follows:
These departmental instructions, on the appellants own showing in sub-para (viii) of para. 12 of their petition under Article 226, were not inflexible and were not adhered to rigidly and were merely in the nature of procedure and that the rehabilitation authorities had full authority and complete powers to mate allotment without adhering rigidly to the departmental instructions, e.g., the scheme of sub-allocation. It, therefore, does not lie in the mouth of the appellants to say, that these departmental instructions are law and that in the context of these departmental instructions it must be held that there is an error of law apparent on the face of the judgment.
The errors pointed out, if they are errors at all, are mostly errors of fact and even if the errors may by any stretch of argument be said to constitute errors of law, they are nothing more than mere errors of law, which may be corrected by a court of appeal but which do not reader, the order a "speaking order" showing a clear ignorance or disregard of the provisions of the law, so as to be amenable to correction by a writ of 'certiorari. There is, in our opinion, no substance in this contention.
In the first place, the appellants are bigger allottees and if anybody were to be disturbed, it must be the bigger allottees and not the smaller. Reference is made to page 84 of the Land Resettlement Manual and it is claimed that this rule has laid down a rule of equity of general application. In the next place the appellants and the respondents Nos. 3 and 4 both come from Rawalpindi and they can be re-settled in Ratauli only on sanction given by Financial Commissioner and reference is made to page 82, paragraph 7 of Chapter (iv) which lays down the principles of allocation.	Precedent
The second provision was again amended by the addition of the words "or Section 27" after the figure 28 and before the words "of the Act' on August 25, 1953, that is to say, seven days after the Deputy Custodian General made his order in revision under Section 27 Rule 14 (6) being thus acknowledged by learned counsel to be out of the way, it is not necessary at all for us to express any opinion on the correctness or otherwise of the answers given by the full Bench to the question referred to it.
9. The Administration of Evacuee Property Act, 1950 (Act XXXI of 1950), was passed on April 17, 1950. The Central Government on September 8, 1950 framed rules in exercise of the powers conferred on it by Section 56 of the Act. On that date Rule 14 Consisted of five clauses namely, the present Sub-rule 1 to Sub-rule (5) which, however, is not material for our present purpose.
In exercise of powers delegated by the Central Government under Sub-section 1 of Section 55 of the Act to make rules under Clause 1 of Sub-section (2) of Section 56 of the said Act, the Punjab Government on August 29, 1951 promulgated, amongst other things the following rule, in substitution for the previous rules with retrospective effect:
The allotment to him was shifted only because the lands in Ratauli and other villages had been reserved for the Railway workshop. These are matters which could properly be taken into consideration in applying the departmental instructions contained in the Land Re-settlement Manual. There is nothing in the departmental rules which militates against the allotment of lands in Ratauli to the heirs of Rai Sahib Maya Bhan Batra or which takes away the power of cancellation given to the Custodian to cancel the allotment of the appellants.	Section
Such being the principles governing the power of the court to grant a writ of certiorari on the ground of error apparent on the face of the record, we now proceed to consider whether the contention that in the present case there are errors apparent on the face of the record is well founded or not.
It is pointed out that the allotment of land in Ratauli in favour of the appellants were made by the Director General and were never sanctioned by the Financial Commissioner. Further the Rehabilitation authorities charged with the duty of making allotments have exercised their discretion and for cogent reasons state in the Deputy Custodian General's order the allotment to respondents Nos. 3 and 4 were not disturbed.
There is no reason to interfere with that decision on an application under Article 226. None of the pre-requisites for the issue of a writ of certiorari exists and the claim of the appellants as against the respondents Nos. 3 and 4 was therefore, rightly rejected. It was not a proper matter to be decided on a petition under Article 226.
12. For reasons stated above this appear must be dismissed with costs.	Conclusion
1. The appellants have filed this appeal on a certificate of fitness granted on 25th May 1956, by the High Court of Punjab under Article 133 of the Constitution. The appeal is directed against the judgment and order of the said High Court pronounced on 18th October 1955. By that order the said High Court dismissed the application made by the appellants to the said High Court under Article 226 praying for a writ in the nature of a writ of certiorari to call for the records and to quash the order of the Deputy Custodian General passed on 18th August 1953, whereby he cancelled the allotment of lands in the village of Ratauli, Tehsil Jagadhari, District Ambala, made to the appellants on 7th June 1950.
2. The events which led up to the present. appeal may now be briefly stated. The appellants are refugees from Rawalpindi. On the partition of the country the appellants migrated to India abandoning 273 acres 6 kanals of first grade land irrigated by perennial canals situate in Chalk No. 205/R-B., Tehsil Jaranwala, District Lyalpur. In 1947 the appellants were given two units of lands in two villages, Todarpur and Naharpur, in Tehsil Jagadhari, District Ambala on a temporary basis. At the time of quasi-permanent allotment in November 1949, the appellants were given 133 acres 15 1/4 units of land in two villages Khandua and Naharpur, which lands were of the second grade.
On 20th February 1950 the appellants allotment in Khandua was cancelled and the whole of 133 acres 15 1/4 units of land was allotted to them in village Naharpur. In order to accommodate a group of people known as Brij Lal group in village Naharpur the allotment made to the appellants was cancelled on 6th June 1950, and the appellants were directed by the Director General, Relief and Rehabilitation (Additional Custodian), hereinafter referred to as the Director General, to be shifted from village Naharpur to the villages of Jaurian and Kottarkhans in Tehsil Jagadhari in the District of Ambala, where the lands were of the first grade.
It appears that on 7th June 1950, the appellants went post-haste to the head quartets of the Relief and Rehabilitation department protesting against their eviction from Naharpur in view of the improvements alleged to have been made, by them in that village and prayed that they should be retained there. In this application the appellants did not pray for an allotment of land in village Ratauli. The Director General directed the Revenue Assistant to make a report on that application.
On the same date the Revenue Assistant promptly reported that the appellants were sitting allottees of village Naharpur, which was a village of second grade, that the appellants were entitled to first grade lands and that consequently they had been ordered to be shifted from the second grade village to the first grade villages of Jaurian and Kotarkhana in Tehsil Jagadhari. With these remarks he concluded the report with the word "submitted."
In the margin of this report, however, the following words were endorsed: "Area also is reserved for Railway Workshop in village Ratauli. If approved Prem Singh and Narain Singh may be allotted land in the village." It is not easily understandable how, if the land in village Ratauli was reserved for Railway Workshop, such reserved land could be recommended for allotment to the appellants. There is an endorsement by the Director General of the owed "Approved" on the same date.
The extreme expedition with which the order of 6th June 1950 was cancelled and a fresh allotment was made in favour of the appellants in village Ratauli, which they did not ask for, evidently created some doubts in the mind of the Deputy Custodian General as to the regularity of the procedure when he made his order on 18th August 1953. Be that as it may, he did not decide the matter on the strength of such doubts.
After the Director General had "approved" the report sand was issued on 13th July 1950, in favour of the appellants in respect of 133 acres 15 1/4 units of land in village Ratauli and the appellants claim to have been put in possession of this land on 15th July 1950.
3. The respondent NO. 2 (N.R. Basra) is the grand son of one Rai Sahib Maya Bhan Batra (since deceased) who had migrated from Phularwan, Tehsil Bhahval in the District of Shahapur leaving behind about 543 acres of first class land irrigated by canal in the District of Sargodha. On 15th December 1947 36 acres of land were allotted to Rai Sahib Maya Bhan Batra in village Ratauli on a temporary basis. This temporary allotment of 36 acres was, however, reduced to an allotment of 12 acres, for at that time no single allotment was being made for more than 12 acres.
The Rehabilitation Department having, later on issued instructions that persons, who had left large holdings in Pakistan, could be allotted more than 12 acres, Rai Sahib Maya Bhan Batra on 5th June 1918, applied to the Director General for the allotment in he same village of Ratauli of the balance of the lands to which he was entitled. Rai Sahib Maya Bhan Batra died on 29th June 1948, leaving certain heirs of whom the respondent No. 2, N.R. Batra, is one.
Before any allotment could be made in favour of the heirs of Rai Sahib Maya Bhan Batra, a notification, was issued on 9th September 1949 at the instance of the Northern Railway reserving the lands in certain villages including the village of Ratauli for the purpose of construction of a Railway Workshop. In view of the fact that there was no land available in the village of Ratauli, in consequence of the reservation of the lands for the Railways, an area of 112.7 acres was on 11th November 1949, allotted in the name of Rai Sahib Maya Bhan Batra in the village of Mussambal Mussalmanan. In February, 1950 there was a ramous that the Rehabilitation Department had decided that no single allottee would be allowed to have more than 60 acres of land.
In view of this rumour the heirs of Rai Sahib Maya Bhan Batra became apprehensive that the allotment of 112.7 acres in the single name of Rai Sahib might be reduced and so B.L. Batra, a son of the Rai Sahib, made a representation on behalf of all the heirs of the Rai Sahib to the Director General that as they were three brothers and the share of each in 112.7 acres was only about 37 acres, their allotment of 112.7 acres should not be cancelled and that if the allotment for any reason was cancelled they should be accommodated in village Ratauli.
In February or March, 1950, the heirs of Rai Sahib Maya Bhan Batra were allotted lands in three villages, Mussambal Mussalmanan (64 acres 14 3/4 units), Kotarkhana (44 acres 10 3/4 units) and Chahju Nagla (2 acres 13 1/2 units).
4. Respondents Nos. 3 and 4 -- Hargobind and Jai Kishan are the sons of L. Devan Chand Suri, who arc also refugees from Rawalpindi. They were entitled to an allotment of 175 acres in lieu of the lands they had left behind in Pakistan. They applied for allotment in the District of Karnal as unsatisfied claimants. After allotting 133 acres 15 1/4 units of land in village Ratauli there remained a balance of 93 acres still available in that village for allotment.
On August 31, 1950, the Director General allotted those 93 acres of land to Respondents NOS. 3 and 4 and the balance of 82 acres were allotted to him in two other villages Mahalanwali and Habibpur.
5. It appears that after the Railways had abandoned the project of building a workshop on the lands reserved for them, the Officer on Special Duty (AMBALA) wrote to the Director General Relief and Rehabilitation asking him to reserve the lands released by the Railways for accommodating those who had been ousted from Chandigarh, the new capital of the Punjab.
On October 28, 1950, the Director General replied stating that the allotment that had been made in favour of the appellants should stand and that he had no objection if the allotment made in favour of other persons were cancelled. Accordingly the allotment of 93 acres to respondents 3 and 4 in village Ratauli was cancelled. The above cancellation, however, was rescinded and the land was restored to them.
6. It appears from a letter dated April 28, 1950, from the Chief Administrative Officer (Engineering) E. P. Railway, Delhi to the Chief Engineer (Development) Punjab P. W. D. Buildings and Roads Branch. Simla that owing to the stringency of funds the project for construction of the Railway Workshop had been abandoned and that the notification for acquisition of the lands might not be published in the Punjab Government Gazette.
It is not clear at all that this information was passed on to the Relief and Rehabilitation Department at any time prior to September 1950. It appears that the application made by B.L. Batra on February 20, 1950 for allotment of land to them in village Ratauli where they originally had temporary allotments, was followed up by another application by the heirs of Rai Sahib Maya Bhan Batra on March 23, 1951.
The fact of this application is admitted by the Additional Custodian in his written Statement but he stated that it was not forthcoming, presumably meaning that it had been mislaid in the office. A remainder appears to have been sent on August 1, 1951. Not having received any response from the office of the Director General, the respondent No. 2, N.R. Batra, one of the heirs of Rai Sahib Maya Bhan Batra, on December 10, 1951, made a like representation to the Financial Commissioner Relief and Rehabilitation hereinafter referred to as the Financial Commissioner, who was the Custodian.
On July 17, 1952, the Financial Commissioner as custodian rejected the application of Respondent No. 2. The Respondent No. 2 thereupon went in revision under Section 27 of the Administration of Evacuee Property Act (Act XXXI of 1950) Hereinafter referred to as the Act. This application was dealt with and disposed of by the Deputy Custodian General, who held that under the circumstances, the allotment in favour of the appellants in village Ratauli could not be allowed to stand.
He also rejected the contention of the appellants that if anybody were to be evicted iron village Ratauli in order to accommodate the heirs of Rai Sahib Maya Bhan Batra, it should be Respondents Nos. 3 and 4 Hargobind and Jai Kishan, who had obtained their allotment in that village during the pendency of the dispute. The Deputy. Custodian General made the following order on August 18, 1953:
7. The appellants thereupon moved the Punjab High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution praying for a writ quashing the above order of the Deputy Custodian General. The application came up before a Single Judge, who by his order dated September 3, 1954, referred the matter to a Division Bench and the Division Bench in its turn on September 28, 1954, referred the following two questions to a Full Bench for a decision:
The Full Bench answered the first question in the negative and in answer to the second question held that "orders passed by either the Custodian or Custodian General in exercise of their powers under Section 26 or 27 cancelling allotments in pending cases regarding orders passed before 22nd July, 1952, were valid, even if passed by the Custodian before 13th February, 1952, and by the, Custodian General before 25th August, 1953.'' The matter then went back to the Division Bench which, in the light of the answers given by the Full Bench, found no ground torn interference and dismissed the appellant's writ petition. The High Court, however, gave a certificate of fitness for appeal to this Court with which the present appeal has been filed.
8. Mr. Harnam Singh appearing in support of this appeal has not questioned the correctness of the answers given to either, of the questions by the Full Bench. He concedes that the Deputy Custodian General, while disposing of the revision petition on August 18, 1953, could exercise the same powers which the Financial Commissioner as the Custodian had on July 17, 1952, when he rejected the application of Respondent No 2. It wi11 be recalled that the order of allotment in favour of the appellants in village Ratauli was made on June 7, 1950.
The application by Respondent No. 2 to the Financial Commissioner for allotment of lands in village Ratauli was made on December 10, 1951. This application was rejected by the Financial Commissioner on July 17, 1952. At that time there was no Sub-rule (6) to Rule 14. Indeed Sub-rule (6) was added to Rule 14 on July 22, 1952. The second provision was added to Rule 14 on February 13, 1953, that is to say, after the Respondent NO. 2 had filed his application for revision under Section 27 to the Custodian General on September 9, 1952.
The second provision was again amended by the addition of the words "or Section 27" after the figure 28 and before the words "of the Act' on August 25, 1953, that is to say, seven days after the Deputy Custodian General made his order in revision under Section 27 Rule 14 (6) being thus acknowledged by learned counsel to be out of the way, it is not necessary at all for us to express any opinion on the correctness or otherwise of the answers given by the full Bench to the question referred to it.
Accepting, without deciding that the Deputy Custodian General's powers in revision under Section 27 of the Act were strictly limited to the powers of the Custodian to cancel an allotment, what we have to do is to ascertain what powers of cancellation the Financial Commissioner, who was she Custodian, had on July 17, 1952, when he rejected the application, for according to learned counsel for the appellants the Deputy Custodian General could only exercise similar powers of cancellation while disposing of the application for revision of the order of the Financial Commissioner as the Custodian.
9. The Administration of Evacuee Property Act, 1950 (Act XXXI of 1950), was passed on April 17, 1950. The Central Government on September 8, 1950 framed rules in exercise of the powers conferred on it by Section 56 of the Act. On that date Rule 14 Consisted of five clauses namely, the present Sub-rule 1 to Sub-rule (5) which, however, is not material for our present purpose.
In exercise of powers delegated by the Central Government under Sub-section 1 of Section 55 of the Act to make rules under Clause 1 of Sub-section (2) of Section 56 of the said Act, the Punjab Government on August 29, 1951 promulgated, amongst other things the following rule, in substitution for the previous rules with retrospective effect:
10. Learned counsel for the appellants next contends that the order of the Deputy Custodian General is obviously wrong and is liable to be quashed by a writ in the nature of certiorari, because of such glaring errors apparent on the face of the record. In Hari Vishnu, v. Ahmad Ishaque, , a Full Bench of this Court, after referring to the various decisions of the English and Indian Courts, summarised the principles deducible there from in the following words:
Then after referring to the case of Rex v. Northumberland Compensation Appeal Tribunal; Ex parte Shaw, 1951-1 K B 711 (B) and Ors. cases and quoting the following passage from the judgment of Mukherjea J. in T. C. Basappa v. T. Nagappa, .
This Court held on the fourth point as follows:
Such being the principles governing the power of the court to grant a writ of certiorari on the ground of error apparent on the face of the record, we now proceed to consider whether the contention that in the present case there are errors apparent on the face of the record is well founded or not.
11. Learned counsel has enumerated the following errors, namely: -
The allotment to him was shifted only because the lands in Ratauli and other villages had been reserved for the Railway workshop. These are matters which could properly be taken into consideration in applying the departmental instructions contained in the Land Re-settlement Manual. There is nothing in the departmental rules which militates against the allotment of lands in Ratauli to the heirs of Rai Sahib Maya Bhan Batra or which takes away the power of cancellation given to the Custodian to cancel the allotment of the appellants.
These departmental instructions, on the appellants own showing in sub-para (viii) of para. 12 of their petition under Article 226, were not inflexible and were not adhered to rigidly and were merely in the nature of procedure and that the rehabilitation authorities had full authority and complete powers to mate allotment without adhering rigidly to the departmental instructions, e.g., the scheme of sub-allocation. It, therefore, does not lie in the mouth of the appellants to say, that these departmental instructions are law and that in the context of these departmental instructions it must be held that there is an error of law apparent on the face of the judgment.
The errors pointed out, if they are errors at all, are mostly errors of fact and even if the errors may by any stretch of argument be said to constitute errors of law, they are nothing more than mere errors of law, which may be corrected by a court of appeal but which do not reader, the order a "speaking order" showing a clear ignorance or disregard of the provisions of the law, so as to be amenable to correction by a writ of 'certiorari. There is, in our opinion, no substance in this contention.
(11a) The last point urged by learned counsel for the appellant is that if anybody is to be ousted from village Ratauli for accommodating the respondent No. 2, there is no reason why the appellants should be ousted and not the respondents Nos. 3 and 4. Learned counsel for the respondents Nos. 3 and 4 urged with considerable force that there are good grounds for not disturbing his clients.
In the first place, the appellants are bigger allottees and if anybody were to be disturbed, it must be the bigger allottees and not the smaller. Reference is made to page 84 of the Land Resettlement Manual and it is claimed that this rule has laid down a rule of equity of general application. In the next place the appellants and the respondents Nos. 3 and 4 both come from Rawalpindi and they can be re-settled in Ratauli only on sanction given by Financial Commissioner and reference is made to page 82, paragraph 7 of Chapter (iv) which lays down the principles of allocation.
It is pointed out that the allotment of land in Ratauli in favour of the appellants were made by the Director General and were never sanctioned by the Financial Commissioner. Further the Rehabilitation authorities charged with the duty of making allotments have exercised their discretion and for cogent reasons state in the Deputy Custodian General's order the allotment to respondents Nos. 3 and 4 were not disturbed.
There is no reason to interfere with that decision on an application under Article 226. None of the pre-requisites for the issue of a writ of certiorari exists and the claim of the appellants as against the respondents Nos. 3 and 4 was therefore, rightly rejected. It was not a proper matter to be decided on a petition under Article 226.
12. For reasons stated above this appear must be dismissed with costs.	Total Judgement
