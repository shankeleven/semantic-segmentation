On March 11, 1952, the Government of Assam, in exercise of the powers conferred by s. 3 read with sub-s. (2) of s. 5 of the Act issued the following notification:
(p.d.) (p.d.) (p.d.)(p.d.)(p.d.)(p.d.)
By notification No. GLR. 44/51, dated the 16th April, 1952, the said Government introduced the Minimum Wages Rules which, inter alia, provided:
Section 20 so far as is material for our purposes provides:
It -is argued that the authority appointed under s. 20(1) of the Act is invested with the powers of hearing and deciding claims arising out of the payment of less than the minimum rates of wages and is authorised to hear the applicant and the employer or give them an opportunity of being heard, and, after such further enquiry, as it may consider necessary, to give directions under s. 20(3) of the Act which directions are final and not subject to any appeal or revision by any higher authority. Such drastic powers could not have been meant to be exercised when there are complicated questions of law or fact but could be exercised only in cases where the, quantum of minimum wages fixed by the notification in question could be determined by the authority on a plain reading of the terms, thereof. Then and -then only would the authority have jurisdiction to entertain such claims and give the necessary direction,% having the attribute of finality. In the instant cases before us, not only did the matters involve complicated questions of fact which required recording of evidence by the authority but they also involved the construction of the notification which was by no means felicitously worded. The existing tasks which were to continue until further orders were not at all patent and if the determination thereof had to be made by the authority appointed under s. 20(1) of the Act, it would involve, in cases of dispute, recording of considerable evidence and an adjudication of the same after a consideration of the arguments advanced before the authority by both the parties.
There is in the instant cases moreover a further difficulty and it is that there are two rival contentions which can, with equal force, be urged by the respective parties. The appellants contend that they have all throughout been paying to the laborers, after the date of the notification in question, basic wages at the rate of as. 12/- per day for male labourers and as. 1 1 /- per day for the female labourers and there is no instance which has been cited on behalf of the respondents where, anything less then the minimum basic wages thus fixed by the Government has ever been paid. The claim of the labourers comes to this that they have not been paid the extra wages for plucking green leaves in excess of the basic work-load or task of 16 seers and 12 seers respectively. Such claim for extra wages certainly does not amount to a claim arising out of the payment of less than the minimum rates of wages. It is, on the other hand, contended on behalf of the respondents that the basic wages of as. 12/. per day for male labourers and as. II/- per day for female labourers fixed under the notification are correlated -to the existing work-load, or task of plucking green leaves weighing 16 Beers and 12 seers respectively and if they are entitled to the payment of these basic wages on their putting forward that much quantity of work, the non- payment by the managers.of these tea' estates to them of any extra wages on the computation of 6 ps. per extra seer un- less they plucked 24 seers and 22 seers of green leaves respectively is tantamount to nonpayment of the; minimum basic wages of as. 12/- and as. 11/- respectively as fixed in the notification.

Naunit Lal, for respondent No. I in both Appeals. 1956. December 21. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI J.-,These two appeals with certificates under Art. 133 (1) (c) of the Constitution are directed against a judgment of the High Court of Judicature in Assam dismissing the appellants' application under Art. 226 challenging the orders -of the first respondent Shri B.

By notification No. GLR. 44/51, dated the 16th April, 1952, the said Government introduced the Minimum Wages Rules which, inter alia, provided:
..................................................." By another notification No. GLR. 352/51 dated May 12, 1952, the said Government explained that the word " may "
load or task of 16 seers of tea leaves to be plucked by the male labourers and 12 seers of tea leaves to be plucked by the female labourers.
It is argued that the continuance of the existing work-load or task which was thus provided for had no relation to the basic wages which were fixed for the male and female labourers respectively but was only intended to prevent the employers from increasing the existing work-load or task with a view to make up for the increase in basic wages. This argument, however, does not take count of the fact that there was existing at the date of the notification a work- load or task which was the basis of the payments used to be made to the labourers, the basic wages paid to them being calculated at the rate of 6 ps. per seer of tea leaves plucked by them. The labourers were thus being paid the basic wages of as. 8/- for male labourers and as. 6/for female labourers for the work-load or task of plucking 16 seers and 12 seers of tea leaves respectively and the sole intention of the Government in issuing the notification was to increase these basic wages of as. 8/and as. 6/- to as. 12/- and as. II/- respectively while maintaining the same basic work-load or task assigned to the male and female labourers. If the intention was not to correlate these basic wages to the basic work-load or task which already existed and if the same state of affairs was to continue, viz., that the labourers would continue to be paid the basic wages on the computation of 6 ps. per seer of green leaves plucked by them, there was no sense whatever in increasing the basic wages from as. 8/- to as. 12/- for male labourers and from as. 6/- to as. II/- for female labourers as was sought to be done by issuing the notification in question. The acceptance of the contention of the appellants would mean that no advantage whatever was sought to be conferred by the Government on the labourers engaged in plucking leaves in these tea estates which intention can scarcely be attributed to the Government. We are, therefore, of opinion that what was fixed by the notification was not merely " a minimum time rate" irrespective of the existing work-load or task which used to be performed by the labourers- but was a' minimum wage which, though fixed for time work, was necessarily correlated to the work-load or task then being performed by these labourers so that whatever extra work was done by the labourers in excess of the existing work-load or task of plucking 16 seers of tea leaves in the case of male labourers and 12 seers of tea leaves in the case of female labourers had to be paid for in accordance with the practice then prevailing, whether it was based on agreement or ticca or custom, at the rate of 6 ps. per seer. The conclusions reached in this behalf both by the Deputy Commissioner, Sibsagar, and the High Court are, therefore, correct and cannot be challenged.
The appellants, however, contend that this is not a case of payment of less than the minimum rates of wages and the claims, if any, of the labourers do not fall within s. 20 of the Act. The tea estates in question have never refused to pay and are in fact paying to the labourers the basic wages of as. 12/- per day for male labourers and as. II /- per day for female labourers and the grievance, if any, of the labourers is that they have not been paid the extra wages calculated on the basis of 6 ps. per seer for tea leaves plucked by them in excess of the basic work-load or task of 16 seers for male labourers and 12 seers for female labourers. This claim of the labourers, therefore, amounts to a claim for extra wages over and above the basic wages of as. 12/- and as. II/- per day respectively which are being paid to them and, therefore, is not a claim arising out of the payment of less than the minimum rates of wages within the meaning of s. 20(1) of the Act and the Deputy Commissioner, Sibsagar, had no jurisdiction to entertain such claim.
Section 20 so far as is material for our purposes provides:
It -is argued that the authority appointed under s. 20(1) of the Act is invested with the powers of hearing and deciding claims arising out of the payment of less than the minimum rates of wages and is authorised to hear the applicant and the employer or give them an opportunity of being heard, and, after such further enquiry, as it may consider necessary, to give directions under s. 20(3) of the Act which directions are final and not subject to any appeal or revision by any higher authority. Such drastic powers could not have been meant to be exercised when there are complicated questions of law or fact but could be exercised only in cases where the, quantum of minimum wages fixed by the notification in question could be determined by the authority on a plain reading of the terms, thereof. Then and -then only would the authority have jurisdiction to entertain such claims and give the necessary direction,% having the attribute of finality. In the instant cases before us, not only did the matters involve complicated questions of fact which required recording of evidence by the authority but they also involved the construction of the notification which was by no means felicitously worded.

The claim of the labourers comes to this that they have not been paid the extra wages for plucking green leaves in excess of the basic work-load or task of 16 seers and 12 seers respectively. Such claim for extra wages certainly does not amount to a claim arising out of the payment of less than the minimum rates of wages. It is, on the other hand, contended on behalf of the respondents that the basic wages of as. 12/. per day for male labourers and as. II/- per day for female labourers fixed under the notification are correlated -to the existing work-load, or task of plucking green leaves weighing 16 Beers and 12 seers respectively and if they are entitled to the payment of these basic wages on their putting forward that much quantity of work, the non- payment by the managers.of these tea' estates to them of any extra wages on the computation of 6 ps. per extra seer un- less they plucked 24 seers and 22 seers of green leaves respectively is tantamount to nonpayment of the; minimum basic wages of as. 12/- and as. 11/- respectively as fixed in the notification.
