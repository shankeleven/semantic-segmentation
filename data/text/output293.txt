The Union Of India vs Madan Gopal Kabra on 16 December, 1953	Case Title
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Case No. 296 of 1951. Appeal against the Judgment and Order dated the 16th January, 1951, of the High Court of Judicature for the State of Rajasthan at Jodhpur (Nawal Kishore and Kanwar Lal Bapna JJ.) in D. B. Civil Miscellaneous Case No. 15 of 1950. M. C. Setalvad, Attorney-General for India (G. N. Joshi, with him) for the appellant.
The respondent resides and carries on business in the District of Jodhpur in Rajasthan which is one of the States specified in Part B of the First Schedule to the Constitution (hereinafter referred to as Part B States). In May, 1950, the respondent was required to file a return of his income for the previous year, that is the year ending March 31, 1950, for assessment to income-tax, and subsequently was also asked to produce the relevant account books before the Income-tax Officer, Jodhpur, on August 11, 1950. Thereupon the respondent presented the petition, out of which this appeal arises, on August 23, 1950, invoking the, jurisdiction of the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution for the issue of "a writ of mandamus or certiorari or other appropriate writ"directing the appellant not to take a any action under the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, (hereinafter referred to as the Indian Act) as amended by the Indian Finance Act, 1950, for the assessment or levy of income-tax on the income which accrued or arose to the respondent or was received by him prior to April 1, 1950, on the ground that such income was not liable to be charged "under the provisions of any law validly in force in Rajasthan."	Issue
The petition was heard by a Division Bench of the High Court (Nawal Kishore and Kanwarlal Bapna JJ.) who accepted the petition and issued a writ as already stated, overruling sundry preliminary objections to which no reference need be made as they have not been raised by the appellant before us.
Now, the scheme of the Indian Act is to tax a person resident in the taxable territories during the previous year on all his income of the previous year whether accruing within or without the taxable territories, and to tax a person not resident in the taxable territories upon his income accruing within the taxable territories during the previous year. Residence in the taxable territories has to be determined in accordance with the provisions of section 4-A which, in the case of an individual, takes into account his having been in such territories within the -five years preceding the year of assessment. If Rajasthan was a taxable territory in the year 1949-50, the respondent would be chargeable in respect of his income whether derived within or without .Rajasthan. It is, however, argued on his behalf by Mr. Chatterjee that section 3 of the Finance Act, 1950, having substituted the amended clause .(14-A) " with effect from the first day of April, 1950," Rajasthan was not a taxable territory during the accounting year 1949-50, and that no income-tax being admittedly leviable in that State on the income accruing there in that year, the new clause (14-A) should not be construed so as to impose liability to pay Indian incometax on such income.

1953. December 16. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by PATANJALI SASTRI C. J.-This is an appeal from an order of the High Court of Rajasthan directing by writ issued under article 226 of the Constitution that the Union of India, appellant herein, should not levy income-tax on the income of the respondent accruing, arising or received in Rajasthan (excluding the area of the former covenanting State of Bundi) prior to April 1, 1950.
As is well-known, after the Indian Independence Act, 1947, came into force, various Indian States (as they were then known) which had been recognised, subject to certain restrictions and limitations not material here, as independent principalities were brought into the Dominion of India from, time to time under arrangements with their Rulers, and this process of accession and integration . resulted in the expansion of the territory of India in successive stages. So far as Rajasthan is concerned, the Rajaputana States, as they were then called, integrated their territories into the United State of Rajasthan, and the new State acceded to the Dominion of India by an Instrument of Accession executed by the head of the State (Rajpramukh) on April 15, 1949, and accepted by the Governor-General of India on May 12, 1949. By clause (3) of the Instrument the Rajpramukh accepted "all matters enumerated in Lists I and III of the Seventh Schedule to the Act (the Government of India Act, 1935) as matters in respect of which the ]Dominion Legislature may make laws for the United State, provided that nothing contained in the said Lists or in -any other provisions of the Act shall be deemed to empower the Dominion Legislature to impose -any tax or duty in the territories of the United State or prohibit the imposition of any duty or tax by the Legislature of the United State in the said territories.":
(b) of the proviso must be taken to mean only computation of income and not the imposition of liability. In support of the construction he relied on the decision of the Privy Council in Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay v. Khemchand Ramdas(1) where it was said that the word "assessment" was used in the Indian Income-tax Act as meaning "sometimes the computation of income, sometimes the determination of tax payable and sometimes the whole procedure laid down in the Act for imposing liability on the taxpayer." Mr. Chatterjee reinforced the argument by referring to the repealing and saving provisions of section 13 which he read as keeping alive a State law of incometax in.force in any Part B State "for the purposes of levy, assessment and collection of tax"
-territory of Rajasthan.
As already observed, the learned Judges below, in order to reinforce their construction of sub-clause (iii) of clause
It was said, however, that the line of decisions like, Queen v. Burah(1), which defined the powers of legislatures created by the British Parliament, could have no application to the Union Parliament which came into life as a new legislature on the commencement of the Indian Constitution. It could not be assumed that such a legislature had the power of making -a law having retrospective operation in relation to a perio prior to its birth unless the Constitution itself clearly and explicitly conferred such power. In support of this argument certain observations of one of the Judges in an Australian case [Exparte Walsh and Johnson ; In re Yates(2)] were relied on. We are unable to accept the argument. Our Constitution, as appears from the Preamble, derives its authority from the people of India, and learned counsel conceded that it was open to the people to confer on the legislatures established by the Constitution, which they framed through their representatives, power to make laws having operation in relation to periods prior to the commencement of the Constitution. But, it was insisted, such a power should be given in clearly expressed terms. There is, however, no question here of the Constitution operating retrospectively in bringing into existence the Union Parliament or the legislatures of the States. The only question is 'What powers have been conferred upon these legislatures by the representatives of the people who framed the Constitution and, in determining that issue, the principles laid down in cases. like Queen v.Burah (1) apply in full foree. The observations in the Australian -case, to which reference has been made, seem to us (1) 5 I.A. 178.
(2) 37 C.L. R. 36, at pp 80, 81, to go too far and cannot be accepted as sound constitutional doctrine.	Precedent
the income of the year 1949-50 into charge under the Indian Act.
This argument found favour with the learned Judges in the High Court but we are unable to accept it. A short answer to it is provided by sub-clause (i) of clause (b) of the proviso under which the whole of the territory of India including Rajasthan is to be deemed taxable territory for the purpose of section 4-A of the Indian Act "as respects any period." The words "any period" cannot be taken to mean "any period after March 31, 1950," for the period referred to in the next clause is expressly limited in that sense.' Those limiting words cannot be read into sub-clause (i) which must, therefore, be understood as referring to any period before or after March 31, 1950. As already indicated, residence in the taxable territories within the meaning of section 4-A can, in some cases, relate back to as many as five years before the year of assessment, and that is obviously the reason why the period mentioned in sub- claure (i) is not limited as in sub-clause (iii) of clause
(b) of the proviso. Indeed, if the words "any period" id sub-clause (i) were intended to mean any period after March 31, 1950, that sub-clause of the proviso which enacts a fiction, would be wholly unnecessary, for clauses (d) and
Even assuming it were necessary for the Revenue to bring the case within proviso (b) (iii) in order to sustain the charge on the respondent's income accruing in Rajasthan during the year 1949-50, we are of opinion that the construction, placed by the learned Judges on that clause cannot be supported. They assume that proviso (b) (iii) is a provision authorising assessment of income-tax, and proceed to discuss what the word "'assessment" in that context should be taken to mean. Charge of income to tax and its computation are matters governed by other provisions of the Indian Act. All that section 2 (14-A) does is to define what the expression "taxable territories" means in certain cases and for certain purposes wherever that expression is used in the various provisions of the Indian Act.
And as the expression is used in the charging section 4 in connection with the conditions which are to determine liability to tax, sub-clause (iii) of clause (b) of the definition must, when read with section 4 of the Indian Act, have reference to chargeability of income. The result is that sections 3 and 4 of the Indian Act read in the light of the definition in proviso (b) to the amended section 2 (14- A) and section 2 of the Indian Finance Act, 1950, authorise the imposition of the Indian income-tax and super-tax on the income derived 'by the respondent in they are 1949-50 in the
(b) of the proviso, read section 13 of the Finance Act as keeping alive the law of income-tax in force in any Part B State for purposes of levy, assessment, and collection of tax in respect of the income -of 1949-50. This, in our opinion, is not the effect of section 13 on its true construction. After referring to the decision of the Privy Council to which reference has been made, the learned Judges say--
Nor can it be said, in strictness, that the Finance Act, 1950, is retroactive legislation. That Act, as already noticed, purports by section 2 to charge income-tax and super-tax at specified rates "for the year beginning on the last day of April, 1950". The case,is thus one where the statute purports to operate only prospectively, but such operation has, under the scheme of the Indian income-tax law, to take into account income earned before the statute came into force. Such an enactment cannot, strictly speaking, be said to be retroactive legislation, though its operation may affect acts done in the past. Dealing with a statute authorising the removal of destitute widows from a parish, it was observed in an English case [Queen v. St. Mary, Whitechapel(1) 1: "It was said that the operation of the statute is confined to persons who have become widows after the Act was passed and that the presumption against a retrospective statute being intended supported this construction. But we have before shown that the statute is in its direct operation prospective as it relates to future removals only and that it is not properly called a retrospective statute because a part of the requisites for its action is drawn from time antecedent to its passing." It is, however, unnessary to pursue this aspect of the matter further as we have held that Parliament has the power to make retroactive laws.
Secondly, it was said that section 101 of the Government of India Act, 1935, which gave effect to the stipulation in the Instrument of Accession against the imposition by the Dominion Legislature. of any tax or duty in the territory of the United State of Rajasthan, was kept alive, notwithstanding its repeal by article 395 of the Constitution, by section 6 of the General Clauses Act,, 1897, [which is made applicable to the interpretation of the Constitution by article 367 (1)] as a " right" or "privilege" acquired under the repealed enactment, and so (1) (1848) i2 Q.B. 120,127; ii6 E.R. 8ii, 814.
continued to operate under article 372 (1) as a con- stitutional limitation on the power of Parliament, with the result that Parliament had no power to impose tax contrary to section 101 of the Government of India Act, 1935. The argument is somewhat ingenious but there are obvious difficulties in the way of its acceptance. For one thing, section 101 of the Government of India Act, 1935, created no right or privilege in the subjects of the United State of Rajasthan which, notwithstanding the repeal of that section, could be regarded as still enuring for their benefit. Section 101 merely imposed a restriction upon the power of the Dominion Legislature to make laws for an acceding State inconsistent with the stipulations contained in the Instrument of Accession. When that section along with the rest of the Government of India Act, 1935, was repealed by the new Constitution, which has created new legislatures with power to make retroactive laws, it is idle to suggest that rights or privileges acquired while the old Constitution Act was in force are preserved for ever-for that must be the result of the argument-by section 6 of the General Clauses Act, which can have no application to such cases. Furthermore, it will be recalled that the Proclamation made by the Rajpramukh as Ruler of Rajasthan on 23rd November, 1949, declared and directed that the Constitution of India when brought into force "shall be- the Constitution for the Rajasthan State" and it expressly "superseded and abrogated all other constitutional provisions inconsistent therewith" which were then in force. The competency of the Rajpramukh as the Ruler of the State to accept the Constitution of India as governing that State also was not challenged before us, and it is manifest that, after such declaration and direction, no I restriction imposed on the Dominion Legislature by the Instrument of Accession and enforced by section 101 of the Government of India Act could prevail against the legislative powers conferred on Parliament by the Constitution of India. The difference in the constitutional position which previously existed between the Provinces and the acceding: States has thus disappeared except, of course, in regard to matters in
-which such distinction has been preserved by the Constitution itself, e.g., by article 238 and article 371. It follows that the amendment of section' 2 clause (14-A) of the Indian Act, by the Finance Act, 1950, so as to authorise the levy of tax on income accruing in the territory of Rajasthan in the year 1949-50 is within the competence of Parliament and therefore valid.

CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Case No. 296 of 1951. Appeal against the Judgment and Order dated the 16th January, 1951, of the High Court of Judicature for the State of Rajasthan at Jodhpur (Nawal Kishore and Kanwar Lal Bapna JJ.) in D. B. Civil Miscellaneous Case No. 15 of 1950. M. C. Setalvad, Attorney-General for India (G. N. Joshi, with him) for the appellant.

1953. December 16. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by PATANJALI SASTRI C. J.-This is an appeal from an order of the High Court of Rajasthan directing by writ issued under article 226 of the Constitution that the Union of India, appellant herein, should not levy income-tax on the income of the respondent accruing, arising or received in Rajasthan (excluding the area of the former covenanting State of Bundi) prior to April 1, 1950.
The respondent resides and carries on business in the District of Jodhpur in Rajasthan which is one of the States specified in Part B of the First Schedule to the Constitution (hereinafter referred to as Part B States). In May, 1950, the respondent was required to file a return of his income for the previous year, that is the year ending March 31, 1950, for assessment to income-tax, and subsequently was also asked to produce the relevant account books before the Income-tax Officer, Jodhpur, on August 11, 1950. Thereupon the respondent presented the petition, out of which this appeal arises, on August 23, 1950, invoking the, jurisdiction of the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution for the issue of "a writ of mandamus or certiorari or other appropriate writ"directing the appellant not to take a any action under the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922, (hereinafter referred to as the Indian Act) as amended by the Indian Finance Act, 1950, for the assessment or levy of income-tax on the income which accrued or arose to the respondent or was received by him prior to April 1, 1950, on the ground that such income was not liable to be charged "under the provisions of any law validly in force in Rajasthan."
The petition was heard by a Division Bench of the High Court (Nawal Kishore and Kanwarlal Bapna JJ.) who accepted the petition and issued a writ as already stated, overruling sundry preliminary objections to which no reference need be made as they have not been raised by the appellant before us.
As is well-known, after the Indian Independence Act, 1947, came into force, various Indian States (as they were then known) which had been recognised, subject to certain restrictions and limitations not material here, as independent principalities were brought into the Dominion of India from, time to time under arrangements with their Rulers, and this process of accession and integration . resulted in the expansion of the territory of India in successive stages. So far as Rajasthan is concerned, the Rajaputana States, as they were then called, integrated their territories into the United State of Rajasthan, and the new State acceded to the Dominion of India by an Instrument of Accession executed by the head of the State (Rajpramukh) on April 15, 1949, and accepted by the Governor-General of India on May 12, 1949. By clause (3) of the Instrument the Rajpramukh accepted "all matters enumerated in Lists I and III of the Seventh Schedule to the Act (the Government of India Act, 1935) as matters in respect of which the ]Dominion Legislature may make laws for the United State, provided that nothing contained in the said Lists or in -any other provisions of the Act shall be deemed to empower the Dominion Legislature to impose -any tax or duty in the territories of the United State or prohibit the imposition of any duty or tax by the Legislature of the United State in the said territories.":
The definition, it may be observed in passing, is by no means a model of perspicuity. Parts of it seem redundant and even mutually contradictory. For instance, (leaving out the State of Jammu and Kashmir altogether in this discussion) whereas clause (d) excludes the Patiala and the East Punjab States Union from the taxable territories as respects the period from April 1, 1950, to April 12, 1950, subclause (ii) of clause (b) of the proviso would seem to include that State also within such territories as respects the same period, and while clauses (d) and (e) of the substantive part of the definition when read together seem apt by themselves to bring the territory of India within the taxable territories as respects the period after March 31, 1950, sub-clause (ii) of clause (b) of the proviso apparently seeks to bring about the same result by means of a fiction.
Now, the scheme of the Indian Act is to tax a person resident in the taxable territories during the previous year on all his income of the previous year whether accruing within or without the taxable territories, and to tax a person not resident in the taxable territories upon his income accruing within the taxable territories during the previous year. Residence in the taxable territories has to be determined in accordance with the provisions of section 4-A which, in the case of an individual, takes into account his having been in such territories within the -five years preceding the year of assessment. If Rajasthan was a taxable territory in the year 1949-50, the respondent would be chargeable in respect of his income whether derived within or without .Rajasthan. It is, however, argued on his behalf by Mr. Chatterjee that section 3 of the Finance Act, 1950, having substituted the amended clause .(14-A) " with effect from the first day of April, 1950," Rajasthan was not a taxable territory during the accounting year 1949-50, and that no income-tax being admittedly leviable in that State on the income accruing there in that year, the new clause (14-A) should not be construed so as to impose liability to pay Indian incometax on such income. According to learned counsel the word "assessment" in sub-clause (iii) of clause
(b) of the proviso must be taken to mean only computation of income and not the imposition of liability. In support of the construction he relied on the decision of the Privy Council in Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay v. Khemchand Ramdas(1) where it was said that the word "assessment" was used in the Indian Income-tax Act as meaning "sometimes the computation of income, sometimes the determination of tax payable and sometimes the whole procedure laid down in the Act for imposing liability on the taxpayer." Mr. Chatterjee reinforced the argument by referring to the repealing and saving provisions of section 13 which he read as keeping alive a State law of incometax in.force in any Part B State "for the purposes of levy, assessment and collection of tax"
the income of the year 1949-50 into charge under the Indian Act.
This argument found favour with the learned Judges in the High Court but we are unable to accept it. A short answer to it is provided by sub-clause (i) of clause (b) of the proviso under which the whole of the territory of India including Rajasthan is to be deemed taxable territory for the purpose of section 4-A of the Indian Act "as respects any period." The words "any period" cannot be taken to mean "any period after March 31, 1950," for the period referred to in the next clause is expressly limited in that sense.' Those limiting words cannot be read into sub-clause (i) which must, therefore, be understood as referring to any period before or after March 31, 1950. As already indicated, residence in the taxable territories within the meaning of section 4-A can, in some cases, relate back to as many as five years before the year of assessment, and that is obviously the reason why the period mentioned in sub- claure (i) is not limited as in sub-clause (iii) of clause
(b) of the proviso. Indeed, if the words "any period" id sub-clause (i) were intended to mean any period after March 31, 1950, that sub-clause of the proviso which enacts a fiction, would be wholly unnecessary, for clauses (d) and
(e) of the substantive part of the definition taken together clearly have the effect, as already stated, of making the territory of India a taxable territory , during that period. If Rajasthan was thus a part of the taxable territories during such period preceding the assessment year, 1950-51, as would be necessary to make the respondent "resident" in such territories within the meaning of section 4-A, then the income accruing or. arising, to him in Rajasthan during the year 1949-50 would be taxable though, Rajasthan was not part of the taxable territories in that year, for, in the case of a person resident in the taxable territories, income accruing or arising to him without the taxable territories is also chargeable to tax under section 4, sub-section (1) clause @b) sub-clause.(ii) of the Indian Act. This aspect of the matter does not appear to have been sufficiently appreciated in the court below. The learned Judges say:
Even assuming it were necessary for the Revenue to bring the case within proviso (b) (iii) in order to sustain the charge on the respondent's income accruing in Rajasthan during the year 1949-50, we are of opinion that the construction, placed by the learned Judges on that clause cannot be supported. They assume that proviso (b) (iii) is a provision authorising assessment of income-tax, and proceed to discuss what the word "'assessment" in that context should be taken to mean.

All that section 2 (14-A) does is to define what the expression "taxable territories" means in certain cases and for certain purposes wherever that expression is used in the various provisions of the Indian Act.
And as the expression is used in the charging section 4 in connection with the conditions which are to determine liability to tax, sub-clause (iii) of clause (b) of the definition must, when read with section 4 of the Indian Act, have reference to chargeability of income. The result is that sections 3 and 4 of the Indian Act read in the light of the definition in proviso (b) to the amended section 2 (14- A) and section 2 of the Indian Finance Act, 1950, authorise the imposition of the Indian income-tax and super-tax on the income derived 'by the respondent in they are 1949-50 in the
-territory of Rajasthan.
As already observed, the learned Judges below, in order to reinforce their construction of sub-clause (iii) of clause
(b) of the proviso, read section 13 of the Finance Act as keeping alive the law of income-tax in force in any Part B State for purposes of levy, assessment, and collection of tax in respect of the income -of 1949-50. This, in our opinion, is not the effect of section 13 on its true construction. After referring to the decision of the Privy Council to which reference has been made, the learned Judges say--
It was said, however, that the line of decisions like, Queen v. Burah(1), which defined the powers of legislatures created by the British Parliament, could have no application to the Union Parliament which came into life as a new legislature on the commencement of the Indian Constitution. It could not be assumed that such a legislature had the power of making -a law having retrospective operation in relation to a perio prior to its birth unless the Constitution itself clearly and explicitly conferred such power. In support of this argument certain observations of one of the Judges in an Australian case [Exparte Walsh and Johnson ; In re Yates(2)] were relied on. We are unable to accept the argument. Our Constitution, as appears from the Preamble, derives its authority from the people of India, and learned counsel conceded that it was open to the people to confer on the legislatures established by the Constitution, which they framed through their representatives, power to make laws having operation in relation to periods prior to the commencement of the Constitution. But, it was insisted, such a power should be given in clearly expressed terms. There is, however, no question here of the Constitution operating retrospectively in bringing into existence the Union Parliament or the legislatures of the States. The only question is 'What powers have been conferred upon these legislatures by the representatives of the people who framed the Constitution and, in determining that issue, the principles laid down in cases. like Queen v.Burah (1) apply in full foree. The observations in the Australian -case, to which reference has been made, seem to us (1) 5 I.A. 178.
(2) 37 C.L. R. 36, at pp 80, 81, to go too far and cannot be accepted as sound constitutional doctrine.
