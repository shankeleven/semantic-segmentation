CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Criminal Appeal No. 33 of 1955.
Appeal under Articles 132 (1) and 134 (1) (c) of the Constitution of India from the Judgment and Order dated June 30, 1954, of the Court of Judicial Commissioner, Kutch in Criminal Revision Application No. 13 of 1952. Porus A. Mehta and B. H. Dhebar, for the appellant. H. J. Umrigar, for the respondent.
1957. March 7. The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR J.-Two important questions arise for decision in this case of a small magnitude and the State has filed this appeal not for the purpose of obtaining a conviction but because of the importance of the questions raised and implications of the judgment of the Judicial Commissioner. The respondent was convicted of an offence under s. 12(a) of the Bombay Prevention of Gambling Act (Act IV of 1887 hereinafter termed the Bombay Act) as applied to Kutch and was sentenced to a fine of Rs. 50 or in default simple imprisonment for 15 days and for- feiture of the amounts recovered from the respondent at the time of the commission of the offence. He took a' revision to the Judicial Commissioner of Kutch, who hold that the Act under which the respondent had been convicted had not been validly extended to and was not. in force in the State of Kutch. It is the correctness of this decision which has been canvassed before us.	Issue
On June 7, 1951, the respondent, it was alleged committed the offence he was charged with He was convicted by the magistrate on July 26, 1951, and his revision to the Sessions Judge was dismissed. He then took a revision to the Judicial Commissioner of Kutch who allowed his petition on June. 30, 1954, and granted a certificate under Arts. 132(1) and 134(1) of the Constitution.
Kutch before 1948 was what was called an Indian State. The Maharao of Kutch handed over the gover. nance of the State to the Dominion of India on June 1, 1948 and thus the whole administration of the State passed to the Dominion and it became a Centrally administered area. On July 31, 1949, the then Central Government issued under s. 4 of the Extra Provincial Jurisdiction Act (Act XLVII of 1947), an order called the Kutch (Application of Laws) Order, 1949. Under cl. 3 of this order certain enactments were applied to Kutch with effect from the date of the commencement of the order. One of these enactments was the -Bombay Act. Clauses 4 and 6 of this order are important and may be quoted;

It was then contended that by the mere application of the Bombay Act to Kutch it became operative and came into force in the whole of Kutch. This argument suffers from the infirmity that in its application to Kutch s. 1 of the Bombay Act would have to be excluded which would be an incorrect way of looking at the question. The true position is that the whole of the -Act including amended s. 1 as given above, became applicable to Kutch and therefore a notification ,was necessary before it could be brought into force in any part of Kutch. It was applied to Kutch, but its provisions were not in operation before the notification; and in our opinion, the judgment of Baxi J. C. in Agaria Osman Alarakhya v. The Kutch State (1) which has been followed in the case now before us, to the extent that it dealt with the necessity of a notification under s. 1 of the Bombay Act, was correctly decided; and therefore, the first contention raised by counsel for the appellant is unsustainable and we hold that without a notification, the Bombay Act, could not be held to have been validly applied to the State of Kutch. This brings us to the second question, i.e., the validity of the notification issued on November 28, 1950. The learned Judicial Commissioner held:	Precedent

"Except as otherwise specifically provided in the first schedule to this order the enactments applied by this order shall be construed as if references therein to the authorities and territories mentioned in the first column of the table hereunder printed were references to the authorities and territories, respectively, mentioned opposite thereto in the second column of the said table.

4. Provinces of India, any Province Kutch or any part thereof of India or any part thereof.
5. The Province or Presidency of Kutch or any part thereof.Bombay or any part thereof.
6. " Any Court may construe the provisions of any enactment, rule, regulation, general order or byelaw applied to Kutch or any part thereof by this order, with such modifications not affecting the substance as may be necessary or proper in the circumstances." On August 1, 1949, Kutch became a Chief Commissioner's province under the States Merger (Chief Commissioners Provinces) Order, 1949. Clause 2(1)(c) of this order is as follows:
The Second Schedule gives the parts of the pre-1947 Indian States which were to comprise the Chief Commissioner's Province of Kutch. Under el. 4 of this Order all laws which were in force including orders made under s. 4 of the Extra Provincial Jurisdiction Act of 1947, were to continue in force until replaced.
On January 1, 1950, Merged States' Laws Act (Act LIX of 1949), came into force. By this Act certain Central Acts were extended to the province of Kutch including the General Clauses Act (Act X of 1897). On January 26, 1950, the Constitution of India came into force and Adaptation of Laws Order, 1950, was promulgated the same day. Clause 4(1) of this order provides:
The necessary portions of the table are:
In: order to decide the first contention we have to see what is the effect of the various provisions of the Acts and Orders above -referred to. In cl. 4 of the Kutch (Application of Laws) Order, 1949, the words; used are shall be construed as if reference therein....... In our opinion all that these words mean is I shall be read as' and if that is how these words are understood then wherever in the Bombay Act the words 'Provincial Government' are used they have to be read as the Chief Commissioner of Kutch; the word Government has to be read as the " Chief Commissioner of Kutch"; and the Province or the " Presidency of Bombay "
Clause 4 of the Adaptation of Laws Order, 1950 only substituted in place of the words Province, Provincial and Provinces the words State or States, wherever they occurred in any existing law, and the effect of cls. 15 and 16 of that order was the continuance of the powers vested in the authorities in whom they had previously been vested. The position which therefore emerges on a combined reading of these various clauses is that in Bombay Act, as applied to Kutch, the words I Presidency of Bombay' were to be replaced by the. words 'Kutch or any part thereof' and the I Provincial Government' by the I Chief Commissioner of Kutch' and the powers which had been given to the different authorities under the different Acts were to continue to remain in the person or persons in whom they were already vested. As the powers had been vested in the Chief Commissioner under the provisions of these various Acts and Orders, they continued to remain so vested and the General Clauses Act did not have any operational effect on these various words which were used in the Bombay Act as modified and applied to Kutch.
,SO understood, s. 1 of the Bombay Act would read as follows:-
The portion of this section, viz., "It extends to the city of Bombay, to the Island of Salsette, to all Railways and railway Station houses without the said city and island and to all places not more than three miles distant from any part of such station houses respectively " would not continue in the Act as applied to Kutch because these parts are not in the State of " Kutch or any part thereof " and cl. 6 of the Kutch (Application of Laws) Order, 1949 would come into operation for the purpose.
Article 239 of the Constitution relates to administration of Part C States and provides:	Section
The Chief Commissioner of Kutch may, from time to time, by an order published as aforesaid, cancel or vary any order made by it under this section."
In the result the appeal of the State is allowed, the judgment of the learned Judicial Commissioner acquitting the respondent is set aside and that of the learned Magistrate sentencing him to a fine of Rs. 50 and sentence in default and of forfeiture restored.
Appeal allowed.	Conclusion

He took a' revision to the Judicial Commissioner of Kutch, who hold that the Act under which the respondent had been convicted had not been validly extended to and was not. in force in the State of Kutch. It is the correctness of this decision which has been canvassed before us.
There was sufficient evidence against the respondent which was accepted by the trying magistrate; and if the Act was validly extended to and was in operation in the State of Kutch, his conviction by the learned magistrate was correct and his acquittal by the learned Judicial Commissioner erroneous.
On June 7, 1951, the respondent, it was alleged committed the offence he was charged with He was convicted by the magistrate on July 26, 1951, and his revision to the Sessions Judge was dismissed. He then took a revision to the Judicial Commissioner of Kutch who allowed his petition on June. 30, 1954, and granted a certificate under Arts. 132(1) and 134(1) of the Constitution.

" Any Court may construe the provisions of any enactment, rule, regulation, general order or byelaw applied to Kutch or any part thereof by this order, with such modifications not affecting the substance as may be necessary or proper in the circumstances." On August 1, 1949, Kutch became a Chief Commissioner's province under the States Merger (Chief Commissioners Provinces) Order, 1949. Clause 2(1)(c) of this order is as follows:
The Second Schedule gives the parts of the pre-1947 Indian States which were to comprise the Chief Commissioner's Province of Kutch. Under el. 4 of this Order all laws which were in force including orders made under s. 4 of the Extra Provincial Jurisdiction Act of 1947, were to continue in force until replaced.
On January 1, 1950, Merged States' Laws Act (Act LIX of 1949), came into force. By this Act certain Central Acts were extended to the province of Kutch including the General Clauses Act (Act X of 1897). On January 26, 1950, the Constitution of India came into force and Adaptation of Laws Order, 1950, was promulgated the same day. Clause 4(1) of this order provides:
The necessary portions of the table are:
On November 28, 1950 the Chief Commissioner of Kutch issued the following notification:
In: order to decide the first contention we have to see what is the effect of the various provisions of the Acts and Orders above -referred to. In cl. 4 of the Kutch (Application of Laws) Order, 1949, the words; used are shall be construed as if reference therein....... In our opinion all that these words mean is I shall be read as' and if that is how these words are understood then wherever in the Bombay Act the words 'Provincial Government' are used they have to be read as the Chief Commissioner of Kutch; the word Government has to be read as the " Chief Commissioner of Kutch"; and the Province or the " Presidency of Bombay "
Clause 4 of the Adaptation of Laws Order, 1950 only substituted in place of the words Province, Provincial and Provinces the words State or States, wherever they occurred in any existing law, and the effect of cls. 15 and 16 of that order was the continuance of the powers vested in the authorities in whom they had previously been vested. The position which therefore emerges on a combined reading of these various clauses is that in Bombay Act, as applied to Kutch, the words I Presidency of Bombay' were to be replaced by the. words 'Kutch or any part thereof' and the I Provincial Government' by the I Chief Commissioner of Kutch' and the powers which had been given to the different authorities under the different Acts were to continue to remain in the person or persons in whom they were already vested. As the powers had been vested in the Chief Commissioner under the provisions of these various Acts and Orders, they continued to remain so vested and the General Clauses Act did not have any operational effect on these various words which were used in the Bombay Act as modified and applied to Kutch.
,SO understood, s. 1 of the Bombay Act would read as follows:-
The Chief Commissioner of Kutch may, from time to time, by an order published as aforesaid, cancel or vary any order made by it under this section."
The portion of this section, viz., "It extends to the city of Bombay, to the Island of Salsette, to all Railways and railway Station houses without the said city and island and to all places not more than three miles distant from any part of such station houses respectively " would not continue in the Act as applied to Kutch because these parts are not in the State of " Kutch or any part thereof " and cl. 6 of the Kutch (Application of Laws) Order, 1949 would come into operation for the purpose.
It was then contended that by the mere application of the Bombay Act to Kutch it became operative and came into force in the whole of Kutch. This argument suffers from the infirmity that in its application to Kutch s. 1 of the Bombay Act would have to be excluded which would be an incorrect way of looking at the question. The true position is that the whole of the -Act including amended s. 1 as given above, became applicable to Kutch and therefore a notification ,was necessary before it could be brought into force in any part of Kutch. It was applied to Kutch, but its provisions were not in operation before the notification; and in our opinion, the judgment of Baxi J. C. in Agaria Osman Alarakhya v. The Kutch State (1) which has been followed in the case now before us, to the extent that it dealt with the necessity of a notification under s. 1 of the Bombay Act, was correctly decided; and therefore, the first contention raised by counsel for the appellant is unsustainable and we hold that without a notification, the Bombay Act, could not be held to have been validly applied to the State of Kutch. This brings us to the second question, i.e., the validity of the notification issued on November 28, 1950. The learned Judicial Commissioner held:
Article 239 of the Constitution relates to administration of Part C States and provides:
Order. The Chief Commissioner of Kutch under s. I of the Bombay Act, had the power to issue notifications making that Act operative in Kutch or any part of Kutch and those powers were not affected by Art. 239 of the Constitution particularly because of el. 15 of the Adaptation of Laws Order, 1950, which preserved these powers of the Chief Commissioner. Therefore, the notification issued by the Chief Commissioner on November 28, 1950 was valid and issued under legal authority; and the Act came into force in the parts to which the notification made it so applicable. We have therefore, come to the conclusion that the learned Judge was in error in holding that the notification was not a valid one and in so far as that was the basis of the acquittal of the accused, the judgment under appeal must be set aside.
In the result the appeal of the State is allowed, the judgment of the learned Judicial Commissioner acquitting the respondent is set aside and that of the learned Magistrate sentencing him to a fine of Rs. 50 and sentence in default and of forfeiture restored.
Appeal allowed.	Total Judgement
