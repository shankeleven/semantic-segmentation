It is not disputed that the Home Secretary was authorised to sanction a complaint for defamation of a Minister of the Government of Uttar Pradesh. The evidence clearly discloses that the Home Secretary had applied his mind to all the material facts before him and had then granted the sanction. Mere production of a document which sets out the names of the persons to be prosecuted and the provisions of the statute alleged to be contravened, and purporting to bear the signature of an officer competent to grant the sanction where such sanction is a condition precedent to the exercise of jurisdiction does not invest the court with jurisdiction to try the offence. If the facts which constitute the charge do not appear on the face of the sanction, it must be established by hose facts were laced before the authority competent to grant the sanction and that the authority applied his mind to those facts before giving sanction. In the present case, the facts constituting the charge appear on the face of the sanction ; and evidence has also been led that the facts were placed before the sanctioning authority, that the authority considered the facts and sanctioned the prosecution. Section 198B which deals with a certain category of the offences of defamation of high dignitaries of the State, and of Ministers and public servants in respect of their conduct in the discharge of public functions was incorporated in the Code by Act XVI of 1955. Prior to the incorporation of s. 198B, the only condition precedent to the entertainment of a complaint of defamation by a court competent in that behalf was prescribed by s. 198, viz., that there had to be a complaint by the person aggrieved before the court took cognisance of that offence. By s. 198B, several conditions precedent to the trial of offences falling within that section are prescribed. The material clauses of s. 198B are sub-ss. (1), (3) and (4). (1):- " notwithstanding anything contained in this Code, when any offence falling under Chapter XXI of the Indian Penal Code (Act XLV of 1860) (other than the offence of defamation by spoken words) is alleged to have been committed against the President or the Vice-President, or the Governor or Rajpramukh of a State, or a Minister or any other public servant employed in connection with the affairs of the Union or of a State, in respect of his conduct in the discharge of his public functions, a Court of Session may take cognisance of such offence, without the accused being committed to it for trial, upon a complaint in writing made by the Public Prosecutor.

RespArg
This section provides for a special procedure for the trial of the offence of defamation of certain specified classes of persons. The conditions necessary for the applicability of sub-s. (1) of s. 198B are:
The Court of Session may entertain a complaint of defamation of the high dignitaries and of Ministers and public servants in respect of their conduct in the discharge of their public functions only if these conditions exist. Section 198 require,% that a complaint for defamation may be initiated by the person aggrieved and no period of limitation is prescribed in that behalf. Such a complaint can only be entertained by a Magistrate of the First Class. But s. 198- B in the larger public interest, has made a departure from that rule; the accusation is to be entertained not by a Magistrate, but by the Court of Session without a committal within six months of the date of the offence on a complaint in writing by the Public Prosecutor with the previous sanction of the specified authorities. It is manifest that by the non-obstante clause, " notwithstanding anything contained in this Code " in sub.s. (1), the operation of diverse provisions of the Code relating to the initiation and trial of the offence of defamation is excluded and prima facie s. 198 is one of those provisions. It is however urged on behalf of the appellants that sub-s. (13) of s. 198-B makes the provisions of s. 198 applicable to a complaint for defamation of persons specified in s. 198-B(1) and provides that cognisance of the offence of defamation cannot be taken by a court except upon a complaint by the person aggrieved, and that the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh alleged to be the party aggrieved not having signed the complaint the Court of Session, Kanpur, had no jurisdiction to take cognisance of the complaint. Sub-section (13) provides that " the provisions of this section shall be in addition to, and not in derogation of, those of s. 198 ". In our judgment, this clause is enacted with a view to state ex abundanti cautela that the right of a party aggrieved by publication of a defamatory statement to proceed under s. 198 is not derogated by the enactment of s. 198-B. The expressions, "	Section

The observation made by Mr. Justice Bavdekar in C. B. L. Bhatnagar v. The State (1) " What s. 198B(13) ......... means...... is that any complaint which may be made under s. 198B must also satisy the provisions of s. 198, that is, the complaint will have to be made both by the person aggrieved, and by the Public Prosecutor ", and by Mr. Justice Raman Nayar in R. Sanker v. The State (2) that a complaint by a person aggrieved is not dispensed with even in regard to cases falling under s. 198B, do not, in our judgment, correctly interpret sub.s. (13) of s. 198B. In the view taken by us, this appeal must fail and is dismissed.

This section provides for a special procedure for the trial of the offence of defamation of certain specified classes of persons. The conditions necessary for the applicability of sub-s. (1) of s. 198B are:
The Court of Session may entertain a complaint of defamation of the high dignitaries and of Ministers and public servants in respect of their conduct in the discharge of their public functions only if these conditions exist. Section 198 require,% that a complaint for defamation may be initiated by the person aggrieved and no period of limitation is prescribed in that behalf. Such a complaint can only be entertained by a Magistrate of the First Class. But s. 198- B in the larger public interest, has made a departure from that rule; the accusation is to be entertained not by a Magistrate, but by the Court of Session without a committal within six months of the date of the offence on a complaint in writing by the Public Prosecutor with the previous sanction of the specified authorities. It is manifest that by the non-obstante clause, " notwithstanding anything contained in this Code " in sub.s. (1), the operation of diverse provisions of the Code relating to the initiation and trial of the offence of defamation is excluded and prima facie s. 198 is one of those provisions. It is however urged on behalf of the appellants that sub-s. (13) of s. 198-B makes the provisions of s. 198 applicable to a complaint for defamation of persons specified in s. 198-B(1) and provides that cognisance of the offence of defamation cannot be taken by a court except upon a complaint by the person aggrieved, and that the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh alleged to be the party aggrieved not having signed the complaint the Court of Session, Kanpur, had no jurisdiction to take cognisance of the complaint. Sub-section (13) provides that " the provisions of this section shall be in addition to, and not in derogation of, those of s. 198 ". In our judgment, this clause is enacted with a view to state ex abundanti cautela that the right of a party aggrieved by publication of a defamatory statement to proceed under s. 198 is not derogated by the enactment of s. 198-B. The expressions, "
in s. 198 is manifestly used in the meaning as defined by s. 4(h). Even a superficial examination of the contention raised by the appellants reveals that if effect be given to it, the utmost confusion would result in working out the provisions of the Code. If beside the complaint filed by the Public Prosecutor under s. 198B, there must also be a complaint by the person aggrieved, two courts would simultaneously be seized of two distinct complaints for the same offence. The complaint by the Public Prosecutor under s. 198B would undoubtedly lie, in the Court of Session and the complaint under s. 198 would lie in the court of a Magistrate, because it is a Magistrate who alone can take cognisance of the offence of defamation under s. 198. Thereafter, the complaint under s. 198 may have to be committed to the Court of Session by the Magistrate and it is only after the compliant filed by the Public Prosecutor, the case may proceed. The Legislature could not have intended that in respect of the same offence, there should be two complaints, one in the Court of Session and another in the court of a Magistrate-and either both should be tried, or the proceedings should be consolidated after committal. Reliance was placed on behalf of the appellants upon sub-ss. (6) to 11 of s. 198B which provide for the award of compensation to the person accused if the court is satisfied that the accusation is false and either frivolous or vexatious, and it was submitted that the Legislature could not have intended that a person who was not the complainant and who was not directly concerned with the proceedings may still be required if so ordered by the court to pay compensation. But sub-s. (5) which provides that a person against whom the offence is alleged to have been committed shall, unless the court for reasons to be recorded otherwise directs, be examined as a witness for the prosecution, clearly indicates that the question whether the complaint was false and either frivolous or vexatious may fall to be determined only if the person complaining to be defamed actively supports the complaint. It cannot therefore be said that s. 198B provides for compensation being awarded against a person who is not concerned with the complaint. Section 198B is enacted to provide machinery for vindicating the conduct of high dignitaries, Ministers and public servants when they are exposed to defamatory attacks. The section contemplates the institution of proceedings for defamation of two different classes of persons, (1) high dignitaries like the President, the Vice-President, the Governors and Rajpramukhs and (2) Ministers and public servants. it is not disputed that a provision which enables a prosecution to be launched by the State, and at State expense for defamation of members of the first class, having regard to their status in public life, is pre-eminently designed in the public interest, and it would be entirely appropriate that any question of awarding compensation should be raised, even if the complaint for defamation be found to be false and frivolous or vexatious. There can be no doubt that in a democratic set up, in order to maintain purity of public behaviour and administration, charges of improper conduct against persons in the second class, in so far as such charges relate to the discharge of their public functions should be investigated. It is also in the public interest that in vindicating his character or conduct, the person defamed should not ordinarily be called upon to bear the burden of what may turn out an expensive and long drawn out proceeding, nor for obvious reasons should he have control over the proceeding. In the vindication of the character or conduct of a private individual who is defamed, the State is primarily not concerned: the party aggrieved may, if he is so minded, take proceedings for obtaining relief. But in the investigation of defamatory charges against Ministers and public servants in the discharge of their public functions, the State is as vitally concerned as the individual defamed. The Legislature has therefore authorised the State to take upon itself the power in appropriate cases to prosecute the offenders. But lest this procedure be abused, provision has been made for the examination of the person defamed and for awarding against him compensation if it be found that the complaint was false and frivolous or vexatious. Normally, a Minister or a public servant defamed in respect of his conduct in the discharge of his public functions would himself move the Government under which he functions for taking proceedings for vindicating his character or conduct. The complaint eo nomine in cases under s. 198B, is undoubtedly the Public Prosecutor, but the complaint may, when the person defamed is a Minister or a public servant, properly be regarded as filed at the instance of such Minister or public servant. He has in any case to support the accusation by evidence, and his conduct is exposed to judicial scrutiny. In this context, it would be difficult to hold that a person who has either been instrumental in the initiation of a complaint, or in any event has to support it by his evidence, has no concern with the lodging of the complaint. The court would obviously award compensation only if it is satisfied that the claim made by the person posing to be aggrieved is false and either frivolous or vexatious.
Section 198B does not provide that before taking cognisance of a complaint, the complaint shall be signed by any person other than the Public Prosecutor. In terms, it contemplates a complaint in writing by the Public Prosecutor and of no one else and it would be an unwarranted addition to sub-s. (1) of the words " and also by the person aggrieved " if the contention urged on behalf of the appellants were ac- cepted. The Legislature not having chosen to provide that the complaint of the Public Prosecutor shall also be signed by the person aggrieved, we will not be justified in the absence of compelling reasons to so hold.
The observation made by Mr. Justice Bavdekar in C. B. L. Bhatnagar v. The State (1) " What s. 198B(13) ......... means...... is that any complaint which may be made under s. 198B must also satisy the provisions of s. 198, that is, the complaint will have to be made both by the person aggrieved, and by the Public Prosecutor ", and by Mr. Justice Raman Nayar in R.
